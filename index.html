                  <p>Despite the development of various deep learning methods for Wi-Fi sensing, package loss often results in noncontinuous estimation of the Channel State Information (CSI), which negatively impacts the performance of the learning models.To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep learning model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for CSI recovery, named CSI-BERT.CSI-BERT can be trained in an self-supervised manner on the target dataset without the need for additional data.Furthermore, unlike traditional interpolation methods that focus on one subcarrier at a time, CSI-BERT captures the sequential relationships across different subcarriers.Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT achieves lower error rates and faster speed compared to traditional interpolation methods, even when facing with high loss rates.Moreover, by harnessing the recovered CSI obtained from CSI-BERT, other deep learning models like Residual Network and Recurrent Neural Network can achieve an average increase in accuracy of approximately 15\% in Wi-Fi sensing tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The collected dataset WiGesture and code for our model are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CSI-BERT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset.We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>

                  <p>Real-world multi-modal problems are rarely solved by a single machine learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve stitching several models.Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for automating the generation of such computational plans.However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions.Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step?Should they invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like JSON?Does feedback improve planning?To answer these questions and more, we introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and image processing modules.For each of these task queries, we provide automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset.We further provide a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly executable.With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies (multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3 types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution).Finally, we summarize takeaways from our extensive experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github (https://github.com/RAIVNLab/mnms). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.839</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sequential recommender systems (SRS) are designed to predict users' future behaviors based on their historical interaction data.Recent research has increasingly utilized contrastive learning (CL) to leverage unsupervised signals to alleviate the data sparsity issue in SRS.In general, CL-based SRS first augments the raw sequential interaction data by using data augmentation strategies and employs a contrastive training scheme to enforce the representations of those sequences from the same raw interaction data to be similar.Despite the growing popularity of CL, data augmentation, as a basic component of CL, has not received sufficient attention.This raises the question: Is it possible to achieve superior recommendation results solely through data augmentation?To answer this question, we benchmark eight widely used data augmentation strategies, as well as state-of-the-art CL-based SRS methods, on four real-world datasets under both warm- and cold-start settings.Intriguingly, the conclusion drawn from our study is that, certain data augmentation strategies can achieve similar or even superior performance compared with some CL-based methods, demonstrating the potential to significantly alleviate the data sparsity issue with fewer computational overhead.We hope that our study can further inspire more fundamental studies on the key functional components of complex CL techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our processed datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/AIM-SE/DA4Rec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pre-trained large multi-modal models (LMMs) exploit fine-tuning to adapt diverse user applications.Nevertheless, fine-tuning may face challenges due to deactivated sensors (e.g., cameras turned off for privacy or technical issues), yielding modality-incomplete data and leading to inconsistency in training data and the data for inference.Additionally, continuous training leads to catastrophic forgetting, diluting the knowledge in pre-trained LMMs.To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task, Continual Missing Modality Learning (CMML), to investigate how models can generalize when data of certain modalities is missing during continual fine-tuning.Our preliminary benchmarks reveal that existing methods suffer from a significant performance drop in CMML, even with the aid of advanced continual learning techniques.Therefore, we devise a framework termed Reconstruct before Query (RebQ).It decomposes prompts into modality-specific ones and breaks them into components stored in pools accessible via a key-query mechanism, which facilitates ParameterEfficient Fine-Tuning and enhances knowledge transferability for subsequent tasks.Meanwhile, our RebQ leverages extensive multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained LMMs to reconstruct the data of missing modality.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RebQ effectively reconstructs the missing modality information and retains pre-trained knowledge.Specifically, compared with the baseline, RebQ improves average precision from 20.00 to 50.92 and decreases average forgetting from 75.95 to 8.56.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are available on https://github.com/Tree-Shu-Zhao/RebQ.pytorch <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span></p>

                  <p>We study the problem of robust multivariate polynomial regression: let $p\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be an unknown $n$-variate polynomial of degree at most $d$ in each variable.We are given as input a set of random samples $(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\in[-1,1]^n \times \mathbb{R}$that are noisy versions of $(\mathbf{x}_i,p(\mathbf{x}_i))$. More precisely, each $\mathbf{x}_i$ is sampled independently from some distribution $\chi$ on $[-1,1]^n$, and for each $i$ independently, $y_i$ is arbitrary (i.e., an outlier) with probability at most $\rho < 1/2$, and otherwise satisfies $|y_i-p(\mathbf{x}_i)|\leq\sigma$.The goal is to output a polynomial $\hat{p}$, of degree at most $d$ in each variable, within an $\ell_\infty$-distance of at most $O(\sigma)$ from $p$.

We generalize their results to the $n$-variate setting, showing an algorithm that achieves a sample complexity of $O_n(d^n\log d)$, where the hidden constant depends on $n$, if $\chi$ is the $n$-dimensional Chebyshev distribution.The sample complexity is $O_n(d^{2n}\log d)$, if the samples are drawn from the uniform distribution instead.The approximation error is guaranteed to be at most $O(\sigma)$, and the run-time depends on $\log(1/\sigma)$. In the setting where each $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $y_i$ are known up to $N$ bits of precision, the run-time's dependence on $N$ is linear.We also show that our sample complexities are optimal in terms of $d^n$. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to have the run-time be independent of $1/\sigma$, at the cost of a higher sample complexity.</p>

                  <p>Echocardiography (echo) is the first imaging modality used when assessing cardiac function.The measurement of functional biomarkers from echo relies upon the segmentation of cardiac structures and deep learning models have been proposed to automate the segmentation process.However, in order to translate these tools to widespread clinical use it is important that the segmentation models are robust to a wide variety of images (e.g. acquired from different scanners, by operators with different levels of expertise etc.).To achieve this level of robustness it is necessary that the models are trained with multiple diverse datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A significant challenge faced when training with multiple diverse datasets is the variation in label presence, i.e. the combined data are often partially-labelled. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Adaptations of the cross entropy loss function have been proposed to deal with partially labelled data.In this paper we show that training naively with such a loss function and multiple diverse datasets can lead to a form of shortcut learning, where the model associates label presence with domain characteristics, leading to a drop in performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, we propose a novel label dropout scheme to break the link between domain characteristics and the presence or absence of labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>We demonstrate that label dropout improves echo segmentation Dice score by 62% and 25% on two cardiac structures when training using multiple diverse partially labelled datasets.</p>

                  <p>Current approaches in pose estimation primarily concentrate on enhancing model architectures, often overlooking the importance of comprehensively understanding the rationale behind model decisions.In this paper, we propose XPose, a novel framework that incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) principles into pose estimation.This integration aims to elucidate the individual contribution of each keypoint to final prediction, thereby elevating the model's transparency and interpretability.Conventional XAI techniques have predominantly addressed tasks with single-target tasks like classification.Additionally, the application of Shapley value, a common measure in XAI, to pose estimation has been hindered by prohibitive computational demands.   To address these challenges, this work introduces an innovative concept called Group Shapley Value (GSV).This approach strategically organizes keypoints into clusters based on their interdependencies.Within these clusters, GSV meticulously calculates Shapley value for keypoints, while for inter-cluster keypoints, it opts for a more holistic group-level valuation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dual-level computation framework meticulously assesses keypoint contributions to the final outcome, optimizing computational efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Building on the insights into keypoint interactions, we devise a novel data augmentation technique known as Group-based Keypoint Removal (GKR).This method ingeniously removes individual keypoints during training phases, deliberately preserving those with strong mutual connections, thereby refining the model's predictive prowess for non-visible keypoints.The empirical validation of GKR across a spectrum of standard approaches attests to its efficacy.GKR's success demonstrates how using Explainable AI (XAI) can directly enhance pose estimation models.</p>

We present algorithms that use structure-aware query evaluation techniques to obtain the smallest possible groundings.Next, efficient algorithms for fixpoint evaluation are introduced over two classes of semirings: (1) finite-rank semirings and (2) absorptive semirings of total order.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Combining both phases, we obtain state-of-the-art and new algorithmic results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we complement our results with a matching fine-grained lower bound. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as one of the most successful paradigms for unsupervised visual representation learning, yet it often depends on intensive manual data augmentations.With the rise of generative models, especially diffusion models, the ability to generate realistic images close to the real data distribution has been well recognized.These generated high-equality images have been successfully applied to enhance contrastive representation learning, a technique termed ``data inflation''.However, we find that the generated data (even from a good diffusion model like DDPM) may sometimes even harm contrastive learning.We investigate the causes behind this failure from the perspective of both data inflation and data augmentation.For the first time, we reveal the complementary roles that stronger data inflation should be accompanied by weaker augmentations, and vice versa.We also provide rigorous theoretical explanations for these phenomena via deriving its generalization bounds under data inflation.Drawing from these insights, we propose Adaptive Inflation (AdaInf), a purely data-centric strategy without introducing any extra computation cost.On benchmark datasets, AdaInf can bring significant improvements for various contrastive learning methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, without using external data, AdaInf obtains 94.70% linear accuracy on CIFAR-10 with SimCLR, setting a new record that surpasses many sophisticated methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/adainf.</p>

                  <p>Microservice architectures emerged as a popular architecture for designing scalable distributed applications.Although microservices have been extensively employed in industry settings for over a decade, there is little understanding of the data management challenges that arise in these applications.As a result, it is difficult to advance data system technologies for supporting microservice applications.To fill this gap, we present Online Marketplace, a microservice benchmark that incorporates core data management challenges that existing benchmarks have not sufficiently addressed.These challenges include transaction processing, query processing, event processing, constraint enforcement, and data replication.We have defined criteria for various data management issues to enable proper comparison across data systems and platforms.

                  <p>Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs) are often used for semi-supervised anomaly detection, where they are trained using only normal data points.In GBRBM-based anomaly detection, normal and anomalous data are classified based on a score that is identical to an energy function of the marginal GBRBM.However, the classification threshold is difficult to set to an appropriate value, as this score cannot be interpreted.In this study, we propose a measure that improves score's interpretability based on its cumulative distribution, and establish a guideline for setting the threshold using the interpretable measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results of numerical experiments show that the guideline is reasonable when setting the threshold solely using normal data points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Moreover, because identifying the measure involves computationally infeasible evaluation of the minimum score value, we also propose an evaluation method for the minimum score based on simulated annealing, which is widely used for optimization problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed evaluation method was also validated using numerical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span></p>

                  <p>Alcohol consumption has a significant impact on individuals' health, with even more pronounced consequences when consumption becomes excessive.One approach to promoting healthier drinking habits is implementing just-in-time interventions, where timely notifications indicating intoxication are sent during heavy drinking episodes.However, the complexity or invasiveness of an intervention mechanism may deter an individual from using them in practice.Previous research tackled this challenge using collected motion data and conventional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking episodes, but with impractical accuracy and computational efficiency for mobile devices.Consequently, we have elected to use Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to design a just-in-time intervention approach that is practical for smartphones, smart wearables, and IoT deployment.HDC is a framework that has proven results in processing real-time sensor data efficiently.This approach offers several advantages, including low latency, minimal power consumption, and high parallelism.We explore various HDC encoding designs and combine them with various HDC learning models to create an optimal and feasible approach for mobile devices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate an accuracy rate of 89\%, which represents a substantial 12\% improvement over the current state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is widely employed in IoT applications to handle high-volume, non-iid client data while ensuring data privacy.However, heterogeneous edge devices owned by clients may impose varying degrees of resource constraints, causing computation and communication bottlenecks for PFL.Federated Dropout has emerged as a popular strategy to address this challenge, wherein only a subset of the global model, i.e. a \textit{sub-model}, is trained on a client's device, thereby reducing computation and communication overheads.Nevertheless, the dropout-based model-pruning strategy may introduce bias, particularly towards non-iid local data.When biased sub-models absorb highly divergent parameters from other clients, performance degradation becomes inevitable.In response, we propose federated learning with stochastic parameter update (FedSPU).Unlike dropout that tailors the global model to small-size local sub-models, FedSPU maintains the full model architecture on each device but randomly freezes a certain percentage of neurons in the local model during training while updating the remaining neurons.This approach ensures that a portion of the local model remains personalized, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against biased parameters from other clients.Experimental results demonstrate that FedSPU outperforms federated dropout by 7.57\% on average in terms of accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, an introduced early stopping scheme leads to a significant reduction of the training time by \(24.8\%\sim70.4\%\) while maintaining high accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-world semi-supervised learning (Open-world SSL) for node classification, that classifies unlabeled nodes into seen classes or multiple novel classes, is a practical but under-explored problem in the graph community.As only seen classes have human labels, they are usually better learned than novel classes, and thus exhibit smaller intra-class variances within the embedding space (named as imbalance of intra-class variances between seen and novel classes).Based on empirical and theoretical analysis, we find the variance imbalance can negatively impact the model performance.Pre-trained feature encoders can alleviate this issue via producing compact representations for novel classes.However, creating general pre-trained encoders for various types of graph data has been proven to be challenging.As such, there is a demand for an effective method that does not rely on pre-trained graph encoders.In this paper, we propose an IMbalance-Aware method named OpenIMA for Open-world semi-supervised node classification, which trains the node classification model from scratch via contrastive learning with bias-reduced pseudo labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on seven popular graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenIMA, and the source code has been available on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel reactive motion planning framework for navigating robots in unknown and cluttered 2D workspace.Typical existing methods are developed by enforcing the robot staying in free regions represented by the locally extracted ellipse or polygon.Instead, we navigate the robot in free space with an alternate starshaped decomposition, which is calculated directly from real-time sensor data.Additionally, a roadmap is constructed incrementally to maintain the connectivity information of the starshaped regions.Compared to the roadmap built upon connected polygons or ellipses in the conventional approaches, the concave starshaped region is better suited to capture the natural distribution of sensor data, so that the perception information can be fully exploited for robot navigation.In this sense, conservative and myopic behaviors are avoided with the proposed approach, and intricate obstacle configurations can be suitably accommodated in unknown and cluttered environments.Then, we design a heuristic exploration algorithm on the roadmap to determine the frontier points of the starshaped regions, from which short-term goals are selected to attract the robot towards the goal configuration.It is noteworthy that, a recovery mechanism is developed on the roadmap that is triggered once a non-extendable short-term goal is reached.This mechanism renders it possible to deal with dead-end situations that can be typically encountered in unknown and cluttered environments.Furthermore, safe and smooth motion within the starshaped regions is generated by employing the Dynamical System Modulation (DSM) approach on the constructed roadmap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive evaluation in both simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of success rate and traveling time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span></p>

                  <p>Typical LiDAR-based 3D object detection models are trained in a supervised manner with real-world data collection, which is often imbalanced over classes (or long-tailed).To deal with it, augmenting minority-class examples by sampling ground truth (GT) LiDAR points from a database and pasting them into a scene of interest is often used, but challenges still remain: inflexibility in locating GT samples and limited sample diversity.In this work, we propose to leverage pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated (at a low cost) from videos capturing a surround view of miniatures or real-world objects of minor classes.Our method, called Pseudo Ground Truth Augmentation (PGT-Aug), consists of three main steps: (i) volumetric 3D instance reconstruction using a 2D-to-3D view synthesis model, (ii) object-level domain alignment with LiDAR intensity estimation and (iii) a hybrid context-aware placement method from ground and map information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the superiority and generality of our method through performance improvements in extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes, KITTI, and Lyft, especially for the datasets with large domain gaps captured by different LiDAR configurations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Our code and data will be publicly available upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Few-shot segmentation models excel in metal defect detection due to their rapid generalization ability to new classes and pixel-level segmentation, rendering them ideal for addressing data scarcity issues and achieving refined object delineation in industrial applications.Existing works neglect the \textit{Intra-Class Differences}, inherent in metal surface defect data, which hinders the model from learning sufficient knowledge from the support set to guide the query set segmentation.Specifically, it can be categorized into two types: the \textit{Semantic Difference} induced by internal factors in metal samples and the \textit{Distortion Difference} caused by external factors of surroundings.To address these differences, we introduce a \textbf{L}ocal d\textbf{E}scriptor based \textbf{R}easoning and \textbf{E}xcitation \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{LERENet}) to learn the two-view guidance, i.e., local and global information from the graph and feature space, and fuse them to segment precisely.Since the relation structure of local features embedded in graph space will help to eliminate \textit{Semantic Difference}, we employ Multi-Prototype Reasoning (MPR) module, extracting local descriptors based prototypes and analyzing local-view feature relevance in support-query pairs.Besides, due to the global information that will assist in countering the \textit{Distortion Difference} in observations, we utilize Multi-Prototype Excitation (MPE) module to capture the global-view relations in support-query pairs.Finally, we employ an Information Fusion Module (IFM) to fuse learned prototypes in local and global views to generate pixel-level masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive experiments on defect datasets demonstrate that it outperforms existing benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D human pose data collected in controlled laboratory settings present challenges for pose estimators that generalize across diverse scenarios.To address this, domain generalization is employed.Current methodologies in domain generalization for 3D human pose estimation typically utilize adversarial training to generate synthetic poses for training.Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit several limitations.First, the lack of prior information about the target domain complicates the application of suitable augmentation through a single pose augmentor, affecting generalization on target domains.Moreover, adversarial training's discriminator tends to enforce similarity between source and synthesized poses, impeding the exploration of out-of-source distributions.Furthermore, the pose estimator's optimization is not exposed to domain shifts, limiting its overall generalization ability.   To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework featuring two pose augmentors: the weak and the strong augmentors.Our framework employs differential strategies for generation and discrimination processes, facilitating the preservation of knowledge related to source poses and the exploration of out-of-source distributions without prior information about target poses.Besides, we leverage meta-optimization to simulate domain shifts in the optimization process of the pose estimator, thereby improving its generalization ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel system designed for 3D mapping and visual relocalization using 3D Gaussian Splatting.Our proposed method uses LiDAR and camera data to create accurate and visually plausible representations of the environment.By leveraging LiDAR data to initiate the training of the 3D Gaussian Splatting map, our system constructs maps that are both detailed and geometrically accurate.To mitigate excessive GPU memory usage and facilitate rapid spatial queries, we employ a combination of a 2D voxel map and a KD-tree.This preparation makes our method well-suited for visual localization tasks, enabling efficient identification of correspondences between the query image and the rendered image from the Gaussian Splatting map via normalized cross-correlation (NCC).Additionally, we refine the camera pose of the query image using feature-based matching and the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness, adaptability, and precision of our system are demonstrated through extensive evaluation on the KITTI360 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing.Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data.With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities.However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset.Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation.In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space.Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency.Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns.Our implementation is available at https://github.com/WAL-l/SeisFusion.</p>

This completely resolves the question of the minimum size of conditioning sets required to learn the graph.When it comes to the number of tests, our upper bound on the sizes of conditioning sets implies that every $n$-vertex graph can be learned by at most $n^{\kappa}$ tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $\kappa$. We show that for any upper bound $q$ on the sizes of the conditioning sets, there exist graphs with $O(n q)$ vertices that require at least $n^{\Omega(\kappa)}$ tests to learn.This lower bound holds even when the treewidth and the maximum degree of the graph are at most $\kappa+2$.

                  <p>Medical image classification requires labeled, task-specific datasets which are used to train deep learning networks de novo, or to fine-tune foundation models.However, this process is computationally and technically demanding.In language processing, in-context learning provides an alternative, where models learn from within prompts, bypassing the need for parameter updates.Yet, in-context learning remains underexplored in medical image analysis.Here, we systematically evaluate the model Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 with Vision capabilities (GPT-4V) on cancer image processing with in-context learning on three cancer histopathology tasks of high importance: Classification of tissue subtypes in colorectal cancer, colon polyp subtyping and breast tumor detection in lymph node sections.Our results show that in-context learning is sufficient to match or even outperform specialized neural networks trained for particular tasks, while only requiring a minimal number of samples.In summary, this study demonstrates that large vision language models trained on non-domain specific data can be applied out-of-the box to solve medical image-processing tasks in histopathology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This democratizes access of generalist AI models to medical experts without technical background especially for areas where annotated data is scarce. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current approaches in pose estimation primarily concentrate on enhancing model architectures, often overlooking the importance of comprehensively understanding the rationale behind model decisions.In this paper, we propose XPose, a novel framework that incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) principles into pose estimation.This integration aims to elucidate the individual contribution of each keypoint to final prediction, thereby elevating the model's transparency and interpretability.Conventional XAI techniques have predominantly addressed tasks with single-target tasks like classification.Additionally, the application of Shapley value, a common measure in XAI, to pose estimation has been hindered by prohibitive computational demands.   To address these challenges, this work introduces an innovative concept called Group Shapley Value (GSV).This approach strategically organizes keypoints into clusters based on their interdependencies.Within these clusters, GSV meticulously calculates Shapley value for keypoints, while for inter-cluster keypoints, it opts for a more holistic group-level valuation.This dual-level computation framework meticulously assesses keypoint contributions to the final outcome, optimizing computational efficiency.Building on the insights into keypoint interactions, we devise a novel data augmentation technique known as Group-based Keypoint Removal (GKR).This method ingeniously removes individual keypoints during training phases, deliberately preserving those with strong mutual connections, thereby refining the model's predictive prowess for non-visible keypoints.The empirical validation of GKR across a spectrum of standard approaches attests to its efficacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GKR's success demonstrates how using Explainable AI (XAI) can directly enhance pose estimation models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span></p>

Towards practical attack detection and investigation with provenance graphs, we propose TAGS, a tag-propagation-based streaming provenance graph alignment system.Utilizing the tag-based intermediate result caching mechanism alongside carefully crafted propagation rules, we eliminate the need to store and duplicate raw data processing.This approach effectively mitigates in-memory storage requirements and minimizes data processing overhead, facilitating rapid on-stream graph alignment while significantly conserving CPU and memory resources.As a result, TAGS can detect and investigate various cyber-attacks in real-time.Moreover, TAGS allows analysts to customize attack query graphs flexibly to identify extended attacks in data streams.   We conduct experimental evaluations on two large-scale public datasets containing 257.42 GB of audit logs with 12 relevant query graphs of varying sizes, covering multiple attack techniques and scenarios.The results demonstrate that TAGS is sufficiently efficient to process 176K events per second while sufficiently accurately identifying all 29 alignments in massive data.Moreover, it can effectively handle the dependency explosion problem with steady, low-level memory consumption (less than 300MB), producing only 3 false positives.Overall, the performance of TAGS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>In this study, we introduce a novel visual imitation network with a spatial attention module for robotic assisted feeding (RAF).The goal is to acquire (i.e., scoop) food items from a bowl.However, achieving robust and adaptive food manipulation is particularly challenging.To deal with this, we propose a framework that integrates visual perception with imitation learning to enable the robot to handle diverse scenarios during scooping.Our approach, named AVIL (adaptive visual imitation learning), exhibits adaptability and robustness across different bowl configurations in terms of material, size, and position, as well as diverse food types including granular, semi-solid, and liquid, even in the presence of distractors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on a real robot. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.539</span></span>We also compare its performance with a baseline.The results demonstrate improvement over the baseline across all scenarios, with an enhancement of up to 2.5 times in terms of a success metric.Notably, our model, trained solely on data from a transparent glass bowl containing granular cereals, showcases generalization ability when tested zero-shot on other bowl configurations with different types of food.</p>

In this paper, we present Pencil, the first private training framework for collaborative learning that simultaneously offers data privacy, model privacy, and extensibility to multiple data providers, without relying on the non-colluding assumption.Our fundamental design principle is to construct the n-party collaborative training protocol based on an efficient two-party protocol, and meanwhile ensuring that switching to different data providers during model training introduces no extra cost.We introduce several novel cryptographic protocols to realize this design principle and conduct a rigorous security and privacy analysis.Our comprehensive evaluations of Pencil demonstrate that (i) models trained in plaintext and models trained privately using Pencil exhibit nearly identical test accuracies; (ii) The training overhead of Pencil is greatly reduced: Pencil achieves 10 ~ 260x higher throughput and 2 orders of magnitude less communication than prior art; (iii) Pencil is resilient against both existing and adaptive (white-box) attacks.</p>
