                  <p>As the utilization of large language models (LLMs) has proliferated worldwide, it is crucial for them to have adequate knowledge and fair representation for diverse global cultures.In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM.We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures.We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation.Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and Data can be found in: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.918</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent communications have played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of 6G networks.Native artificial intelligence (AI) within green communication systems must meet stringent real-time requirements.To achieve this, deploying lightweight and resource-efficient AI models is necessary.However, as wireless networks generate a multitude of data fields and indicators during operation, only a fraction of them imposes significant impact on the network AI models.Therefore, real-time intelligence of communication systems heavily relies on a small but critical set of the data that profoundly influences the performance of network AI models.These challenges underscore the need for innovative architectures and solutions.In this paper, we propose a solution, termed the pervasive multi-level (PML) native AI architecture, which integrates the concept of knowledge graph (KG) into the intelligent operational manipulations of mobile networks, resulting in the establishment of a wireless data KG.Leveraging the wireless data KG, we characterize the massive and complex data collected from wireless communication networks and analyze the relationships among various data fields.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained graph of data field relations enables the on-demand generation of minimal and effective datasets, referred to as feature datasets, tailored to specific application requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Consequently, this architecture not only enhances AI training, inference, and validation processes but also significantly reduces resource wastage and overhead for communication networks.To implement this architecture, we have developed a specific solution comprising a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph attention neural network model (STREAM) as well as a feature dataset generation algorithm.Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.</p>

                  <p>Task-oriented grasping (TOG), which refers to the problem of synthesizing grasps on an object that are configurationally compatible with the downstream manipulation task, is the first milestone towards tool manipulation.Analogous to the activation of two brain regions responsible for semantic and geometric reasoning during cognitive processes, modeling the complex relationship between objects, tasks, and grasps requires rich prior knowledge about objects and tasks.Existing methods typically limit the prior knowledge to a closed-set scope and cannot support the generalization to novel objects and tasks out of the training set.To address such a limitation, we propose FoundationGrasp, a foundation model-based TOG framework that leverages the open-ended knowledge from foundation models to learn generalizable TOG skills.Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the contributed Language and Vision Augmented TaskGrasp (LaViA-TaskGrasp) dataset, demonstrating the superiority of FoudationGrasp over existing methods when generalizing to novel object instances, object classes, and tasks out of the training set.Furthermore, the effectiveness of FoudationGrasp is validated in real-robot grasping and manipulation experiments on a 7 DoF robotic arm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, data, appendix, and video are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/foundationgrasp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination.However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark.Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods.Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max.Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction.Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes.Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD.Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents an exploration of preference learning in text-to-motion generation.We find that current improvements in text-to-motion generation still rely on datasets requiring expert labelers with motion capture systems.Instead, learning from human preference data does not require motion capture systems; a labeler with no expertise simply compares two generated motions.This is particularly efficient because evaluating the model's output is easier than gathering the motion that performs a desired task (e.g. backflip).To pioneer the exploration of this paradigm, we annotate 3,528 preference pairs generated by MotionGPT, marking the first effort to investigate various algorithms for learning from preference data.In particular, our exploration highlights important design choices when using preference data.Additionally, our experimental results show that preference learning has the potential to greatly improve current text-to-motion generative models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/THU-LYJ-Lab/InstructMotion}{https://github.com/THU-LYJ-Lab/InstructMotion to further facilitate research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKG) store structured world knowledge containing rich multi-modal descriptive information.To overcome their inherent incompleteness, multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover unobserved knowledge from given MMKGs, leveraging both structural information from the triples and multi-modal information of the entities.Existing MMKGC methods usually extract multi-modal features with pre-trained models and employ a fusion module to integrate multi-modal features with triple prediction.However, this often results in a coarse handling of multi-modal data, overlooking the nuanced, fine-grained semantic details and their interactions.To tackle this shortfall, we introduce a novel framework MyGO to process, fuse, and augment the fine-grained modality information from MMKGs.MyGO tokenizes multi-modal raw data as fine-grained discrete tokens and learns entity representations with a cross-modal entity encoder.To further augment the multi-modal representations, MyGO incorporates fine-grained contrastive learning to highlight the specificity of the entity representations.Experiments on standard MMKGC benchmarks reveal that our method surpasses 20 of the latest models, underlining its superior performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/MyGO <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the current artificial intelligence (AI) era, the scale and quality of the dataset play a crucial role in training a high-quality AI model.However, good data is not a free lunch and is always hard to access due to privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to that of the private dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Nevertheless, in some scenarios, it has been found that the attributes needed to train an AI model belong to different parties, and they cannot share the raw data for synthetic data publication due to privacy regulations.In PETS 2023, Xue et al. proposed the first generative adversary network-based model, VertiGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication.However, after thoroughly investigating, we found that VertiGAN is less effective in preserving the correlation among the attributes of different parties.This article proposes a Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network, VFLGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication to address the above issues.Our experimental results show that compared with VertiGAN, VFLGAN significantly improves the quality of synthetic data.Taking the MNIST dataset as an example, the quality of the synthetic dataset generated by VFLGAN is 3.2 times better than that generated by VertiGAN w.r.t.the Fr\'echet Distance.We also designed a more efficient and effective Gaussian mechanism for the proposed VFLGAN to provide the synthetic dataset with a differential privacy guarantee.On the other hand, differential privacy only gives the upper bound of the worst-case privacy guarantee.This article also proposes a practical auditing scheme that applies membership inference attacks to estimate privacy leakage through the synthetic dataset.</p>

                  <p>Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes in our daily lives, posing challenges characterized by monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass.Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction.To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering.We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span>We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering.We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices.Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures.This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality.Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Datasets are essential for training and testing vehicle perception algorithms.However, the collection and annotation of real-world images is time-consuming and expensive.Driving simulators offer a solution by automatically generating various driving scenarios with corresponding annotations, but the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap remains a challenge.While most of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) follows the de facto Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)-based methods, the recent emerging diffusion probabilistic models have not been fully explored in mitigating Sim2Real challenges for driving data synthesis.To explore the performance, this paper applied three different generative AI methods to leverage semantic label maps from a driving simulator as a bridge for the creation of realistic datasets.A comparative analysis of these methods is presented from the perspective of image quality and perception.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>New synthetic datasets, which include driving images and auto-generated high-quality annotations, are produced with low costs and high scene variability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>The experimental results show that although GAN-based methods are adept at generating high-quality images when provided with manually annotated labels, ControlNet produces synthetic datasets with fewer artefacts and more structural fidelity when using simulator-generated labels.This suggests that the diffusion-based approach may provide improved stability and an alternative method for addressing Sim2Real challenges.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents that accomplish complex computer tasks with minimal human interventions have the potential to transform human-computer interaction, significantly enhancing accessibility and productivity.However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability.To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications.Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation.Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants.While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge.Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable insights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, environment, baseline models, and data are publicly available at https://os-world.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open set recognition (OSR) is a critical aspect of machine learning, addressing the challenge of detecting novel classes during inference.Within the realm of deep learning, neural classifiers trained on a closed set of data typically struggle to identify novel classes, leading to erroneous predictions.To address this issue, various heuristic methods have been proposed, allowing models to express uncertainty by stating "I don't know."However, a gap in the literature remains, as there has been limited exploration of the underlying mechanisms of these methods.In this paper, we conduct an analysis of open set recognition methods, focusing on the aspect of feature diversity.Our research reveals a significant correlation between learning diverse discriminative features and enhancing OSR performance.Building on this insight, we propose a novel OSR approach that leverages the advantages of feature diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The efficacy of our method is substantiated through rigorous evaluation on a standard OSR testbench, demonstrating a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories.Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts.However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation.In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO).Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward.Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data.Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm.OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have revolutionized gene therapy, but their broad tropism and suboptimal transduction efficiency limit their clinical applications.To overcome these limitations, researchers have focused on designing and screening capsid libraries to identify improved vectors.However, the large sequence space and limited resources present challenges in identifying viable capsid variants.In this study, we propose an end-to-end diffusion model to generate capsid sequences with enhanced viability.Using publicly available AAV2 data, we generated 38,000 diverse AAV2 viral protein (VP) sequences, and evaluated 8,000 for viral selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results attested the superiority of our model compared to traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Additionally, in the absence of AAV9 capsid data, apart from one wild-type sequence, we used the same model to directly generate a number of viable sequences with up to 9 mutations.we transferred the remaining 30,000 samples to the AAV9 domain.Furthermore, we conducted mutagenesis on AAV9 VP hypervariable regions VI and V, contributing to the continuous improvement of the AAV9 VP sequence.This research represents a significant advancement in the design and functional validation of rAAV vectors, offering innovative solutions to enhance specificity and transduction efficiency in gene therapy applications.</p>

                  <p>Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target but usually requires simultaneous access to both source and target data.Moreover, UDA approaches commonly assume that source and target domains share the same labels space.Yet, these two assumptions are hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios.This paper considers the more challenging Source-Free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting, where both assumptions are dropped.We propose a novel approach for SF-OSDA that exploits the granularity of target-private categories by segregating their samples into multiple unknown classes.Starting from an initial clustering-based assignment, our method progressively improves the segregation of target-private samples by refining their pseudo-labels with the guide of an uncertainty-based sample selection module.Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive loss, named NL-InfoNCELoss, that, integrating negative learning into self-supervised contrastive learning, enhances the model robustness to noisy pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.88</span></span>Notably, additional analyses show that our method is able to learn the underlying semantics of novel classes, opening the possibility to perform novel class discovery.</p>

                  <p>A key challenge in contrastive learning is to generate negative samples from a large sample set to contrast with positive samples, for learning better encoding of the data.These negative samples often follow a softmax distribution which are dynamically updated during the training process.However, sampling from this distribution is non-trivial due to the high computational costs in computing the partition function.In this paper, we propose an Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo negative sampling method for Contrastive learning (EMC$^2$).We follow the global contrastive learning loss as introduced in SogCLR, and propose EMC$^2$ which utilizes an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings subroutine to generate hardness-aware negative samples in an online fashion during the optimization.We prove that EMC$^2$ finds an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$-stationary point of the global contrastive loss in $T$ iterations.Compared to prior works, EMC$^2$ is the first algorithm that exhibits global convergence (to stationarity) regardless of the choice of batch size while exhibiting low computation and memory cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments validate that EMC$^2$ is effective with small batch training and achieves comparable or better performance than baseline algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We report the results for pre-training image encoders on STL-10 and Imagenet-100.</p>

In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons.We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution.We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the problem we study is provably hard, we show empirically that our methods work well in practice, and we offer theoretical arguments to explain our performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Finally, we verify that the data we produce are "close" to the desired ground truth.</p>

                  <p>Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies.However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain.The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas.One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging.With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience.In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale.The merged results are compared with the widely used reanalysis precipitation product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), and assessed against gauge observational data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC).The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values.Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE.However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline batch inference is a common task in the industry for deep learning applications, but it can be challenging to ensure stability and performance when dealing with large amounts of data and complicated inference pipelines.This paper demonstrated AntBatchInfer, an elastic batch inference framework, which is specially optimized for the non-dedicated cluster.AntBatchInfer addresses these challenges by providing multi-level fault-tolerant capabilities, enabling the stable execution of versatile and long-running inference tasks.It also improves inference efficiency by pipelining, intra-node, and inter-node scaling.It further optimizes the performance in complicated multiple-model batch inference scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments and real-world statistics, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of stability and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the experiment, it outperforms the baseline by at least $2\times$ and $6\times$ in the single-model or multiple-model batch inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Also, it is widely used at Ant Group, with thousands of daily jobs from various scenarios, including DLRM, CV, and NLP, which proves its practicability in the industry.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a new research direction for online Multi-Level Aggregation (MLA) with delays.In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted rooted tree $T$, and we have to serve a sequence of requests arriving at its vertices in an online manner.Each request $r$ is characterized by two parameters: its arrival time $t(r)$ and location $l(r)$ (a vertex).Once a request $r$ arrives, we can either serve it immediately or postpone this action until any time $t > t(r)$. We can serve several pending requests at the same time, and the service cost of a service corresponds to the weight of the subtree that contains all the requests served and the root of $T$. Postponing the service of a request $r$ to time $t >t(r)$ generates an additional delay cost of $t - t(r)$. The goal is to serve all requests in an online manner such that the total cost (i.e., the total sum of service and delay costs) is minimized.The current best algorithm for this problem achieves a competitive ratio of $O(d^2)$ (Azar and Touitou, FOCS'19), where $d$ denotes the depth of the tree.   Here, we consider a stochastic version of MLA where the requests follow a Poisson arrival process.We present a deterministic online algorithm which achieves a constant ratio of expectations, meaning that the ratio between the expected costs of the solution generated by our algorithm and the optimal offline solution is bounded by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is obtained by carefully combining two strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>In the first one, we plan periodic oblivious visits to the subset of frequent vertices, whereas in the second one, we greedily serve the pending requests in the remaining vertices.This problem is complex enough to demonstrate a very rare phenomenon that ``single-minded" or ``sample-average" strategies are not enough in stochastic optimization.</p>

                  <p>One of the notorious issues for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is poor sample efficiency.Compared to single agent RL, the sample efficiency for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is more challenging because of its inherent partial observability, non-stationary training, and enormous strategy space.Although much effort has been devoted to developing new methods and enhancing sample efficiency, we look at the widely used episodic training mechanism.In each training step, tens of frames are collected, but only one gradient step is made.We argue that this episodic training could be a source of poor sample efficiency.To better exploit the data already collected, we propose to increase the frequency of the gradient updates per environment interaction (a.k.a. Replay Ratio or Update-To-Data ratio).To show its generality, we evaluate $3$ MARL methods on $6$ SMAC tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results validate that a higher replay ratio significantly improves the sample efficiency for MARL algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>The codes to reimplement the results presented in this paper are open-sourced at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rr_for_MARL-0D83/.</p>

                  <p>Recent research has shown that incorporating bug-related facts, such as stack traces and GitHub issues, into prompts enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs?To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark.Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial.Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM's performance on a given task instance.We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair.Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt.This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set.To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked Maniple against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods.On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, Maniple repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.</p>

                  <p>Automated Driving (AD) systems have the potential to increase safety, comfort and energy efficiency.Recently, major automotive companies have started testing and validating AD systems (ADS) on public roads.Nevertheless, the commercial deployment and wide adoption of ADS have been moderate, partially due to system functional insufficiencies (FI) that undermine passenger safety and lead to hazardous situations on the road.FIs are defined in ISO 21448 Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF).FIs are insufficiencies in sensors, actuators and algorithm implementations, including neural networks and probabilistic calculations.Examples of FIs in ADS include inaccurate ego-vehicle localization on the road, incorrect prediction of a cyclist maneuver, unreliable detection of a pedestrian, etc.   The main goal of our study is to formulate a generic architectural design pattern, which is compatible with existing methods and ADS, to improve FI mitigation and enable faster commercial deployment of ADS.First, we studied the 2021 autonomous vehicles disengagement reports published by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data clearly show that disengagements are five times more often caused by FIs rather than by system faults.We then made a comprehensive list of insufficiencies and their characteristics by analyzing over 10 hours of publicly available road test videos.In particular, we identified insufficiency types in four major categories: world model, motion plan, traffic rule, and operational design domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The insufficiency characterization helps making the SOTIF analyses of triggering conditions more systematic and comprehensive.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span>Based on our FI characterization, simulation experiments and literature survey, we define a novel generic architectural design pattern Daruma to dynamically select the channel that is least likely to have a FI at the moment.</p>

                  <p>In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic.LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly.Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations.To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries.   Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models.Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit element that may be critical for in-context learning -- the induction head (IH), which performs a match-and-copy operation.During training of large transformers on natural language data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phase change in the loss.Despite the robust evidence for IHs and this interesting coincidence with the phase change, relatively little is known about the diversity and emergence dynamics of IHs.Why is there more than one IH, and how are they dependent on each other?Why do IHs appear all of a sudden, and what are the subcircuits that enable them to emerge?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We answer these questions by studying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting by training on synthetic data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired causal framework for modifying activations throughout training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>Using this framework, we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs.By clamping subsets of activations throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuits that interact to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change.Furthermore, these subcircuits shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such as phase change timing, already showing the promise of this more in-depth understanding of subcircuits that need to "go right" for an induction head.</p>

                  <p>The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive.If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities.This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge.Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios.While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts.Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again.In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling.Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets.Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions.To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling.Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</p>

                  <p>As the concept of Industries 5.0 develops, industrial metaverses are expected to operate in parallel with the actual industrial processes to offer ``Human-Centric" Safe, Secure, Sustainable, Sensitive, Service, and Smartness ``6S" manufacturing solutions.Industrial metaverses not only visualize the process of productivity in a dynamic and evolutional way, but also provide an immersive laboratory experimental environment for optimizing and remodeling the process.Besides, the customized user needs that are hidden in social media data can be discovered by social computing technologies, which introduces an input channel for building the whole social manufacturing process including industrial metaverses.This makes the fusion of multi-source data cross Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) the foundational and key challenge.This work firstly proposes a multi-source-data-fusion-driven operational architecture for industrial metaverses on the basis of conducting a comprehensive literature review on the state-of-the-art multi-source data fusion methods.The advantages and disadvantages of each type of method are analyzed by considering the fusion mechanisms and application scenarios.Especially, we combine the strengths of deep learning and knowledge graphs in scalability and parallel computation to enable our proposed framework the ability of prescriptive optimization and evolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This integration can address the shortcomings of deep learning in terms of explainability and fact fabrication, as well as overcoming the incompleteness and the challenges of construction and maintenance inherent in knowledge graphs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated through a parallel weaving case study.In the end, we discuss the challenges and future directions of multi-source data fusion cross CPSS for industrial metaverses and social manufacturing in Industries 5.0.</p>

                  <p>A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA).In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems.The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy.This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills.With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty.Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems.Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.</p>

                  <p>In some situations, the interpretability of the machine learning models plays a role as important as the model accuracy.Interpretability comes from the need to trust the prediction model, verify some of its properties, or even enforce them to improve fairness.Many model-agnostic explanatory methods exists to provide explanations for black-box models.In the regression task, the practitioner can use white-boxes or gray-boxes models to achieve more interpretable results, which is the case of symbolic regression.When using an explanatory method, and since interpretability lacks a rigorous definition, there is a need to evaluate and compare the quality and different explainers.This paper proposes a benchmark scheme to evaluate explanatory methods to explain regression models, mainly symbolic regression models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments were performed using 100 physics equations with different interpretable and non-interpretable regression methods and popular explanation methods, evaluating the performance of the explainers performance with several explanation measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.593</span></span>In addition, we further analyzed four benchmarks from the GP community.The results have shown that Symbolic Regression models can be an interesting alternative to white-box and black-box models that is capable of returning accurate models with appropriate explanations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Regarding the explainers, we observed that Partial Effects and SHAP were the most robust explanation models, with Integrated Gradients being unstable only with tree-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>This benchmark is publicly available for further experiments.</p>

                  <p>Over the last year, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become widely available and have exhibited fairness issues similar to those in previous machine learning systems.Current research is primarily focused on analyzing and quantifying these biases in training data and their impact on the decisions of these models, alongside developing mitigation strategies.This research largely targets well-known biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and language.However, it is clear that LLMs are also affected by other, less obvious implicit biases.The complex and often opaque nature of these models makes detecting such biases challenging, yet this is crucial due to their potential negative impact in various applications.In this paper, we explore new avenues for detecting these unanticipated biases in LLMs, focusing specifically on Uncertainty Quantification and Explainable AI methods.These approaches aim to assess the certainty of model decisions and to make the internal decision-making processes of LLMs more transparent, thereby identifying and understanding biases that are not immediately apparent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through this research, we aim to contribute to the development of fairer and more transparent AI systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span></p>
