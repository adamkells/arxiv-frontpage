                  <p>Dataset distillation synthesizes a small dataset such that a model trained on this set approximates the performance of the original dataset.Recent studies on dataset distillation focused primarily on the design of the optimization process, with methods such as gradient matching, feature alignment, and training trajectory matching.However, little attention has been given to the issue of underutilized regions in synthetic images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose UDD, a novel approach to identify and exploit the underutilized regions to make them informative and discriminate, and thus improve the utilization of the synthetic dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.929</span></span>Technically, UDD involves two underutilized regions searching policies for different conditions, i.e., response-based policy and data jittering-based policy.Compared with previous works, such two policies are utilization-sensitive, equipping with the ability to dynamically adjust the underutilized regions during the training process.Additionally, we analyze the current model optimization problem and design a category-wise feature contrastive loss, which can enhance the distinguishability of different categories and alleviate the shortcomings of the existing multi-formation methods.Experimentally, our method improves the utilization of the synthetic dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.For example, the improvements on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are 4.0\% and 3.7\% over the next best method with IPC=1, by mining the underutilized regions.</p>

                  <p>Web forms are one of the primary ways to collect personal information online, yet they are relatively under-studied.Unlike web tracking, data collection through web forms is explicit and contextualized.Users (i) are asked to input specific personal information types, and (ii) know the specific context (i.e., on which website and for what purpose).For web forms to be trusted by users, they must meet the common sense standards of appropriate data collection practices within a particular context (i.e., privacy norms).In this paper, we extract the privacy norms embedded within web forms through a measurement study.First, we build a specialized crawler to discover web forms on websites.We run it on 11,500 popular websites, and we create a dataset of 293K web forms.Second, to process data of this scale, we develop a cost-efficient way to annotate web forms with form types and personal information types, using text classifiers trained with assistance of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, by analyzing the annotated dataset, we reveal common patterns of data collection practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span>We find that (i) these patterns are explained by functional necessities and legal obligations, thus reflecting privacy norms, and that (ii) deviations from the observed norms often signal unnecessary data collection.In addition, we analyze the privacy policies that accompany web forms.We show that, despite their wide adoption and use, there is a disconnect between privacy policy disclosures and the observed privacy norms.</p>

                  <p>Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information.Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR.Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition.These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions.Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability.Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity.For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features.We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information.To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</p>

                  <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions.Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors.This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon that can even change the way users perceive this song.In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation.PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics.This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones.We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using both publicly available listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from Deezer, a global music streaming service, confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices.This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength.For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment.Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.)for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.915</span></span>We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods.To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets.</p>

                  <p>Rapid advancements have been made in extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs).However, extending input modality of LLMs to video data remains a challenging endeavor, especially for long videos.Due to insufficient access to large-scale high-quality video data and the excessive compression of visual features, current methods exhibit limitations in effectively processing long videos.In this paper, we introduce Kangaroo, a powerful Video LMM aimed at addressing these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Confronted with issue of inadequate training data, we develop a data curation system to build a large-scale dataset with high-quality annotations for vision-language pre-training and instruction tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>In addition, we design a curriculum training pipeline with gradually increasing resolution and number of input frames to accommodate long videos.Evaluation results demonstrate that, with 8B parameters, Kangaroo achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of video understanding benchmarks while exhibiting competitive results on others.Particularly, on benchmarks specialized for long videos, Kangaroo excels some larger models with over 10B parameters and proprietary models.</p>

                  <p>As the field of artificial intelligence progresses, assistive technologies are becoming more widely used across all industries.The healthcare industry is no different, with numerous studies being done to develop assistive tools for healthcare professionals.Automatic diagnostic systems are one such beneficial tool that can assist with a variety of tasks, including collecting patient information, analyzing test results, and diagnosing patients.However, the idea of developing systems that can provide a differential diagnosis has been largely overlooked in most of these research studies.In this study, we propose a transformer-based approach for providing differential diagnoses based on a patient's age, sex, medical history, and symptoms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use the DDXPlus dataset, which provides differential diagnosis information for patients based on 49 disease types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Firstly, we propose a method to process the tabular patient data from the dataset and engineer them into patient reports to make them suitable for our research.In addition, we introduce two data modification modules to diversify the training data and consequently improve the robustness of the models.We approach the task as a multi-label classification problem and conduct extensive experiments using four transformer models.All the models displayed promising results by achieving over 97% F1 score on the held-out test set.Moreover, we design additional behavioral tests to get a broader understanding of the models.In particular, for one of our test cases, we prepared a custom test set of 100 samples with the assistance of a doctor.The results on the custom set showed that our proposed data modification modules improved the model's generalization capabilities.We hope our findings will provide future researchers with valuable insights and inspire them to develop reliable systems for automatic differential diagnosis.</p>

Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench.With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0.To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult.Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.   The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.</p>

                  <p>Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation.Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area.Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering.However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views.In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did.We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language.Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time.To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates.However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model.In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling.Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment.Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.</p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data.However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals.There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification.Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information.In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process.This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability.Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL).Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance.We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification.The code will be made available after publication.</p>

However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists.In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources.We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region.Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners.Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator.The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.Additional details along with the dataset links and codes are available at $\href{https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/cracks-crowdsourcing-resources-for-analysis-and-categorization-of-key-subsurface-faults/}{link}$.</p>

                  <p>Interpreting motion captured in image sequences is crucial for a wide range of computer vision applications.Typical estimation approaches include optical flow (OF), which approximates the apparent motion instantaneously in a scene, and multiple object tracking (MOT), which tracks the motion of subjects over time.Often, the motion of objects in a scene is governed by some underlying dynamical system which could be inferred by analyzing the motion of groups of objects.Standard motion analyses, however, are not designed to intuit flow dynamics from trajectory data, making such measurements difficult in practice.The goal of this work is to extend gradient-based dynamical systems analyses to real-world applications characterized by complex, feature-rich image sequences with imperfect tracers.The tracer trajectories are tracked using deep vision networks and gradients are approximated using Lagrangian gradient regression (LGR), a tool designed to estimate spatial gradients from sparse data.From gradients, dynamical features such as regions of coherent rotation and transport barriers are identified.The proposed approach is affordably implemented and enables advanced studies including the motion analysis of two distinct object classes in a single image sequence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two examples of the method are presented on data sets for which standard gradient-based analyses do not apply. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on spatio-temporal (ST) traffic prediction traffic using graph neural networks.Given that ST data consists of non-stationary and complex time events, interpreting and predicting such trends is comparatively complicated.Representation of ST data in modes helps us infer behavior and assess the impact of noise on prediction applications.We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into modes using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, which is then fed into the neural network for forecasting future states.This hybrid approach is known as a variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN).Instead of exhaustively searching for the number of modes, they are determined using the reconstruction loss from the real-time application data.We also study the significance of each mode and the impact of bandwidth constraints on different horizon predictions in traffic flow data.We evaluate the performance of our proposed network on the LargeST dataset for both short and long-term predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework yields better results compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>Holographic multiple-input and multiple-output (HMIMO) is a promising technology with the potential to achieve high energy and spectral efficiencies, enhance system capacity and diversity, etc.In this work, we address the challenge of HMIMO near field (NF) channel estimation, which is complicated by the intricate model introduced by the dyadic Green's function.Despite its complexity, the channel model is governed by a limited set of parameters.This makes parametric channel estimation highly attractive, offering substantial performance enhancements and enabling the extraction of valuable sensing parameters, such as user locations, which are particularly beneficial in mobile networks.However, the relationship between these parameters and channel gains is nonlinear and compounded by integration, making the estimation a formidable task.To tackle this problem, we propose a novel neural network (NN) assisted hybrid method.With the assistance of NNs, we first develop a novel hybrid channel model with a significantly simplified expression compared to the original one, thereby enabling parametric channel estimation.Using the readily available training data derived from the original channel model, the NNs in the hybrid channel model can be effectively trained offline.Then, building upon this hybrid channel model, we formulate the parametric channel estimation problem with a probabilistic framework and design a factor graph representation for Bayesian estimation.Leveraging the factor graph representation and unitary approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop an effective message passing-based Bayesian channel estimation algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>Over the past few years, the YOLO series of models has emerged as one of the dominant methodologies in the realm of object detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Many studies have advanced these baseline models by modifying their architectures, enhancing data quality, and developing new loss functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>However, current models still exhibit deficiencies in processing feature maps, such as overlooking the fusion of cross-scale features and a static fusion approach that lacks the capability for dynamic feature adjustment.To address these issues, this paper introduces an efficient Fine-grained Multi-scale Dynamic Selection Module (FMDS Module), which applies a more effective dynamic feature selection and fusion method on fine-grained multi-scale feature maps, significantly enhancing the detection accuracy of small, medium, and large-sized targets in complex environments.Furthermore, this paper proposes an Adaptive Gated Multi-branch Focus Fusion Module (AGMF Module), which utilizes multiple parallel branches to perform complementary fusion of various features captured by the gated unit branch, FMDS Module branch, and TripletAttention branch.This approach further enhances the comprehensiveness, diversity, and integrity of feature fusion.This paper has integrated the FMDS Module, AGMF Module, into Yolov9 to develop a novel object detection model named FA-YOLO.Extensive experimental results show that under identical experimental conditions, FA-YOLO achieves an outstanding 66.1% mean Average Precision (mAP) on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, representing 1.0% improvement over YOLOv9's 65.1%.Additionally, the detection accuracies of FA-YOLO for small, medium, and large targets are 44.1%, 54.6%, and 70.8%, respectively, showing improvements of 2.0%, 3.1%, and 0.9% compared to YOLOv9's 42.1%, 51.5%, and 69.9%.</p>

                  <p>Visual grounding aims to localize the object referred to in an image based on a natural language query.Although progress has been made recently, accurately localizing target objects within multiple-instance distractions (multiple objects of the same category as the target) remains a significant challenge.Existing methods demonstrate a significant performance drop when there are multiple distractions in an image, indicating an insufficient understanding of the fine-grained semantics and spatial relationships between objects.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Relation and Semantic-sensitive Visual Grounding (ResVG) model, to address this issue.Firstly, we enhance the model's understanding of fine-grained semantics by injecting semantic prior information derived from text queries into the model.This is achieved by leveraging text-to-image generation models to produce images representing the semantic attributes of target objects described in queries.Secondly, we tackle the lack of training samples with multiple distractions by introducing a relation-sensitive data augmentation method.This method generates additional training data by synthesizing images containing multiple objects of the same category and pseudo queries based on their spatial relationships.The proposed ReSVG model significantly improves the model's ability to comprehend both object semantics and spatial relations, leading to enhanced performance in visual grounding tasks, particularly in scenarios with multiple-instance distractions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our methods on five datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/ResVG.</p>

                  <p>Histopathological image analysis is crucial for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.While deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have advanced this field, their "black-box" nature raises concerns about interpretability and trustworthiness.Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques aim to address these concerns, but evaluating their effectiveness remains challenging.A significant issue with current occlusion-based XAI methods is that they often generate Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples, leading to inaccurate evaluations.In this paper, we introduce Inpainting-Based Occlusion (IBO), a novel occlusion strategy that utilizes a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model to inpaint occluded regions in histopathological images.By replacing cancerous areas with realistic, non-cancerous tissue, IBO minimizes OoD artifacts and preserves data integrity.We evaluate our method on the CAMELYON16 dataset through two phases: first, by assessing perceptual similarity using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric, and second, by quantifying the impact on model predictions through Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis.Our results demonstrate that IBO significantly improves perceptual fidelity, achieving nearly twice the improvement in LPIPS scores compared to the best existing occlusion strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, IBO increased the precision of XAI performance prediction from 42% to 71% compared to traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>These results demonstrate IBO's potential to provide more reliable evaluations of XAI techniques, benefiting histopathology and other applications.The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/a-fsh-r/IBO.</p>

                  <p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is the task of bridging the domain gap between a labeled source domain, e.g., synthetic data, and an unlabeled target domain.We observe that current UDA methods show inferior results on fine structures and tend to oversegment objects with ambiguous appearance.To address these shortcomings, we propose to leverage geometric information, i.e., depth predictions, as depth discontinuities often coincide with segmentation boundaries.We show that naively incorporating depth into current UDA methods does not fully exploit the potential of this complementary information.To this end, we present MICDrop, which learns a joint feature representation by masking image encoder features while inversely masking depth encoder features.With this simple yet effective complementary masking strategy, we enforce the use of both modalities when learning the joint feature representation.To aid this process, we propose a feature fusion module to improve both global as well as local information sharing while being robust to errors in the depth predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our method can be plugged into various recent UDA methods and consistently improve results across standard UDA benchmarks, obtaining new state-of-the-art performances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks.However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost.To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations.This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches.This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC).The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices.By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality.The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks.Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.The code is available on: https://github.com/farnooshar/EigenClusterVIS</p>

                  <p>Multimodal fusion, leveraging data like vision and language, is rapidly gaining traction.This enriched data representation improves performance across various tasks.Existing methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a critical area where AI models encounter unseen data in real-world scenarios, rely heavily on whole-image features.These image-level features can include irrelevant information that hinders the detection of OOD samples, ultimately limiting overall performance.In this paper, we propose \textbf{TagOOD}, a novel approach for OOD detection that leverages vision-language representations to achieve label-free object feature decoupling from whole images.This decomposition enables a more focused analysis of object semantics, enhancing OOD detection performance.Subsequently, TagOOD trains a lightweight network on the extracted object features to learn representative class centers.These centers capture the central tendencies of IND object classes, minimizing the influence of irrelevant image features during OOD detection.Finally, our approach efficiently detects OOD samples by calculating distance-based metrics as OOD scores between learned centers and test samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TagOOD on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing OOD detection methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>This work presents a novel perspective for further exploration of multimodal information utilization in OOD detection, with potential applications across various tasks.</p>

                  <p>Detecting out-of-distribution inputs for visual recognition models has become critical in safe deep learning.This paper proposes a novel hierarchical visual category modeling scheme to separate out-of-distribution data from in-distribution data through joint representation learning and statistical modeling.We learn a mixture of Gaussian models for each in-distribution category.There are many Gaussian mixture models to model different visual categories.With these Gaussian models, we design an in-distribution score function by aggregating multiple Mahalanobis-based metrics.We don't use any auxiliary outlier data as training samples, which may hurt the generalization ability of out-of-distribution detection algorithms.We split the ImageNet-1k dataset into ten folds randomly.We use one fold as the in-distribution dataset and the others as out-of-distribution datasets to evaluate the proposed method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also conduct experiments on seven popular benchmarks, including CIFAR, iNaturalist, SUN, Places, Textures, ImageNet-O, and OpenImage-O. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms clearly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Meanwhile, we find that our visual representation has a competitive performance when compared with features learned by classical methods.These results demonstrate that the proposed method hasn't weakened the discriminative ability of visual recognition models and keeps high efficiency in detecting out-of-distribution samples.</p>

                  <p>The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growth of service computing, while efficient service recommendation methods are desired to recommend high-quality services to users.It is well known that collaborative filtering is one of the most popular methods for service recommendation based on QoS, and many existing proposals focus on improving recommendation accuracy, i.e., recommending high-quality redundant services.Nevertheless, users may have different requirements on QoS, and hence diversified recommendation has been attracting increasing attention in recent years to fulfill users' diverse demands and to explore potential services.Unfortunately, the recommendation performances relies on a large volume of data (e.g., QoS data), whereas the data may be distributed across multiple platforms.Therefore, to enable data sharing across the different platforms for diversified service recommendation, we propose a Privacy-preserving Diversified Service Recommendation (PDSR) method.Specifically, we innovate in leveraging the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) mechanism such that privacy-preserved data sharing across different platforms is enabled to construct a service similarity graph.Based on the similarity graph, we propose a novel accuracy-diversity metric and design a $2$-approximation algorithm to select $K$ services to recommend by maximizing the accuracy-diversity measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on real datasets are conducted to verify the efficacy of our PDSR method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies investigated the challenge of assessing the strength of a given claim extracted from a dataset, particularly the claim's potential of being misleading and cherry-picked.We focus on claims that compare answers to an aggregate query posed on a view that selects tuples.The strength of a claim amounts to the question of how likely it is that the view is carefully chosen to support the claim, whereas less careful choices would lead to contradictory claims.We embark on the study of the reverse task that offers a complementary angle in the critical assessment of data-based claims: given a claim, find useful supporting views.The goal of this task is twofold.On the one hand, we aim to assist users in finding significant evidence of phenomena of interest.On the other hand, we wish to provide them with machinery to criticize or counter given claims by extracting evidence of opposing statements.   To be effective, the supporting sub-population should be significant and defined by a ``natural'' view.We discuss several measures of naturalness and propose ways of extracting the best views under each measure (and combinations thereof).The main challenge is the computational cost, as na\"ive search is infeasible.We devise anytime algorithms that deploy two main steps: (1) a preliminary construction of a ranked list of attribute combinations that are assessed using fast-to-compute features, and (2) an efficient search for the actual views based on each attribute combination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a thorough experimental study that shows the effectiveness of our algorithms in terms of quality and execution cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>We also present a user study to assess the usefulness of the naturalness measures.</p>

                  <p>Even in the era of large models, one of the well-known issues in continual learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, which is significantly challenging when the continual data stream exhibits a long-tailed distribution, termed as Long-Tailed Continual Learning (LTCL).Existing LTCL solutions generally require the label distribution of the data stream to achieve re-balance training.However, obtaining such prior information is often infeasible in real scenarios since the model should learn without pre-identifying the majority and minority classes.To this end, we propose a novel Prior-free Balanced Replay (PBR) framework to learn from long-tailed data stream with less forgetting.Concretely, motivated by our experimental finding that the minority classes are more likely to be forgotten due to the higher uncertainty, we newly design an uncertainty-guided reservoir sampling strategy to prioritize rehearsing minority data without using any prior information, which is based on the mutual dependence between the model and samples.Additionally, we incorporate two prior-free components to further reduce the forgetting issue: (1) Boundary constraint is to preserve uncertain boundary supporting samples for continually re-estimating task boundaries.(2) Prototype constraint is to maintain the consistency of learned class prototypes along with training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is evaluated on three standard long-tailed benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance to existing CL methods and previous SOTA LTCL approach in both task- and class-incremental learning settings, as well as ordered- and shuffled-LTCL settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address issues of overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in the paradigm of self-supervised learning.Mainstream methods based on PEFT involve adding a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained parameters of the backbone fixed.These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone.Despite its success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization.We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity.Motivated by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework based on Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP).The target parameters refer to the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning.TPP includes an additional stage before PEFT to pre-train these target parameters.During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the target parameters are trainable.A defined pre-text task is used to encourage the target parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data.When PEFT is subsequently employed, the pre-trained target parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency.The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing for the integration of various pretext tasks for pre-training and supporting different PEFT methods as backbones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated the fine-tining performance of our method using five public datasets, including three modalities and two task types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>The results demonstrate that the proposed TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance.</p>

In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance.First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation.Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout.Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN.This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts.Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p>

                  <p>Causality is vital for understanding true cause-and-effect relationships between variables within predictive models, rather than relying on mere correlations, making it highly relevant in the field of Explainable AI.In an automated decision-making scenario, causal inference methods can analyze the underlying data-generation process, enabling explanations of a model's decision by manipulating features and creating counterfactual examples.These counterfactuals explore hypothetical scenarios where a minimal number of factors are altered, providing end-users with valuable information on how to change their situation.However, interpreting a set of multiple counterfactuals can be challenging for end-users who are not used to analyzing raw data records.In our work, we propose a novel multi-step pipeline that uses counterfactuals to generate natural language explanations of actions that will lead to a change in outcome in classifiers of tabular data using LLMs.This pipeline is designed to guide the LLM through smaller tasks that mimic human reasoning when explaining a decision based on counterfactual cases.We conducted various experiments using a public dataset and proposed a method of closed-loop evaluation to assess the coherence of the final explanation with the counterfactuals, as well as the quality of the content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results are promising, although further experiments with other datasets and human evaluations should be carried out. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate a variant of the classical stochastic Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problem, where the payoff received by an agent (either cost or reward) is both delayed, and directly corresponds to the magnitude of the delay.This setting models faithfully many real world scenarios such as the time it takes for a data packet to traverse a network given a choice of route (where delay serves as the agent's cost); or a user's time spent on a web page given a choice of content (where delay serves as the agent's reward).   Our main contributions are tight upper and lower bounds for both the cost and reward settings.For the case that delays serve as costs, which we are the first to consider, we prove optimal regret that scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\logT}{\Delta_i} + d^*$, where $T$ is the maximal number of steps, $\Delta_i$ are the sub-optimality gaps and $d^*$ is the minimal expected delay amongst arms.For the case that delays serves as rewards, we show optimal regret of $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + \bar{d}$, where $\bar d$ is the second maximal expected delay.These improve over the regret in the general delay-dependent payoff setting, which scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + D$, where $D$ is the maximum possible delay.Our regret bounds highlight the difference between the cost and reward scenarios, showing that the improvement in the cost scenario is more significant than for the reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we accompany our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level.Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information.Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR.Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition.These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions.Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability.Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity.For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data.We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</p>

                  <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs.In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition.It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country.Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches.These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs.To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used.These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.</p>

                  <p>Recently many deep learning models have been proposed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF).Based on previous literature, we identify three critical patterns that can improve forecasting accuracy: the order and semantic dependencies in time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency.However, little effort has been made to simultaneously consider order and semantic dependencies when developing forecasting models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing approaches utilize cross-variate dependency by mixing information from different timestamps and variates, which may introduce irrelevant or harmful cross-variate information to the time dimension and largely hinder forecasting performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>To overcome these limitations, we investigate the potential of Mamba for LTSF and discover two key advantages benefiting forecasting: (i) the selection mechanism makes Mamba focus on or ignore specific inputs and learn semantic dependency easily, and (ii) Mamba preserves order dependency by processing sequences recursively.After that, we empirically find that the non-linear activation used in Mamba is unnecessary for semantically sparse time series data.Therefore, we further propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding.Specifically, we first remove the non-linearities of Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF.Furthermore, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with cross-variate dependency modeling capabilities while reducing the interference between time and variate dimensions.Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a new distillation method for extracting knowledge from Large Foundation Models (LFM) into lightweight models, introducing a novel supervision mode that does not require manually annotated data.While LFMs exhibit exceptional zero-shot classification abilities across datasets, relying solely on LFM-generated embeddings for distillation poses two main challenges: LFM's task-irrelevant knowledge and the high density of features.The transfer of task-irrelevant knowledge could compromise the student model's discriminative capabilities, and the high density of features within target domains obstructs the extraction of discriminative knowledge essential for the task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we introduce the Proxy Relational Graph (PRG) method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We initially extract task-relevant knowledge from LFMs by calculating a weighted average of logits obtained through text prompt embeddings.Then we construct sample-class proxy graphs for LFM and student models, respectively, to model the correlation between samples and class proxies.Then, we achieve the distillation of selective knowledge by aligning the relational graphs produced by both the LFM and the student model.Specifically, the distillation from LFM to the student model is achieved through two types of alignment: 1) aligning the sample nodes produced by the student model with those produced by the LFM, and 2) aligning the edge relationships in the student model's graph with those in the LFM's graph.Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of PRG, demonstrating its ability to leverage the extensive knowledge base of LFMs while skillfully circumventing their inherent limitations in focused learning scenarios.Notably, in our annotation-free framework, PRG achieves an accuracy of 76.23\% (T: 77.9\%) on CIFAR-100 and 72.44\% (T: 75.3\%) on the ImageNet-1K.</p>

                  <p>Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices.This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength.For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment.Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.)for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks.To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community.We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

                  <p>Soft-tissue and bone tumours (STBT) are rare, diagnostically challenging lesions with variable clinical behaviours and treatment approaches.This systematic review provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using radiological imaging for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumours, highlighting challenges in clinical translation, and evaluating study alignment with the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) and the FUTURE-AI international consensus guidelines for trustworthy and deployable AI to promote the clinical translation of AI methods.The review covered literature from several bibliographic databases, including papers published before 17/07/2024.Original research in peer-reviewed journals focused on radiology-based AI for diagnosing or prognosing primary STBT was included.Exclusion criteria were animal, cadaveric, or laboratory studies, and non-English papers.Abstracts were screened by two of three independent reviewers for eligibility.Eligible papers were assessed against guidelines by one of three independent reviewers.The search identified 15,015 abstracts, from which 325 articles were included for evaluation.Most studies performed moderately on CLAIM, averaging a score of 28.9$\pm$7.5 out of 53, but poorly on FUTURE-AI, averaging 5.1$\pm$2.1 out of 30.Imaging-AI tools for STBT remain at the proof-of-concept stage, indicating significant room for improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Future efforts by AI developers should focus on design (e.g. define unmet clinical need, intended clinical setting and how AI would be integrated in clinical workflow), development (e.g. build on previous work, explainability), evaluation (e.g. evaluating and addressing biases, evaluating AI against best practices), and data reproducibility and availability (making documented code and data publicly available). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>Following these recommendations could improve clinical translation of AI methods.</p>

                  <p>As the demand for lithium-ion batteries rapidly increases there is a need to design these cells in a safe manner to mitigate thermal runaway.Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern.Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics.Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data.The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models.Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.</p>

                  <p>Human intelligence is characterized by our ability to absorb and apply knowledge from the world around us, especially in rapidly acquiring new concepts from minimal examples, underpinned by prior knowledge.Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to mimic this capacity by enabling significant generalizations and transferability.However, traditional FSL frameworks often rely on assumptions of clean, complete, and static data, conditions that are seldom met in real-world environments.Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world.This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings.We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions.Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.In conclusion, we outline potential future research directions for this evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is our hope that this review will catalyze further development of effective solutions to these complex challenges, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>The artificial intelligence (AI) world is running out of real data for training increasingly large generative models, resulting in accelerating pressure to train on synthetic data.Unfortunately, training new generative models with synthetic data from current or past generation models creates an autophagous (self-consuming) loop that degrades the quality and/or diversity of the synthetic data in what has been termed model autophagy disorder (MAD) and model collapse.Current thinking around model autophagy recommends that synthetic data is to be avoided for model training lest the system deteriorate into MADness.In this paper, we take a different tack that treats synthetic data differently from real data.Self-IMproving diffusion models with Synthetic data (SIMS) is a new training concept for diffusion models that uses self-synthesized data to provide negative guidance during the generation process to steer a model's generative process away from the non-ideal synthetic data manifold and towards the real data distribution.We demonstrate that SIMS is capable of self-improvement; it establishes new records based on the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) metric for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64 generation and achieves competitive results on FFHQ-64 and ImageNet-512.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, SIMS is, to the best of our knowledge, the first prophylactic generative AI algorithm that can be iteratively trained on self-generated synthetic data without going MAD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>As a bonus, SIMS can adjust a diffusion model's synthetic data distribution to match any desired in-domain target distribution to help mitigate biases and ensure fairness.</p>

In this paper, we design and implement CooTest, the first automated testing tool of the V2X-oriented cooperative perception module.CooTest devises the V2X-specific metamorphic relation and equips communication and weather transformation operators that can reflect the impact of the various cooperative driving factors to produce transformed scenes.Furthermore, we adopt a V2X-oriented guidance strategy for the transformed scene generation process and improve testing efficiency.We experiment CooTest with multiple cooperative perception models with different fusion schemes to evaluate its performance on different tasks.The experiment results show that CooTest can effectively detect erroneous behaviors under various V2X-oriented driving conditions.Also, the results confirm that CooTest can improve detection average precision and decrease misleading cooperation errors by retraining with the generated scenes.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Causality is vital for understanding true cause-and-effect relationships between variables within predictive models, rather than relying on mere correlations, making it highly relevant in the field of Explainable AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>In an automated decision-making scenario, causal inference methods can analyze the underlying data-generation process, enabling explanations of a model's decision by manipulating features and creating counterfactual examples.These counterfactuals explore hypothetical scenarios where a minimal number of factors are altered, providing end-users with valuable information on how to change their situation.However, interpreting a set of multiple counterfactuals can be challenging for end-users who are not used to analyzing raw data records.In our work, we propose a novel multi-step pipeline that uses counterfactuals to generate natural language explanations of actions that will lead to a change in outcome in classifiers of tabular data using LLMs.This pipeline is designed to guide the LLM through smaller tasks that mimic human reasoning when explaining a decision based on counterfactual cases.We conducted various experiments using a public dataset and proposed a method of closed-loop evaluation to assess the coherence of the final explanation with the counterfactuals, as well as the quality of the content.Results are promising, although further experiments with other datasets and human evaluations should be carried out.</p>
