                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various machine learning (ML) tasks.Given the high costs of creating annotated datasets for supervised learning, LLMs offer a valuable alternative by enabling effective few-shot in-context learning.However, these models can produce hallucinations, particularly in domains with incomplete knowledge.Additionally, current methods for knowledge distillation using LLMs often struggle to enhance the effectiveness of both teacher and student models.To address these challenges, we introduce DualChecker, an innovative framework designed to mitigate hallucinations and improve the performance of both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation.DualChecker employs ContextAligner to ensure that the context provided by teacher models aligns with human labeling standards.It also features a dynamic checker system that enhances model interaction: one component re-prompts teacher models with more detailed content when they show low confidence, and another identifies borderline cases from student models to refine the teaching templates.This interactive process promotes continuous improvement and effective knowledge transfer between the models.We evaluate DualChecker using a green innovation textual dataset that includes binary, multiclass, and token classification tasks.The experimental results show that DualChecker significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 17% improvement in F1 score for teacher models and 10% for student models.Notably, student models fine-tuned with LLM predictions perform comparably to those fine-tuned with actual data, even in a challenging domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make all datasets, models, and code from this research publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is critical in surveillance systems and patrol robots by identifying anomalous regions in images for early warning.Depending on whether reference data are utilized, anomaly detection can be categorized into anomaly detection with reference and anomaly detection without reference.Currently, anomaly detection without reference, which is closely related to out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection, struggles with learning anomalous patterns due to the difficulty of collecting sufficiently large and diverse anomaly datasets with the inherent rarity and novelty of anomalies.Alternatively, anomaly detection with reference employs the scheme of change detection to identify anomalies by comparing semantic changes between a reference image and a query one.However, there are very few ADr works due to the scarcity of public datasets in this domain.In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing the UMAD Benchmark Dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our best knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset designed specifically for anomaly detection with reference in robotic patrolling scenarios, e.g., where an autonomous robot is employed to detect anomalous objects by comparing a reference and a query video sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>The reference sequences can be taken by the robot along a specified route when there are no anomalous objects in the scene.The query sequences are captured online by the robot when it is patrolling in the same scene following the same route.Our benchmark dataset is elaborated such that each query image can find a corresponding reference based on accurate robot localization along the same route in the prebuilt 3D map, with which the reference and query images can be geometrically aligned using adaptive warping.Besides the proposed benchmark dataset, we evaluate the baseline models of ADr on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>We study a new problem setting of question answering (QA), referred to as DocTabQA.Within this setting, given a long document, the goal is to respond to questions by organizing the answers into structured tables derived directly from the document's content.Unlike traditional QA approaches which predominantly rely on unstructured text to formulate responses, DocTabQA aims to leverage structured tables as answers to convey information clearly and systematically, thereby enhancing user comprehension and highlighting relationships between data points.To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce the QTabA dataset, encompassing 300 financial documents, accompanied by manually annotated 1.5k question-table pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.875</span></span>Initially, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to establish a baseline.However, it is widely acknowledged that LLMs encounter difficulties when tasked with generating intricate, structured outputs from long input sequences.To overcome these challenges, we present a two-stage framework, called DocTabTalk, which initially retrieves relevant sentences from extensive documents and subsequently generates hierarchical tables based on these identified sentences.DocTabTalk incorporates two key technological innovations: AlignLLaMA and TabTalk, which are specifically tailored to assist GPT-4 in tackling DocTabQA, enabling it to generate well-structured, hierarchical tables with improved organization and clarity.Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on both QTabA and RotoWire datasets demonstrate that our DocTabTalk significantly enhances the performances of the GPT-4 in our proposed DocTabQA task and the table generation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/SmileWHC/DocTabQA for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.93</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Breast ultrasound is prominently used in diagnosing breast tumors.At present, many automatic systems based on deep learning have been developed to help radiologists in diagnosis.However, training such systems remains challenging because they are usually data-hungry and demand amounts of labeled data, which need professional knowledge and are expensive.Methods: We adopted a triplet network and a self-supervised contrastive learning technique to learn representations from unlabeled breast ultrasound video clips.We further designed a new hard triplet loss to to learn representations that particularly discriminate positive and negative image pairs that are hard to recognize.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also constructed a pretraining dataset from breast ultrasound videos (1,360 videos from 200 patients), which includes an anchor sample dataset with 11,805 images, a positive sample dataset with 188,880 images, and a negative sample dataset dynamically generated from video clips. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we constructed a finetuning dataset, including 400 images from 66 patients. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span>We transferred the pretrained network to a downstream benign/malignant classification task and compared the performance with other state-of-the-art models, including three models pretrained on ImageNet and a previous contrastive learning model retrained on our datasets.Results and conclusion: Experiments revealed that our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.952, which is significantly higher than the others.Further, we assessed the dependence of our pretrained model on the number of labeled data and revealed that <100 samples were required to achieve an AUC of 0.901.The proposed framework greatly reduces the demand for labeled data and holds potential for use in automatic breast ultrasound image diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>The Bengali language is the 5th most spoken native and 7th most spoken language in the world, and Bengali handwritten character recognition has attracted researchers for decades.However, other languages such as English, Arabic, Turkey, and Chinese character recognition have contributed significantly to developing handwriting recognition systems.Still, little research has been done on Bengali character recognition because of the similarity of the character, curvature and other complexities.However, many researchers have used traditional machine learning and deep learning models to conduct Bengali hand-written recognition.The study employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with ensemble transfer learning and a multichannel attention network.We generated the feature from the two branches of the CNN, including Inception Net and ResNet and then produced an ensemble feature fusion by concatenating them.After that, we applied the attention module to produce the contextual information from the ensemble features.Finally, we applied a classification module to refine the features and classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated the proposed model using the CAMTERdb 3.1.2 data set and achieved 92\% accuracy for the raw dataset and 98.00\% for the preprocessed dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>We believe that our contribution to the Bengali handwritten character recognition domain will be considered a great development.</p>

However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists.In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources.We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region.Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners.Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator.The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.Additional details along with the dataset links and codes are available at $\href{https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/cracks-crowdsourcing-resources-for-analysis-and-categorization-of-key-subsurface-faults/}{link}$.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we firstly tackle a more realistic Domain Adaptation (DA) setting: Source-Free Blending-Target Domain Adaptation (SF-BTDA), where we can not access to source domain data while facing mixed multiple target domains without any domain labels in prior.Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the co-existence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudo labels generated from the source model.In this paper, we propose a new method called Evidential Contrastive Alignment (ECA) to decouple the blending target domain and alleviate the effect from noisy target pseudo labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of a same class in the blended target domains, which alleviates the co-existence of different label shifts in blended targets.We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets and ECA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.</p>

                  <p>Merging models becomes a fundamental procedure in some applications that consider model efficiency and robustness.The training randomness or Non-I.I.D. data poses a huge challenge for averaging-based model fusion.Previous research efforts focus on element-wise regularization or neural permutations to enhance model averaging while overlooking weight scope variations among models, which can significantly affect merging effectiveness.In this paper, we reveal variations in weight scope under different training conditions, shedding light on its influence on model merging.Fortunately, the parameters in each layer basically follow the Gaussian distribution, which inspires a novel and simple regularization approach named Weight Scope Alignment (WSA).It contains two key components: 1) leveraging a target weight scope to guide the model training process for ensuring weight scope matching in the subsequent model merging.2) fusing the weight scope of two or more models into a unified one for multi-stage model fusion.We extend the WSA regularization to two different scenarios, including Mode Connectivity and Federated Learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Abundant experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>Forecasting the behaviour of complex dynamical systems such as interconnected sensor networks characterized by high-dimensional multivariate time series(MTS) is of paramount importance for making informed decisions and planning for the future in a broad spectrum of applications.Graph forecasting networks(GFNs) are well-suited for forecasting MTS data that exhibit spatio-temporal dependencies.However, most prior works of GFN-based methods on MTS forecasting rely on domain-expertise to model the nonlinear dynamics of the system, but neglect the potential to leverage the inherent relational-structural dependencies among time series variables underlying MTS data.On the other hand, contemporary works attempt to infer the relational structure of the complex dependencies between the variables and simultaneously learn the nonlinear dynamics of the interconnected system but neglect the possibility of incorporating domain-specific prior knowledge to improve forecast accuracy.To this end, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines explicit prior knowledge with implicit knowledge of the relational structure within the MTS data.It jointly learns intra-series temporal dependencies and inter-series spatial dependencies by encoding time-conditioned structural spatio-temporal inductive biases to provide more accurate and reliable forecasts.It also models the time-varying uncertainty of the multi-horizon forecasts to support decision-making by providing estimates of prediction uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed architecture has shown promising results on multiple benchmark datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods by a significant margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We report and discuss the ablation studies to validate our forecasting architecture.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender.In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs.However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases.To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs.To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity.Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs.Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%.By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs.More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.</p>

Following this framework, we make progress on numerous problems:   1) Online Stochastic Matching: We improve the state-of-the-art $0.666$ competitive ratio for unweighted/vertex-weighted matching to $0.69$.   2) Query-Commit Matching: We enhance the ratio to $0.705$ in the Query-Commit model, improving the best previous $0.696$ and $0.662$ for unweighted and vertex-weighted matching.   3) Stochastic AdWords: We give a $0.6338$ competitive algorithm, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier and answering a decade-old open question.   4) AdWords: The framework applies to the adversarial model if the rounding is oblivious to future items' distributions.We get the first multi-way OCS for AdWords, addressing an open question about OCS.This gives a $0.504$ competitive ratio for AdWords, improving the previous $0.501$.   5) Stochastic Display Ads: We design a $0.644$ competitive algorithm, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier.</p>

                  <p>Advancing the capabilities of earthquake nowcasting, the real-time forecasting of seismic activities remains a crucial and enduring objective aimed at reducing casualties.This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets.Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures.These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies.This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder.We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024.Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data.The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection.However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams.In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.</p>

FedMoE is composed of two fine-tuning stages.In the first stage, FedMoE simplifies the problem by conducting a heuristic search based on observed activation patterns, which identifies a suboptimal submodel for each client.In the second stage, these submodels are distributed to clients for further training and returned for server aggregating through a novel modular aggregation strategy.Meanwhile, FedMoE progressively adjusts the submodels to optimal through global expert recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous personalized FL methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>In cross-silo federated learning (FL), companies collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing heterogeneous data.Prior related work focused on algorithm development to tackle data heterogeneity.However, the dual problem of coopetition, i.e., FL collaboration and market competition, remains under-explored.This paper studies the FL coopetition using a dynamic two-period game model.In period 1, an incumbent company trains a local model and provides model-based services at a chosen price to users.In period 2, an entrant company enters, and both companies decide whether to engage in FL collaboration and then compete in selling model-based services at different prices to users.Analyzing the two-period game is challenging due to data heterogeneity, and that the incumbent's period one pricing has a temporal impact on coopetition in period 2, resulting in a non-concave problem.To address this issue, we decompose the problem into several concave sub-problems and develop an algorithm that achieves a global optimum.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results on three public datasets show two interesting insights. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>First, FL training brings model performance gain as well as competition loss, and collaboration occurs only when the performance gain outweighs the loss.Second, data heterogeneity can incentivize the incumbent to limit market penetration in period 1 and promote price competition in period 2.</p>

We consider, as performance metrics, the competitive ratio, which compares multiplicatively the cost of the solution to the tree of least cost among all scenarios, as well as the regret, which induces a similar, but additive comparison.For BSTs, we show that the problem is NP-hard across both metrics.We also show how to obtain a tree of competitive ratio $\lceil \log_2(k+1) \rceil$, and we prove that this ratio is optimal.For Huffman Trees, we show that the problem is, likewise, NP-hard across both metrics; we also give an algorithm of regret $\lceil \log_2 k \rceil$, which we show is near-optimal, by proving a lower bound of $\lfloor \log_2 k \rfloor$. Last, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing Pareto-optimal BSTs with respect to their regret, assuming scenarios defined by uniform distributions over the keys.This setting captures, in particular, the first study of fairness in the context of data structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide an experimental evaluation of all algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>To this end, we also provide mixed integer linear program formulation for computing optimal trees.</p>

                  <p>Whole-body CT is used for multi-trauma patients in the search of any and all injuries.Since an initial assessment needs to be rapid and the search for lesions is done for the whole body, very little time can be allocated for the inspection of a specific anatomy.In particular, intracranial hemorrhages are still missed, especially by clinical students.In this work, we present a Deep Learning approach for highlighting such lesions to improve the diagnostic accuracy.While most works on intracranial hemorrhages perform segmentation, detection only requires bounding boxes for the localization of the bleeding.In this paper, we propose a novel Voxel-Complete IoU (VC-IoU) loss that encourages the network to learn the 3D aspect ratios of bounding boxes and leads to more precise detections.We extensively experiment on brain bleeding detection using a publicly available dataset, and validate it on a private cohort, where we achieve 0.877 AR30, 0.728 AP30, and 0.653 AR30, 0.514 AP30 respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results constitute a relative +5% improvement in Average Recall for both datasets compared to other loss functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Finally, as there is little data currently publicly available for 3D object detection and as annotation resources are limited in the clinical setting, we evaluate the cost of different annotation methods, as well as the impact of imprecise bounding boxes in the training data on the detection performance.</p>

                  <p>Novelty detection is a critical task for deploying machine learning models in the open world.A crucial property of novelty detection methods is universality, which can be interpreted as generalization across various distributions of training or test data.More precisely, for novelty detection, distribution shifts may occur in the training set or the test set.Shifts in the training set refer to cases where we train a novelty detector on a new dataset and expect strong transferability.Conversely, distribution shifts in the test set indicate the methods' performance when the trained model encounters a shifted test sample.We experimentally show that existing methods falter in maintaining universality, which stems from their rigid inductive biases.Motivated by this, we aim for more generalized techniques that have more adaptable inductive biases.In this context, we leverage the fact that contrastive learning provides an efficient framework to easily switch and adapt to new inductive biases through the proper choice of augmentations in forming the negative pairs.We propose a novel probabilistic auto-negative pair generation method AutoAugOOD, along with contrastive learning, to yield a universal novelty detector method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method under different distribution shifts in various image benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Notably, our method emerges universality in the lens of adaptability to different setups of novelty detection, including one-class, unlabeled multi-class, and labeled multi-class settings.Code: https://github.com/mojtaba-nafez/UNODE</p>

The proposed U-Net architecture with CNN layers mimics a classical finite element multigrid algorithm.It can be shown that the CNN efficiently approximates all operations required by the solver, including the evaluation of the residual-based error estimator.In the CNN, a culling mask set-up according to the local corrections due to refinement on each mesh level reduces the overall complexity, allowing the network optimization with localized fine-scale finite element data.

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level.Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>Recently many deep learning models have been proposed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF).Based on previous literature, we identify three critical patterns that can improve forecasting accuracy: the order and semantic dependencies in time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency.However, little effort has been made to simultaneously consider order and semantic dependencies when developing forecasting models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing approaches utilize cross-variate dependency by mixing information from different timestamps and variates, which may introduce irrelevant or harmful cross-variate information to the time dimension and largely hinder forecasting performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>To overcome these limitations, we investigate the potential of Mamba for LTSF and discover two key advantages benefiting forecasting: (i) the selection mechanism makes Mamba focus on or ignore specific inputs and learn semantic dependency easily, and (ii) Mamba preserves order dependency by processing sequences recursively.After that, we empirically find that the non-linear activation used in Mamba is unnecessary for semantically sparse time series data.Therefore, we further propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding.Specifically, we first remove the non-linearities of Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF.Furthermore, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with cross-variate dependency modeling capabilities while reducing the interference between time and variate dimensions.Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a new distillation method for extracting knowledge from Large Foundation Models (LFM) into lightweight models, introducing a novel supervision mode that does not require manually annotated data.While LFMs exhibit exceptional zero-shot classification abilities across datasets, relying solely on LFM-generated embeddings for distillation poses two main challenges: LFM's task-irrelevant knowledge and the high density of features.The transfer of task-irrelevant knowledge could compromise the student model's discriminative capabilities, and the high density of features within target domains obstructs the extraction of discriminative knowledge essential for the task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we introduce the Proxy Relational Graph (PRG) method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We initially extract task-relevant knowledge from LFMs by calculating a weighted average of logits obtained through text prompt embeddings.Then we construct sample-class proxy graphs for LFM and student models, respectively, to model the correlation between samples and class proxies.Then, we achieve the distillation of selective knowledge by aligning the relational graphs produced by both the LFM and the student model.Specifically, the distillation from LFM to the student model is achieved through two types of alignment: 1) aligning the sample nodes produced by the student model with those produced by the LFM, and 2) aligning the edge relationships in the student model's graph with those in the LFM's graph.Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of PRG, demonstrating its ability to leverage the extensive knowledge base of LFMs while skillfully circumventing their inherent limitations in focused learning scenarios.Notably, in our annotation-free framework, PRG achieves an accuracy of 76.23\% (T: 77.9\%) on CIFAR-100 and 72.44\% (T: 75.3\%) on the ImageNet-1K.</p>

                  <p>LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) demonstrates outstanding accuracy and stability in general low-speed and smooth motion scenarios.However, in high-speed and intense motion scenarios, such as sharp turns, two primary challenges arise: firstly, due to the limitations of IMU frequency, the error in estimating significantly non-linear motion states escalates; secondly, drastic changes in the Field of View (FOV) may diminish the spatial overlap between LiDAR frame and pointcloud map (or between frames), leading to insufficient data association and constraint degradation.   To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive Sliding window LIO framework (AS-LIO) guided by the Spatial Overlap Degree (SOD).Initially, we assess the SOD between the LiDAR frames and the registered map, directly evaluating the adverse impact of current FOV variation on pointcloud alignment.Subsequently, we design an adaptive sliding window to manage the continuous LiDAR stream and control state updates, dynamically adjusting the update step according to the SOD.This strategy enables our odometry to adaptively adopt higher update frequency to precisely characterize trajectory during aggressive FOV variation, thus effectively reducing the non-linear error in positioning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, the historical constraints within the sliding window reinforce the frame-to-map data association, ensuring the robustness of state estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Experiments show that our AS-LIO framework can quickly perceive and respond to challenging FOV change, outperforming other state-of-the-art LIO frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p>

                  <p>Recent ethnographic research reveals that gang dynamics in Chicago's Southside have evolved with decentralized micro-gang "set" factions and cross-gang interpersonal networks marking the contemporary landscape.However, standard police datasets lack the depth to analyze gang violence with such granularity.To address this, we employed a natural language processing strategy to analyze text from a Chicago gangs message board.By identifying proper nouns, probabilistically linking them to gang sets, and assuming social connections among names mentioned together, we created a social network dataset of 271 individuals across 11 gang sets.Using Louvain community detection, we found that these individuals often connect with gang-affiliated peers from various gang sets that are physically proximal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that individuals with ties to homicide victims and central positions in the overall gang network were at increased risk of victimization, regardless of gang affiliation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>This research demonstrates that utilizing crowd-sourced information online can enable the study of otherwise inaccessible topics and populations.</p>

                  <p>Extreme Classification (XC) aims to map a query to the most relevant documents from a very large document set.XC algorithms used in real-world applications learn this mapping from datasets curated from implicit feedback, such as user clicks.However, these datasets inevitably suffer from missing labels.In this work, we observe that systematic missing labels lead to missing knowledge, which is critical for accurately modelling relevance between queries and documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We formally show that this absence of knowledge cannot be recovered using existing methods such as propensity weighting and data imputation strategies that solely rely on the training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>While LLMs provide an attractive solution to augment the missing knowledge, leveraging them in applications with low latency requirements and large document sets is challenging.To incorporate missing knowledge at scale, we propose SKIM (Scalable Knowledge Infusion for Missing Labels), an algorithm that leverages a combination of small LM and abundant unstructured meta-data to effectively mitigate the missing label problem.We show the efficacy of our method on large-scale public datasets through exhaustive unbiased evaluation ranging from human annotations to simulations inspired from industrial settings.SKIM outperforms existing methods on Recall@100 by more than 10 absolute points.Additionally, SKIM scales to proprietary query-ad retrieval datasets containing 10 million documents, outperforming contemporary methods by 12% in offline evaluation and increased ad click-yield by 1.23% in an online A/B test conducted on a popular search engine.We release our code, prompts, trained XC models and finetuned SLMs at: https://github.com/bicycleman15/skim</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been increasingly investigated for dynamic HVAC control in buildings.However, most studies focus on exploring solutions in online or off-policy scenarios without discussing in detail the implementation feasibility or effectiveness of dealing with purely offline datasets or trajectories.The lack of these works limits the real-world deployment of RL-based HVAC controllers, especially considering the abundance of historical data.To this end, this paper comprehensively evaluates the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by conducting analytical and numerical studies.The analysis is conducted from two perspectives: algorithms and dataset characteristics.As a prerequisite, the necessity of applying offline RL algorithms is first confirmed in two building environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The ability of observation history modeling to reduce violations and enhance performance is subsequently studied. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>Next, the performance of RL-based controllers under datasets with different qualitative and quantitative conditions is investigated, including constraint satisfaction and power consumption.Finally, the sensitivity of certain hyperparameters is also evaluated.The results indicate that datasets of a certain suboptimality level and relatively small scale can be utilized to effectively train a well-performed RL-based HVAC controller.Specifically, such controllers can reduce at most 28.5% violation ratios of indoor temperatures and achieve at most 12.1% power savings compared to the baseline controller.In summary, this paper presents our well-structured investigations and new findings when applying offline reinforcement learning to building HVAC systems.</p>

                  <p>The increasing popularity of Artificial Intelligence in recent years has led to a surge in interest in image classification, especially in the agricultural sector.With the help of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, the sector has undergone a significant transformation, leading to the development of new techniques for crop classification in the field.Despite the extensive research on various image classification techniques, most have limitations such as low accuracy, limited use of data, and a lack of reporting model size and prediction.The most significant limitation of all is the need for model explainability.This research evaluates four different approaches for crop classification, namely traditional ML with handcrafted feature extraction methods like SIFT, ORB, and Color Histogram; Custom Designed CNN and established DL architecture like AlexNet; transfer learning on five models pre-trained using ImageNet such as EfficientNetV2, ResNet152V2, Xception, Inception-ResNetV2, MobileNetV3; and cutting-edge foundation models like YOLOv8 and DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer Model.All models performed well, but Xception outperformed all of them in terms of generalization, achieving 98% accuracy on the test data, with a model size of 80.03 MB and a prediction time of 0.0633 seconds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A key aspect of this research was the application of Explainable AI to provide the explainability of all the models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>This journal presents the explainability of Xception model with LIME, SHAP, and GradCAM, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in the models' predictions.This study highlights the importance of selecting the right model according to task-specific needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It also underscores the important role of explainability in deploying AI in agriculture, providing insightful information to help enhance AI-driven crop management strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.572</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the demand for lithium-ion batteries rapidly increases there is a need to design these cells in a safe manner to mitigate thermal runaway.Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern.Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics.Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data.The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models.Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.</p>

The proposed U-Net architecture with CNN layers mimics a classical finite element multigrid algorithm.It can be shown that the CNN efficiently approximates all operations required by the solver, including the evaluation of the residual-based error estimator.In the CNN, a culling mask set-up according to the local corrections due to refinement on each mesh level reduces the overall complexity, allowing the network optimization with localized fine-scale finite element data.   A complete convergence and complexity analysis is carried out for the adaptive multilevel scheme, which differs in several aspects from previous non-adaptive multilevel CNN.Moreover, numerical experiments with common benchmark problems from Uncertainty Quantification illustrate the practical performance of the architecture.</p>

                  <p>Human intelligence is characterized by our ability to absorb and apply knowledge from the world around us, especially in rapidly acquiring new concepts from minimal examples, underpinned by prior knowledge.Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to mimic this capacity by enabling significant generalizations and transferability.However, traditional FSL frameworks often rely on assumptions of clean, complete, and static data, conditions that are seldom met in real-world environments.Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world.This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings.We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions.Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.In conclusion, we outline potential future research directions for this evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is our hope that this review will catalyze further development of effective solutions to these complex challenges, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Object detectors are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.In contrast to classifiers, detectors possess unique characteristics, architecturally and in task execution; often operating in challenging conditions, for instance, detecting traffic signs in autonomous cars.But, our knowledge dominates attacks against classifiers and tests in the "digital domain".   To address this critical gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study targeting multiple detector architectures and two challenging detection tasks in real-world settings: traffic signs and vehicles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the diverse, methodically collected videos captured from driving cars and flying drones, incorporating physical object trigger deployments in authentic scenes, we investigated the viability of physical object-triggered backdoor attacks in application settings.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Our findings revealed 8 key insights.Importantly, the prevalent "digital" data poisoning method for injecting backdoors into models does not lead to effective attacks against detectors in the real world, although proven effective in classification tasks.We construct a new, cost-efficient attack method, dubbed MORPHING, incorporating the unique nature of detection tasks; ours is remarkably successful in injecting physical object-triggered backdoors, even capable of poisoning triggers with clean label annotations or invisible triggers without diminishing the success of physical object triggered backdoors.We discovered that the defenses curated are ill-equipped to safeguard detectors against such attacks.To underscore the severity of the threat and foster further research, we, for the first time, release an extensive video test set of real-world backdoor attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study not only establishes the credibility and seriousness of this threat but also serves as a clarion call to the research community to advance backdoor defenses in the context of object detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically aim to reflect general human values and behaviors, but they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and preferences of individual users.To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Personality Alignment.This approach tailors LLMs' responses and decisions to match the specific preferences of individual users or closely related groups.Inspired by psychometrics, we created the Personality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset, which includes data from 300,000 real subjects, each providing behavioral preferences based on the Big Five Personality Factors.This dataset allows us to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which LLMs can align with each subject's behavioral patterns.Recognizing the challenges of personality alignments: such as limited personal data, diverse preferences, and scalability requirements: we developed an activation intervention optimization method.This method enhances LLMs' ability to efficiently align with individual behavioral preferences using minimal data and computational resources.Remarkably, our method, PAS, achieves superior performance while requiring only 1/5 of the optimization time compared to DPO, offering practical value for personality alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work paves the way for future AI systems to make decisions and reason in truly personality ways, enhancing the relevance and meaning of AI interactions for each user and advancing human-centered artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>The code has released in \url{https://github.com/zhu-minjun/PAlign}.</p>
