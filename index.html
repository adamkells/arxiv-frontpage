                  <p>The quality of training data are crucial for enhancing the long-text capabilities of foundation models.Despite existing efforts to refine data quality through heuristic rules and evaluations based on data diversity and difficulty, there's a lack of systematic approaches specifically tailored for assessing long texts.Addressing this gap, our work systematically measures the quality of long texts by evaluating three fundamental linguistic dimensions: coherence, cohesion, and complexity.Drawing inspiration from the aforementioned three dimensions, we introduce a suite of metrics designed to evaluate the quality of long texts, encompassing both statistical and pre-trained language model-based ones.Leveraging these metrics, we present LongWanjuan, a bilingual dataset specifically tailored to enhance the training of language models for long-text tasks with over 160B tokens.In LongWanjuan, we categorize long texts into holistic, aggregated, and chaotic types, enabling a detailed analysis of long-text quality.Furthermore, we devise a data mixture recipe that strategically balances different types of long texts within LongWanjuan, leading to significant improvements in model performance on long-text tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LongWanjuan. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.942</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field.In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios.We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups.Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance.To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics.Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to enhancement in the model's contextual perception.Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have profoundly transformed natural language applications, with a growing reliance on instruction-based definitions for designing chatbots.However, post-deployment the chatbot definitions are fixed and are vulnerable to attacks by malicious users, emphasizing the need to prevent unethical applications and financial losses.Existing studies explore user prompts' impact on LLM-based chatbots, yet practical methods to contain attacks on application-specific chatbots remain unexplored.This paper presents System Prompt Meta Language (SPML), a domain-specific language for refining prompts and monitoring the inputs to the LLM-based chatbots.SPML actively checks attack prompts, ensuring user inputs align with chatbot definitions to prevent malicious execution on the LLM backbone, optimizing costs.It also streamlines chatbot definition crafting with programming language capabilities, overcoming natural language design challenges.Additionally, we introduce a groundbreaking benchmark with 1.8k system prompts and 20k user inputs, offering the inaugural language and benchmark for chatbot definition evaluation.Experiments across datasets demonstrate SPML's proficiency in understanding attacker prompts, surpassing models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and codes are publicly available at: https://prompt-compiler.github.io/SPML/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning architectures have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation.This may be attributed to the use of over-parameterized, monolithic deep learning architectures executed on large datasets.Although such architectures lead to increased accuracy, this is usually accompanied by a large increase in computation and memory requirements during inference.While this is a non-issue in traditional machine learning pipelines, the recent confluence of machine learning and fields like the Internet of Things has rendered such large architectures infeasible for execution in low-resource settings.In such settings, previous efforts have proposed decision cascades where inputs are passed through models of increasing complexity until desired performance is achieved.However, we argue that cascaded prediction leads to increased computational cost due to wasteful intermediate computations.To address this, we propose PaSeR (Parsimonious Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning) a non-cascading, cost-aware learning pipeline as an alternative to cascaded architectures.Through experimental evaluation on real-world and standard datasets, we demonstrate that PaSeR achieves better accuracy while minimizing computational cost relative to cascaded models.Further, we introduce a new metric IoU/GigaFlop to evaluate the balance between cost and performance.On the real-world task of battery material phase segmentation, PaSeR yields a minimum performance improvement of 174% on the IoU/GigaFlop metric with respect to baselines.We also demonstrate PaSeR's adaptability to complementary models trained on a noisy MNIST dataset, where it achieved a minimum performance improvement on IoU/GigaFlop of 13.4% over SOTA models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/scailab/paser . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, many versatile Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged continuously.However, their capacity to query information depicted in visual charts and engage in reasoning based on the queried contents remains under-explored.In this paper, to comprehensively and rigorously benchmark the ability of the off-the-shelf MLLMs in the chart domain, we construct ChartX, a multi-modal evaluation set covering 18 chart types, 7 chart tasks, 22 disciplinary topics, and high-quality chart data.Besides, we develop ChartVLM to offer a new perspective on handling multi-modal tasks that strongly depend on interpretable patterns, such as reasoning tasks in the field of charts or geometric images.We evaluate the chart-related ability of mainstream MLLMs and our ChartVLM on the proposed ChartX evaluation set.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChartVLM surpasses both versatile and chart-related large models, achieving results comparable to GPT-4V. We believe that our study can pave the way for further exploration in creating a more comprehensive chart evaluation set and developing more interpretable multi-modal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both ChartX and ChartVLM are available at: https://github.com/UniModal4Reasoning/ChartVLM <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Natural language and search interfaces intuitively facilitate data exploration and provide visualization responses to diverse analytical queries based on the underlying datasets.However, these interfaces often fail to interpret more complex analytical intents, such as discerning subtleties and quantifiable differences between terms like "bump" and "spike" in the context of COVID cases, for example.We address this gap by extending the capabilities of a data exploration search interface for interpreting semantic concepts in time series trends.We first create a comprehensive dataset of semantic concepts by mapping quantifiable univariate data trends such as slope and angle to crowdsourced, semantically meaningful trend labels.The dataset contains quantifiable properties that capture the slope-scalar effect of semantic modifiers like "sharply" and "gradually," as well as multi-line trends (e.g., "peak," "valley").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the utility of this dataset in SlopeSeeker, a tool that supports natural language querying of quantifiable trends, such as "show me stocks that tanked in 2010." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The tool incorporates novel scoring and ranking techniques based on semantic relevance and visual prominence to present relevant trend chart responses containing these semantic trend concepts.In addition, SlopeSeeker provides a faceted search interface for users to navigate a semantic hierarchy of concepts from general trends (e.g., "increase") to more specific ones (e.g., "sharp increase").A preliminary user evaluation of the tool demonstrates that the search interface supports greater expressivity of queries containing concepts that describe data trends.We identify potential future directions for leveraging our publicly available quantitative semantics dataset in other data domains and for novel visual analytics interfaces.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly replacing help forums like StackOverflow, and are especially helpful for non-professional programmers and end users.These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such as spreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if the intent is only communicated using a natural-language description, without including the data.But how do we decide how much data and which data to include in the prompt?This paper makes two contributions towards answering this question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Second, we introduce a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative rows from the input data to the LLM prompt.Our experiments show that LLM performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.</p>

                  <p>Emerging mobile virtual reality (VR) systems will require to continuously perform complex computer vision tasks on ultra-high-resolution video frames through the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs)-based algorithms.Since state-of-the-art DNNs require computational power that is excessive for mobile devices, techniques based on wireless edge computing (WEC) have been recently proposed.However, existing WEC methods require the transmission and processing of a high amount of video data which may ultimately saturate the wireless link.In this paper, we propose a novel Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing (SAWEC) paradigm to address this issue.SAWEC leverages knowledge about the physical environment to reduce the end-to-end latency and overall computational burden by transmitting to the edge server only the relevant data for the delivery of the service.Our intuition is that the transmission of the portion of the video frames where there are no changes with respect to previous frames can be avoided.Specifically, we leverage wireless sensing techniques to estimate the location of objects in the environment and obtain insights about the environment dynamics.Hence, only the part of the frames where any environmental change is detected is transmitted and processed.We evaluated SAWEC by using a 10K 360$^{\circ}$ camera with a Wi-Fi 6 sensing system operating at 160 MHz and performing localization and tracking.We perform experiments in an anechoic chamber and a hall room with two human subjects in six different setups.Experimental results show that SAWEC reduces the channel occupation, and end-to-end latency by 93.81%, and 96.19% respectively while improving the instance segmentation performance by 46.98% with respect to state-of-the-art WEC approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For reproducibility purposes, we pledge to share our whole dataset and code repository. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics.These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements).While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors.These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift.For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment.In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction.HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy.Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE.Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets and videos can be found on https://hiss-csp.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have useful applications in many different tasks, however their performance can be severely affected by changes in the data distribution.For example, in the biomedical field, their performance can be affected by changes in the data (different machines, populations) between training and test datasets.To ensure robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, test-time adaptation has been recently studied as an approach to adjust models to a new data distribution during inference.Test-time batch normalization is a simple and popular method that achieved compelling performance on domain shift benchmarks.It is implemented by recalculating batch normalization statistics on test batches.Prior work has focused on analysis with test data that has the same label distribution as the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in many practical applications this technique is vulnerable to label distribution shifts, sometimes producing catastrophic failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>This presents a risk in applying test time adaptation methods in deployment.We propose to tackle this challenge by only selectively adapting channels in a deep network, minimizing drastic adaptation that is sensitive to label shifts.Our selection scheme is based on two principles that we empirically motivate: (1) later layers of networks are more sensitive to label shift (2) individual features can be sensitive to specific classes.We apply the proposed technique to three classification tasks, including CIFAR10-C, Imagenet-C, and diagnosis of fatty liver, where we explore both covariate and label distribution shifts.We find that our method allows to bring the benefits of TTA while significantly reducing the risk of failure common in other methods, while being robust to choice in hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>Taxonomies represent an arborescence hierarchical structure that establishes relationships among entities to convey knowledge within a specific domain.Each edge in the taxonomy signifies a hypernym-hyponym relationship.Taxonomies find utility in various real-world applications, such as e-commerce search engines and recommendation systems.Consequently, there arises a necessity to enhance these taxonomies over time.However, manually curating taxonomies with neoteric data presents challenges due to limitations in available human resources and the exponential growth of data.Therefore, it becomes imperative to develop automatic taxonomy expansion methods.Traditional supervised taxonomy expansion approaches encounter difficulties stemming from limited resources, primarily due to the small size of existing taxonomies.This scarcity of training data often leads to overfitting.In this paper, we propose FLAME, a novel approach for taxonomy expansion in low-resource environments by harnessing the capabilities of large language models that are trained on extensive real-world knowledge.LLMs help compensate for the scarcity of domain-specific knowledge.Specifically, FLAME leverages prompting in few-shot settings to extract the inherent knowledge within the LLMs, ascertaining the hypernym entities within the taxonomy.Furthermore, it employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune the large language models, resulting in more accurate predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAME in real-world scenarios, achieving a remarkable improvement of 18.5% in accuracy and 12.3% in Wu & Palmer metric over eight baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Furthermore, we elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of FLAME through an extensive case study, error analysis and ablation studies on the benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Updating machine learning models with new information usually improves their predictive performance, yet, in many applications, it is also desirable to avoid changing the model predictions too much.This property is called stability.In most cases when stability matters, so does explainability.We therefore focus on the stability of an inherently explainable machine learning method, namely regression trees.We aim to use the notion of empirical stability and design algorithms for updating regression trees that provide a way to balance between predictability and empirical stability.To achieve this, we propose a regularization method, where data points are weighted based on the uncertainty in the initial model.The balance between predictability and empirical stability can be adjusted through hyperparameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This regularization method is evaluated in terms of loss and stability and assessed on a broad range of data characteristics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that the proposed update method improves stability while achieving similar or better predictive performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>This shows that it is possible to achieve both predictive and stable results when updating regression trees.</p>

                  <p>RESTful APIs based on HTTP are one of the most important ways to make data and functionality available to applications and software services.However, the quality of the API design strongly impacts API understandability and usability, and many rules have been specified for this.While we have evidence for the effectiveness of many design rules, it is still difficult for practitioners to identify rule violations in their design.We therefore present RESTRuler, a Java-based open-source tool that uses static analysis to detect design rule violations in OpenAPI descriptions.The current prototype supports 14 rules that go beyond simple syntactic checks and partly rely on natural language processing.The modular architecture also makes it easy to implement new rules.To evaluate RESTRuler, we conducted a benchmark with over 2,300 public OpenAPI descriptions and asked 7 API experts to construct 111 complicated rule violations.For robustness, RESTRuler successfully analyzed 99% of the used real-world OpenAPI definitions, with some failing due to excessive size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For performance efficiency, the tool performed well for the majority of files and could analyze 84% in less than 23 seconds with low CPU and RAM usage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, for effectiveness, RESTRuler achieved a precision of 91% (ranging from 60% to 100% per rule) and recall of 68% (ranging from 46% to 100%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these variations between rule implementations, we identified several opportunities for improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>While RESTRuler is still a research prototype, the evaluation suggests that the tool is quite robust to errors, resource-efficient for most APIs, and shows good precision and decent recall.Practitioners can use it to improve the quality of their API design.</p>

                  <p>Genome assembly is a prominent problem studied in bioinformatics, which computes the source string using a set of its overlapping substrings.Classically, genome assembly uses assembly graphs built using this set of substrings to compute the source string efficiently, having a tradeoff between scalability and avoiding information loss.The scalable de Bruijn graphs come at the price of losing crucial overlap information.The complete overlap information is stored in overlap graphs using quadratic space.Hierarchical overlap graphs [IPL20] (HOG) overcome these limitations, avoiding information loss despite using linear space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After a series of suboptimal improvements, Khan and Park et al. simultaneously presented two optimal algorithms <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>[CPM2021], where only the former was seemingly practical.   We empirically analyze all the practical algorithms for computing HOG, where the optimal algorithm[CPM2021] outperforms the previous algorithms as expected, though at the expense of extra memory.However, it uses non-intuitive approach and non-trivial data structures.We present arguably the most intuitive algorithm, using only elementary arrays, which is also optimal.Our algorithm empirically proves even better for both time and memory over all the algorithms, highlighting its significance in both theory and practice.   We further explore the applications of hierarchical overlap graphs to solve various forms of suffix-prefix queries on a set of strings.Loukides et al.[CPM2023] recently presented state-of-the-art algorithms for these queries.However, these algorithms require complex black-box data structures and are seemingly impractical.Our algorithms, despite failing to match the state-of-the-art algorithms theoretically, answer different queries ranging from 0.01-100 milliseconds for a data set having around a billion characters.</p>

                  <p>In an era of information explosion, recommender systems are vital tools to deliver personalized recommendations for users.The key of recommender systems is to forecast users' future behaviors based on previous user-item interactions.Due to their strong expressive power of capturing high-order connectivities in user-item interaction data, recent years have witnessed a rising interest in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to boost the prediction performance of recommender systems.Nonetheless, classic Matrix Factorization (MF) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches still play an important role in real-world large-scale recommender systems due to their scalability advantages.Despite the existence of GNN-acceleration solutions, it remains an open question whether GNN-based recommender systems can scale as efficiently as classic MF and DNN methods.In this paper, we propose a Linear-Time Graph Neural Network (LTGNN) to scale up GNN-based recommender systems to achieve comparable scalability as classic MF approaches while maintaining GNNs' powerful expressiveness for superior prediction accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Our implementation based on PyTorch is available.</p>

                  <p>The distance of a graph from being triangle-free is a fundamental graph parameter, counting the number of edges that need to be removed from a graph in order for it to become triangle-free.Its corresponding computational problem is the classic minimum triangle edge transversal problem, and its normalized value is the baseline for triangle-freeness testing algorithms.While triangle-freeness testing has been successfully studied in the distributed setting, computing the distance itself in a distributed setting is unknown, to the best of our knowledge, despite being well-studied in the centralized setting.   This work addresses the computation of the minimum triangle edge transversal in distributed networks.We show with a simple warm-up construction that this is a global task, requiring $\Omega(D)$ rounds even in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model with unbounded messages, where $D$ is the diameter of the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we show that approximating this value can be done much faster. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>A $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation can be obtained in $\text{poly}\log{n}$ rounds, where $n$ is the size of the network graph.Moreover, faster approximations can be obtained, at the cost of increasing the approximation factor to roughly 3, by a reduction to the minimum hypergraph vertex cover problem.With a time overhead of the maximum degree $\Delta$, this can also be applied to the $\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model, in which messages are bounded.   Our key technical contribution is proving that computing an exact solution is ``as hard as it gets'' in $\mathsf{CONGEST}$, requiring a near-quadratic number of rounds.Because this problem is an edge selection problem, as opposed to previous lower bounds that were for node selection problems, major challenges arise in constructing the lower bound, requiring us to develop novel ingredients.</p>

                  <p>Training Artificial Neural Networks poses a challenging and critical problem in machine learning.Despite the effectiveness of gradient-based learning methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in training neural networks, they do have several limitations.For instance, they require differentiable activation functions, and cannot optimize a model based on several independent non-differentiable loss functions simultaneously; for example, the F1-score, which is used during testing, can be used during training when a gradient-free optimization algorithm is utilized.Furthermore, the training in any DNN can be possible with a small size of the training dataset.To address these concerns, we propose an efficient version of the gradient-free Coordinate Search (CS) algorithm, an instance of General Pattern Search methods, for training neural networks.The proposed algorithm can be used with non-differentiable activation functions and tailored to multi-objective/multi-loss problems.Finding the optimal values for weights of ANNs is a large-scale optimization problem.Therefore instead of finding the optimal value for each variable, which is the common technique in classical CS, we accelerate optimization and convergence by bundling the weights.In fact, this strategy is a form of dimension reduction for optimization problems.Based on the experimental results, the proposed method, in some cases, outperforms the gradient-based approach, particularly, in situations with insufficient labeled training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance plots demonstrate a high convergence rate, highlighting the capability of our suggested method to find a reasonable solution with fewer function calls. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>As of now, the only practical and efficient way of training ANNs with hundreds of thousands of weights is gradient-based algorithms such as SGD or Adam.In this paper we introduce an alternative method for training ANN.</p>

                  <p>A fair classifier should ensure the benefit of people from different groups, while the group information is often sensitive and unsuitable for model training.Therefore, learning a fair classifier but excluding sensitive attributes in the training dataset is important.In this paper, we study learning fair classifiers without implementing fair training algorithms to avoid possible leakage of sensitive information.Our theoretical analyses validate the possibility of this approach, that traditional training on a dataset with an appropriate distribution shift can reduce both the upper bound for fairness disparity and model generalization error, indicating that fairness and accuracy can be improved simultaneously with simply traditional training.We then propose a tractable solution to progressively shift the original training data during training by sampling influential data, where the sensitive attribute of new data is not accessed in sampling or used in training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) aims to maintain stable and uninterrupted trajectories for each target.Most state-of-the-art approaches first detect objects in each frame and then implement data association between new detections and existing tracks using motion models and appearance similarities.Despite achieving satisfactory results, occlusion and crowds can easily lead to missing and distorted detections, followed by missing and false associations.In this paper, we first revisit the classic tracker DeepSORT, enhancing its robustness over crowds and occlusion significantly by placing greater trust in predictions when detections are unavailable or of low quality in crowded and occluded scenes.Specifically, we propose a new framework comprising of three lightweight and plug-and-play algorithms: the probability map, the prediction map, and the covariance adaptive Kalman filter.The probability map identifies whether undetected objects have genuinely disappeared from view (e.g., out of the image or entered a building) or are only temporarily undetected due to occlusion or other reasons.Trajectories of undetected targets that are still within the probability map are extended by state estimations directly.The prediction map determines whether an object is in a crowd, and we prioritize state estimations over observations when severe deformation of observations occurs, accomplished through the covariance adaptive Kalman filter.The proposed method, named MapTrack, achieves state-of-the-art results on popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT17 and MOT20.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite its superior performance, our method remains simple, online, and real-time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>The code will be open-sourced later.</p>

                  <p>In the recent literature on machine learning and decision making, calibration has emerged as a desirable and widely-studied statistical property of the outputs of binary prediction models.However, the algorithmic aspects of measuring model calibration have remained relatively less well-explored.Motivated by [BGHN23], which proposed a rigorous framework for measuring distances to calibration, we initiate the algorithmic study of calibration through the lens of property testing.We define the problem of calibration testing from samples where given $n$ draws from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on (predictions, binary outcomes), our goal is to distinguish between the case where $\mathcal{D}$ is perfectly calibrated, and the case where $\mathcal{D}$ is $\varepsilon$-far from calibration.   We design an algorithm based on approximate linear programming, which solves calibration testing information-theoretically optimally (up to constant factors) in time $O(n^{1.5} \log(n))$. This improves upon state-of-the-art black-box linear program solvers requiring $\Omega(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega > 2$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also develop algorithms for tolerant variants of our testing problem, and give sample complexity lower bounds for alternative calibration distances to the one considered in this work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we present preliminary experiments showing that the testing problem we define faithfully captures standard notions of calibration, and that our algorithms scale to accommodate moderate sample sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven by applications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expressive representations of molecules.While early graph ML methods focused primarily on small organic molecules, recently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganic materials.Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganic crystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graph ML methods are unable to address.Moving to inorganic nanomaterials increases complexity as the scale of number of nodes within each graph can be broad ($10$ to $10^5$).The bulk of existing graph ML focuses on characterising molecules and materials by predicting target properties with graphs as input.However, the most exciting applications of graph ML will be in their generative capabilities, which is currently not at par with other domains such as images or text.   We invite the graph ML community to address these open challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets: A medium-scale dataset (with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K) and a large-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nanomaterials generated from experimentally determined crystal structures (CHILI-100K).We define 11 property prediction tasks and 6 structure prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark the performance of a wide array of baseline methods and use these benchmarking results to highlight areas which need future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.891</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K are the first open-source nanomaterial datasets of this scale -- both on the individual graph level and of the dataset as a whole -- and the only nanomaterials datasets with high structural and elemental diversity.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning models continue to advance in accuracy, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which often lead to the misclassification of adversarial examples.Adversarial training is used to mitigate this problem by increasing robustness against these attacks.However, this approach typically reduces a model's standard accuracy on clean, non-adversarial samples.The necessity for deep learning models to balance both robustness and accuracy for security is obvious, but achieving this balance remains challenging, and the underlying reasons are yet to be clarified.This paper proposes a novel adversarial training method called Adversarial Feature Alignment (AFA), to address these problems.Our research unveils an intriguing insight: misalignment within the feature space often leads to misclassification, regardless of whether the samples are benign or adversarial.AFA mitigates this risk by employing a novel optimization algorithm based on contrastive learning to alleviate potential feature misalignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of AFA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The baseline AFA delivers higher robust accuracy than previous adversarial contrastive learning methods while minimizing the drop in clean accuracy to 1.86% and 8.91% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively, in comparison to cross-entropy.We also show that joint optimization of AFA and TRADES, accompanied by data augmentation using a recent diffusion model, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness.</p>

                  <p>The fairness-aware online learning framework has emerged as a potent tool within the context of continuous lifelong learning.In this scenario, the learner's objective is to progressively acquire new tasks as they arrive over time, while also guaranteeing statistical parity among various protected sub-populations, such as race and gender, when it comes to the newly introduced tasks.A significant limitation of current approaches lies in their heavy reliance on the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) assumption concerning data, leading to a static regret analysis of the framework.Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that achieving low static regret does not necessarily translate to strong performance in dynamic environments characterized by tasks sampled from diverse distributions.In this paper, to tackle the fairness-aware online learning challenge in evolving settings, we introduce a unique regret measure, FairSAR, by incorporating long-term fairness constraints into a strongly adapted loss regret framework.Moreover, to determine an optimal model parameter at each time step, we introduce an innovative adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, referred to as FairSAOML.This algorithm possesses the ability to adjust to dynamic environments by effectively managing bias control and model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The problem is framed as a bi-level convex-concave optimization, considering both the model's primal and dual parameters, which pertain to its accuracy and fairness attributes, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Theoretical analysis yields sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and the cumulative violation of fairness constraints.Our experimental evaluation on various real-world datasets in dynamic environments demonstrates that our proposed FairSAOML algorithm consistently outperforms alternative approaches rooted in the most advanced prior online learning methods.</p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) components have been increasingly integrated into the core systems of organizations.Engineering such systems presents various challenges from both a theoretical and practical perspective.One of the key challenges is the effective interaction between actors with different backgrounds who need to work closely together, such as software engineers and data scientists.This paper presents an exploratory case study to understand the current interaction and collaboration dynamics between these roles in ML projects.We conducted semi-structured interviews with four practitioners with experience in software engineering and data science of a large ML-enabled system project and analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis.Our findings reveal several challenges that can hinder collaboration between software engineers and data scientists, including differences in technical expertise, unclear definitions of each role's duties, and the lack of documents that support the specification of the ML-enabled system.We also indicate potential solutions to address these challenges, such as fostering a collaborative culture, encouraging team communication, and producing concise system documentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics between software engineers and data scientists in ML projects and provides insights for improving collaboration and communication in this context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>We encourage future studies investigating this interaction in other projects.</p>

We show that strategic individuals are over-connected at equilibrium relative to a social optimum, leading to a price of anarchy for which we derive nearly tight asymptotic bounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that, at equilibrium, individuals form connections to those who provide similar benefit to them as they provide to others. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Thus, our model provides a microfoundation in professional networking contexts for the fundamental sociological principle of homophily, that "similarity breeds connection," which in our setting is realized as a form of status homophily based on alignment in individual benefit.We further explore how, even if individuals are a priori equally likely to receive opportunities from outside sources, equilibria can be unequal, and we provide nearly tight bounds on how unequal they can be.Finally, we explore the ability for online platforms to intervene to improve social welfare and show that natural heuristics may result in adverse effects at equilibrium.Our simple model allows for a surprisingly rich analysis of coordination problems in professional networks and suggests many directions for further exploration.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we tackle the complex task of analyzing televised debates, with a focus on a prime time news debate show from India.Previous methods, which often relied solely on text, fall short in capturing the multimedia essence of these debates.To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive automated toolkit that employs advanced computer vision and speech-to-text techniques for large-scale multimedia analysis.Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and speech-to-text methods, we transcribe, diarize, and analyze thousands of YouTube videos of prime-time television debates in India.These debates are a central part of Indian media but have been criticized for compromised journalistic integrity and excessive dramatization.Our toolkit provides concrete metrics to assess bias and incivility, capturing a comprehensive multimedia perspective that includes text, audio utterances, and video frames.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal significant biases in topic selection and panelist representation, along with alarming levels of incivility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>This work offers a scalable, automated approach for future research in multimedia analysis, with profound implications for the quality of public discourse and democratic debate.We will make our data analysis pipeline and collected data publicly available to catalyze further research in this domain.</p>

                  <p>Temporal distribution shifts are ubiquitous in time series data.One of the most popular methods assumes that the temporal distribution shift occurs uniformly to disentangle the stationary and nonstationary dependencies.But this assumption is difficult to meet, as we do not know when the distribution shifts occur.To solve this problem, we propose to learn IDentifiable latEnt stAtes (IDEA) to detect when the distribution shifts occur.Beyond that, we further disentangle the stationary and nonstationary latent states via sufficient observation assumption to learn how the latent states change.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we formalize the causal process with environment-irrelated station- ary and environment-related nonstationary variables. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Under mild conditions, we show that latent environments and stationary/nonstationary variables are identifiable.Based on these theories, we devise the IDEA model, which incorporates an autoregressive hidden Markov model to estimate latent environments and modular prior networks to identify latent states.The IDEA model outperforms several latest nonstationary forecasting methods on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its advantages in real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The solution of a PDE over varying initial/boundary conditions on multiple domains is needed in a wide variety of applications, but it is computationally expensive if the solution is computed de novo whenever the initial/boundary conditions of the domain change.We introduce a general operator learning framework, called DIffeomorphic Mapping Operator learNing (DIMON) to learn approximate PDE solutions over a family of domains $\{\Omega_{\theta}}_\theta$, that learns the map from initial/boundary conditions and domain $\Omega_\theta$ to the solution of the PDE, or to specified functionals thereof.DIMON is based on transporting a given problem (initial/boundary conditions and domain $\Omega_{\theta}$) to a problem on a reference domain $\Omega_{0}$, where training data from multiple problems is used to learn the map to the solution on $\Omega_{0}$, which is then re-mapped to the original domain $\Omega_{\theta}$. We consider several problems to demonstrate the performance of the framework in learning both static and time-dependent PDEs on non-rigid geometries; these include solving the Laplace equation, reaction-diffusion equations, and a multiscale PDE that characterizes the electrical propagation on the left ventricle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work paves the way toward the fast prediction of PDE solutions on a family of domains and the application of neural operators in engineering and precision medicine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

                  <p>In general, underwater images suffer from color distortion and low contrast, because light is attenuated and backscattered as it propagates through water (differently depending on wavelength and on the properties of the water body).An existing simple degradation model (similar to atmospheric image "hazing" effects), though helpful, is not sufficient to properly represent the underwater image degradation because there are unaccounted for and non-measurable factors e.g. scattering of light due to turbidity of water, reflective characteristics of turbid medium etc.We propose a deep learning-based architecture to automatically simulate the underwater effects where only a dehazing-like image formation equation is known to the network, and the additional degradation due to the other unknown factors if inferred in a data-driven way.We only use RGB images (because in real-time scenario depth image is not available) to estimate the depth image.For testing, we have proposed (due to the lack of real underwater image datasets) a complex image formation model/equation to manually generate images that resemble real underwater images (used as ground truth).However, only the classical image formation equation (the one used for image dehazing) is informed to the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This mimics the fact that in a real scenario, the physics are never completely known and only simplified models are known. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>Thanks to the ground truth, generated by a complex image formation equation, we could successfully perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of proposed technique, compared to other purely data driven approaches</p>

                  <p>Neurosymbolic AI combines the interpretability, parsimony, and explicit reasoning of classical symbolic approaches with the statistical learning of data-driven neural approaches.Models and policies that are simultaneously differentiable and interpretable may be key enablers of this marriage.This paper demonstrates three pathways to implementing such models and policies in a real-world reinforcement learning setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we study a broad class of neural networks that build interpretable semantics directly into their architecture. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>We reveal and highlight both the potential and the essential difficulties of combining logic, simulation, and learning.One lesson is that learning benefits from continuity and differentiability, but classical logic is discrete and non-differentiable.The relaxation to real-valued, differentiable representations presents a trade-off; the more learnable, the less interpretable.Another lesson is that using logic in the context of a numerical simulation involves a non-trivial mapping from raw (e.g., real-valued time series) simulation data to logical predicates.Some open questions this note exposes include: What are the limits of rule-based controllers, and how learnable are they?Do the differentiable interpretable approaches discussed here scale to large, complex, uncertain systems?Can we truly achieve interpretability?We highlight these and other themes across the three approaches.</p>

We show that this problem is NP-complete for many simple classes of graphs, the problem of determining the fastest schedule, defined by the number of time steps required for a robot to visit every vertex in the schedule and complete every task assigned in its assigned schedule.Explicitly, we provide this result for complete graphs, bipartite graphs, star graphs, and planar graphs.Finally, we provide positive results for line graphs, showing that we can find an optimal set of schedules for $k$ robots completing $m$ tasks of equal length of a path of length $n$ in $O(kmn)$ time, and a $k$-approximation when the length of the tasks is unbounded.</p>
