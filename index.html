                  <p>Image forgery is a topic that has been studied for many years.Before the breakthrough of deep learning, forged images were detected using handcrafted features that did not require training.These traditional methods failed to perform satisfactorily even on datasets much worse in quality than real-life image manipulations.Advances in deep learning have impacted image forgery detection as much as they have impacted other areas of computer vision and have improved the state of the art.Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training.In the case of image forgery, labeled data at the pixel level is a very important factor for the models to learn.None of the existing datasets have sufficient size, realism and pixel-level labeling at the same time.This is due to the high cost of producing and labeling quality images.It can take hours for an image editing expert to manipulate just one image.To bridge this gap, we automate data generation using image composition techniques that are very related to image forgery.Unlike other automated data generation frameworks, we use state of the art image composition deep learning models to generate spliced images close to the quality of real-life manipulations.Finally, we test the generated dataset on the SOTA image manipulation detection model and show that its prediction performance is lower compared to existing datasets, i.e. we produce realistic images that are more difficult to detect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset will be available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIS25k . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.983</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks.In ViT, we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self attention blocks.However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ViTs simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g., locality,etc. ).Due to this, ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training.Various data efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively.However, limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>In DeiT-LT, we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes.This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks, improving generalization for tail classes.Further, to mitigate overfitting, we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher, which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks.With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme, the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes, and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes.The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture.We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.</p>

                  <p>3D dense captioning stands as a cornerstone in achieving a comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes through natural language.It has recently witnessed remarkable achievements, particularly in indoor settings.However, the exploration of 3D dense captioning in outdoor scenes is hindered by two major challenges: 1) the \textbf{domain gap} between indoor and outdoor scenes, such as dynamics and sparse visual inputs, makes it difficult to directly adapt existing indoor methods; 2) the \textbf{lack of data} with comprehensive box-caption pair annotations specifically tailored for outdoor scenes.To this end, we introduce the new task of outdoor 3D dense captioning.As input, we assume a LiDAR point cloud and a set of RGB images captured by the panoramic camera rig.The expected output is a set of object boxes with captions.To tackle this task, we propose the TOD3Cap network, which leverages the BEV representation to generate object box proposals and integrates Relation Q-Former with LLaMA-Adapter to generate rich captions for these objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce the TOD3Cap dataset, the largest one to our knowledge for 3D dense captioning in outdoor scenes, which contains 2.3M descriptions of 64.3K outdoor objects from 850 scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.931</span></span>Notably, our TOD3Cap network can effectively localize and caption 3D objects in outdoor scenes, which outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin (+9.6 CiDEr@0.5IoU).Code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/jxbbb/TOD3Cap.</p>

                  <p>Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system.This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR).When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively.However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data.Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs.Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span>The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed.The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.</p>

Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models, from the standard ResNet visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4, significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60\%.Our work suggests that diffusion models can be an effective source to test vision models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenshuang-zhang/imagenet_d. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in benchmarking object detectors over the past decade.Like every dataset, COCO contains subtle errors and imperfections stemming from its annotation procedure.With the advent of high-performing models, we ask whether these errors of COCO are hindering its utility in reliably benchmarking further progress.In search for an answer, we inspect thousands of masks from COCO (2017 version) and uncover different types of errors such as imprecise mask boundaries, non-exhaustively annotated instances, and mislabeled masks.Due to the prevalence of COCO, we choose to correct these errors to maintain continuity with prior research.We develop COCO-ReM (Refined Masks), a cleaner set of annotations with visibly better mask quality than COCO-2017.We evaluate fifty object detectors and find that models that predict visually sharper masks score higher on COCO-ReM, affirming that they were being incorrectly penalized due to errors in COCO-2017.Moreover, our models trained using COCO-ReM converge faster and score higher than their larger variants trained using COCO-2017, highlighting the importance of data quality in improving object detectors.With these findings, we advocate using COCO-ReM for future object detection research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is available at https://cocorem.xyz <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.979</span></span></p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has attracted increasing attention for tackling distribution shifts during the test time.Though prior studies have achieved very promising performance, they involve intensive computation which is severely unaligned with test-time adaptation.We design TDA, a training-free dynamic adapter that enables effective and efficient test-time adaptation with vision-language models.TDA works with a lightweight key-value cache that maintains a dynamic queue with few-shot pseudo labels as values and the corresponding test-sample features as keys.Leveraging the key-value cache, TDA allows adapting to test data gradually via progressive pseudo label refinement which is super-efficient without incurring any backpropagation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce negative pseudo labeling that alleviates the adverse impact of pseudo label noises by assigning pseudo labels to certain negative classes when the model is uncertain about its pseudo label predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>Extensive experiments over two benchmarks demonstrate TDA's superior effectiveness and efficiency as compared with the state-of-the-art.The code has been released in \url{https://kdiaaa.github.io/tda/}.</p>

                  <p>Predictions of opaque black-box systems are frequently deployed in high-stakes applications such as healthcare.For such applications, it is crucial to assess how models handle samples beyond the domain of training data.While several metrics and tests exist to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) data from in-distribution (InD) data to a deep neural network (DNN), their performance varies significantly across datasets, models, and tasks, which limits their practical use.In this paper, we propose a hypothesis-driven approach to quantify whether a new sample is InD or OoD.Given a trained DNN and some input, we first feed the input through the DNN and compute an ensemble of OoD metrics, which we term latent responses.We then formulate the OoD detection problem as a hypothesis test between latent responses of different groups, and use permutation-based resampling to infer the significance of the observed latent responses under a null hypothesis.We adapt our method to detect an unseen sample of bacteria to a trained deep learning model, and show that it reveals interpretable differences between InD and OoD latent responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work has implications for systematic novelty detection and informed decision-making from classifiers trained on a subset of labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

Afterward, the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are considered to memorize clean data, while the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ are considered to memorize mislabeled data.Benefiting from the memorization effect, the updates of the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are encouraged to fully memorize clean data in early training, and then discouraged with the increase of training epochs to reduce interference of mislabeled data.The updates of the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ are the opposite.In testing, only the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are employed to enhance generalization.Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks confirm the superior performance of our method.</p>

                  <p>Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in learning semantic category discrimination.Despite the remarkable performance of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to the well-annotated data.However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the multimodal scenario.In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges -- enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and \emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval.First, we propose a semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend different modalities and provide precise transport cost.Second, to narrow the discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching.Both of these two components leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate effective cost function.The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.</p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art neural rankers pre-trained on large task-specific training data such as MS-MARCO, have been shown to exhibit strong performance on various ranking tasks without domain adaptation, also called zero-shot.However, zero-shot neural ranking may be sub-optimal, as it does not take advantage of the target domain information.Unfortunately, acquiring sufficiently large and high quality target training data to improve a modern neural ranker can be costly and time-consuming.To address this problem, we propose a new approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for ranking, DUQGen, which addresses a critical gap in prior literature, namely how to automatically generate both effective and diverse synthetic training data to fine tune a modern neural ranker for a new domain.Specifically, DUQGen produces a more effective representation of the target domain by identifying clusters of similar documents; and generates a more diverse training dataset by probabilistic sampling over the resulting document clusters.Our extensive experiments, over the standard BEIR collection, demonstrate that DUQGen consistently outperforms all zero-shot baselines and substantially outperforms the SOTA baselines on 16 out of 18 datasets, for an average of 4% relative improvement across all datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We complement our results with a thorough analysis for more in-depth understanding of the proposed method's performance and to identify promising areas for further improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span></p>

                  <p>To mitigate forgetting, existing lifelong event detection methods typically maintain a memory module and replay the stored memory data during the learning of a new task.However, the simple combination of memory data and new-task samples can still result in substantial forgetting of previously acquired knowledge, which may occur due to the potential overlap between the feature distribution of new data and the previously learned embedding space.Moreover, the model suffers from overfitting on the few memory samples rather than effectively remembering learned patterns.To address the challenges of forgetting and overfitting, we propose a novel method based on embedding space separation and compaction.Our method alleviates forgetting of previously learned tasks by forcing the feature distribution of new data away from the previous embedding space.It also mitigates overfitting by a memory calibration mechanism that encourages memory data to be close to its prototype to enhance intra-class compactness.In addition, the learnable parameters of the new task are initialized by drawing upon acquired knowledge from the previously learned task to facilitate forward knowledge transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>The choice of a graph learning (GL) model (i.e., a GL algorithm and its hyperparameter settings) has a significant impact on the performance of downstream tasks.However, selecting the right GL model becomes increasingly difficult and time consuming as more and more GL models are developed.Accordingly, it is of great significance and practical value to equip users of GL with the ability to perform a near-instantaneous selection of an effective GL model without manual intervention.Despite the recent attempts to tackle this important problem, there has been no comprehensive benchmark environment to evaluate the performance of GL model selection methods.To bridge this gap, we present GLEMOS in this work, a comprehensive benchmark for instantaneous GL model selection that makes the following contributions.(i) GLEMOS provides extensive benchmark data for fundamental GL tasks, i.e., link prediction and node classification, including the performances of 366 models on 457 graphs on these tasks.(ii) GLEMOS designs multiple evaluation settings, and assesses how effectively representative model selection techniques perform in these different settings.(iii) GLEMOS is designed to be easily extended with new models, new graphs, and new performance records.(iv) Based on the experimental results, we discuss the limitations of existing approaches and highlight future research directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To promote research on this significant problem, we make the benchmark data and code publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/glemos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent progress in generative AI, primarily through diffusion models, presents significant challenges for real-world deepfake detection.The increased realism in image details, diverse content, and widespread accessibility to the general public complicates the identification of these sophisticated deepfakes.Acknowledging the urgency to address the vulnerability of current deepfake detectors to this evolving threat, our paper introduces two extensive deepfake datasets generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models as other datasets are less diverse and low in quality.Our extensive experiments also showed that our dataset is more challenging compared to the other face deepfake datasets.Our strategic dataset creation not only challenge the deepfake detectors but also sets a new benchmark for more evaluation.Our comprehensive evaluation reveals the struggle of existing detection methods, often optimized for specific image domains and manipulations, to effectively adapt to the intricate nature of diffusion deepfakes, limiting their practical utility.To address this critical issue, we investigate the impact of enhancing training data diversity on representative detection methods.This involves expanding the diversity of both manipulation techniques and image domains.Our findings underscore that increasing training data diversity results in improved generalizability.Moreover, we propose a novel momentum difficulty boosting strategy to tackle the additional challenge posed by training data heterogeneity.This strategy dynamically assigns appropriate sample weights based on learning difficulty, enhancing the model's adaptability to both easy and challenging samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on both existing and newly proposed benchmarks demonstrate that our model optimization approach surpasses prior alternatives significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating realistic hand motion sequences in interaction with objects has gained increasing attention with the growing interest in digital humans.Prior work has illustrated the effectiveness of employing occupancy-based or distance-based virtual sensors to extract hand-object interaction features.Nonetheless, these methods show limited generalizability across object categories, shapes and sizes.We hypothesize that this is due to two reasons: 1) the limited expressiveness of employed virtual sensors, and 2) scarcity of available training data.To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel joint-centered sensor designed to reason about local object geometry near potential interaction regions.The sensor queries for object surface points in the neighbourhood of each hand joint.As an important step towards mitigating the learning complexity, we transform the points from global frame to hand template frame and use a shared module to process sensor features of each individual joint.This is followed by a spatio-temporal transformer network aimed at capturing correlation among the joints in different dimensions.Moreover, we devise simple heuristic rules to augment the limited training sequences with vast static hand grasping samples.This leads to a broader spectrum of grasping types observed during training, in turn enhancing our model's generalization capability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on two public datasets, GRAB and InterCap, where our method shows superiority over baselines both quantitatively and perceptually. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>An important use case of next-generation wireless systems is device-edge co-inference, where a semantic task is partitioned between a device and an edge server.The device carries out data collection and partial processing of the data, while the remote server completes the given task based on information received from the device.It is often required that processing and communication be run as efficiently as possible at the device, while more computing resources are available at the edge.To address such scenarios, we introduce a new system solution, termed neuromorphic wireless device-edge co-inference.According to it, the device runs sensing, processing, and communication units using neuromorphic hardware, while the server employs conventional radio and computing technologies.The proposed system is designed using a transmitter-centric information-theoretic criterion that targets a reduction of the communication overhead, while retaining the most relevant information for the end-to-end semantic task of interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results on standard data sets validate the proposed architecture, and a preliminary testbed realization is reported. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data.Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data.To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment.However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications.Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts.To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model.Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively.Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences.RLHF contains three steps, i.e., human preference collecting, reward learning, and policy optimization, which are usually performed serially.Despite its popularity, however, (fixed) reward models may suffer from inaccurate off-distribution, since policy optimization continuously shifts LLMs' data distribution.Repeatedly collecting new preference data from the latest LLMs may alleviate this issue, which unfortunately makes the resulting system more complicated and difficult to optimize.In this paper, we propose reward learning on policy (RLP), an unsupervised framework that refines a reward model using policy samples to keep it on-distribution.Specifically, an unsupervised multi-view learning method is introduced to learn robust representations of policy samples.Meanwhile, a synthetic preference generation approach is developed to simulate high-quality preference data with policy outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that RLP consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/rlp}.</p>

                  <p>For severely affected COVID-19 patients, it is crucial to identify high-risk patients and predict survival and need for intensive care (ICU).Most of the proposed models are not well reported making them less reproducible and prone to high risk of bias particularly in presence of imbalance data/class.In this study, the performances of nine machine and deep learning algorithms in combination with two widely used feature selection methods were investigated to predict last status representing mortality, ICU requirement, and ventilation days.Fivefold cross-validation was used for training and validation purposes.To minimize bias, the training and testing sets were split maintaining similar distributions.Only 10 out of 122 features were found to be useful in prediction modelling with Acute kidney injury during hospitalization feature being the most important one.The algorithms performances depend on feature numbers and data pre-processing techniques.LSTM performs the best in predicting last status and ICU requirement with 90%, 92%, 86% and 95% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DNN performs the best in predicting Ventilation days with 88% accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Considering all the factors and limitations including absence of exact time point of clinical onset, LSTM with carefully selected features can accurately predict last status and ICU requirement.DNN performs the best in predicting Ventilation days.Appropriate machine learning algorithm with carefully selected features and balance data can accurately predict mortality, ICU requirement and ventilation support.Such model can be very useful in emergency and pandemic where prompt and precise</p>

                  <p>In the evolving field of psychopathology, the accurate assessment and forecasting of data derived from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is crucial.EMA offers contextually-rich psychopathological measurements over time, that practically lead to Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data.Thus, many challenges arise in analysis from the temporal complexities inherent in emotional, behavioral, and contextual EMA data as well as their inter-dependencies.To address both of these aspects, this research investigates the performance of Recurrent and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).Overall, GNNs, by incorporating additional information from graphs reflecting the inner relationships between the variables, notably enhance the results by decreasing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 0.84 compared to the baseline LSTM model at 1.02.Therefore, the effect of constructing graphs with different characteristics on GNN performance is also explored.Additionally, GNN-learned graphs, which are dynamically refined during the training process, were evaluated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using such graphs showed a similarly good performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Thus, graph learning proved also promising for other GNN methods, potentially refining the pre-defined graphs.</p>

                  <p>Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational approach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within artificial intelligence.This method extends to the training of DNNs, an approach known as neuroevolution.However, neuroevolution is an inherently resource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of thousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network.To address the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still attaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution.Despite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into neuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the effective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in neuroevolution.In this context, we address these challenges by employing a suitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as NeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares.The amalgamation of these two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the NeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM).For comparison purposes, we also code and use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice in neuroevolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16 model in accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN operations, a singular run is typically the norm.To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Significantly, our methodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model demonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Noteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25% reduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for neuroevolution.</p>

                  <p>Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a promising task to train high-performance small models to enhance actual deployment without relying on the original training data.Existing methods commonly avoid relying on private data by utilizing synthetic or sampled data.However, a long-overlooked issue is that the severe distribution shifts between their substitution and original data, which manifests as huge differences in the quality of images and class proportions.The harmful shifts are essentially the confounder that significantly causes performance bottlenecks.To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a novel perspective with causal inference to disentangle the student models from the impact of such shifts.By designing a customized causal graph, we first reveal the causalities among the variables in the DFKD task.Subsequently, we propose a Knowledge Distillation Causal Intervention (KDCI) framework based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder.KDCI can be flexibly combined with most existing state-of-the-art baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments in combination with six representative DFKD methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDCI, which can obviously help existing methods under almost all settings, \textit{e.g.}, improving the baseline by up to 15.54\% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation.Yet, incorporating LLM-based code generation into real-life software projects poses challenges, as the generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information.As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper puts forward a novel approach, termed ProCoder, which iteratively refines the project-level code context for precise code generation, guided by the compiler feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>In particular, ProCoder first leverages compiler techniques to identify a mismatch between the generated code and the project's context.It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository.We integrate ProCoder with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation.Experimental results show that ProCoder significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on project context, and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines.</p>

                  <p>Effective agent coordination is crucial in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).While agent cooperation can be represented by graph structures, prevailing graph learning methods in MARL are limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They rely solely on one-step observations, neglecting crucial historical experiences, leading to deficient graphs that foster redundant or detrimental information exchanges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.588</span></span>Additionally, high computational demands for action-pair calculations in dense graphs impede scalability.To address these challenges, we propose inferring a Latent Temporal Sparse Coordination Graph (LTS-CG) for MARL.The LTS-CG leverages agents' historical observations to calculate an agent-pair probability matrix, where a sparse graph is sampled from and used for knowledge exchange between agents, thereby simultaneously capturing agent dependencies and relation uncertainty.The computational complexity of this procedure is only related to the number of agents.This graph learning process is further augmented by two innovative characteristics: Predict-Future, which enables agents to foresee upcoming observations, and Infer-Present, ensuring a thorough grasp of the environmental context from limited data.These features allow LTS-CG to construct temporal graphs from historical and real-time information, promoting knowledge exchange during policy learning and effective collaboration.Graph learning and agent training occur simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.Our demonstrated results on the StarCraft II benchmark underscore LTS-CG's superior performance.</p>

                  <p>The timely detection of disease outbreaks through reliable early warning signals (EWSs) is indispensable for effective public health mitigation strategies.Nevertheless, the intricate dynamics of real-world disease spread, often influenced by diverse sources of noise and limited data in the early stages of outbreaks, pose a significant challenge in developing reliable EWSs, as the performance of existing indicators varies with extrinsic and intrinsic noises.Here, we address the challenge of modeling disease when the measurements are corrupted by additive white noise, multiplicative environmental noise, and demographic noise into a standard epidemic mathematical model.To navigate the complexities introduced by these noise sources, we employ a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in infectious disease outbreak by training on noise-induced disease-spreading models.The indicator's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to real-world COVID-19 cases in Edmonton and simulated time series derived from diverse disease spread models affected by noise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the indicator captures an impending transition in a time series of disease outbreaks and outperforms existing indicators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.564</span></span>This study contributes to advancing early warning capabilities by addressing the intricate dynamics inherent in real-world disease spread, presenting a promising avenue for enhancing public health preparedness and response efforts.</p>

On the other hand, using large base objects, we give a strong possibility result in the form of a universal construction: an object with $s$ possible states can be implemented in a wait-free, history-independent manner from compare-and-swap base objects that each have $O(s + 2^n)$ possible memory states, where $n$ is the number of processes in the system.</p>

                  <p>Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image processing.These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry.However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many challenges have emerged.This thesis presents various approaches that address robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.   Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before certification and deployment in practice.Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the adversarial attack literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, building trust in AI-based models requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that are more explainable and interpretable a priori.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and explainability.Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in the related research.Besides methodological developments for robust and explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and improving their design and robustness.In addition to the theoretical developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.</p>

                  <p>The continual expansion of software size and complexity has led to an increased focus on reducing defects and bugs during development.Although Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) offer help, in practice, the significant number of false positives can impede developers' productivity and confidence in the tools.Therefore, previous research efforts have explored learning-based methods to validate the reported warnings.Nevertheless, there are still some limitations.(1) The granularity of prior research is coarse, as it focuses on identifying either actionable warnings throughout extensive development histories or potential true warnings at the function level.These approaches lack specificity regarding individual bugs and warnings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Machine learning-based approaches need much manual effort for feature engineering while existing deep learning-based approaches ignore key semantics between source code and warnings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>(3) The small number of selected projects hinders the comprehensive evaluation of these approaches.In this paper, we proposed a fine-grained warning verification approach that is sensitive to bugs for improving the results of ASATs, namely \ourtool.Specifically, we design a novel LSTM-based model that captures both fine-grained semantics of source code and warnings from ASATs and highlights their correlations with cross-attention.To tackle the data scarcity of training and evaluation, we collected a large-scale dataset of 280,273 warnings, namely FineWA.It is ten times larger than the existing largest dataset.Then, we conducted extensive experiments on the dataset to evaluate FineWAVE.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with an F1-score of 97.79% for reducing false alarms and 67.06% for confirming actual warnings, which also significantly outperforms all baselines.</p>

                  <p>Over the last year, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become widely available and have exhibited fairness issues similar to those in previous machine learning systems.Current research is primarily focused on analyzing and quantifying these biases in training data and their impact on the decisions of these models, alongside developing mitigation strategies.This research largely targets well-known biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and language.However, it is clear that LLMs are also affected by other, less obvious implicit biases.The complex and often opaque nature of these models makes detecting such biases challenging, yet this is crucial due to their potential negative impact in various applications.In this paper, we explore new avenues for detecting these unanticipated biases in LLMs, focusing specifically on Uncertainty Quantification and Explainable AI methods.These approaches aim to assess the certainty of model decisions and to make the internal decision-making processes of LLMs more transparent, thereby identifying and understanding biases that are not immediately apparent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through this research, we aim to contribute to the development of fairer and more transparent AI systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly increased their presence in human-facing Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.However, LLMs could reproduce and even exacerbate stereotypical outputs from training data.This work introduces the Multi-Grain Stereotype (MGS) dataset, encompassing 51,867 instances across gender, race, profession, religion, and stereotypical text, collected by fusing multiple previously publicly available stereotype detection datasets.We explore different machine learning approaches aimed at establishing baselines for stereotype detection, and fine-tune several language models of various architectures and model sizes, presenting in this work a series of stereotypes classifier models for English text trained on MGS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To understand whether our stereotype detectors capture relevant features (aligning with human common sense) we utilise a variety of explanainable AI tools, including SHAP, LIME, and BertViz, and analyse a series of example cases discussing the results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Finally, we develop a series of stereotype elicitation prompts and evaluate the presence of stereotypes in text generation tasks with popular LLMs, using one of our best performing previously presented stereotypes detectors.Our experiments yielded several key findings: i) Training stereotype detectors in a multi-dimension setting yields better results than training multiple single-dimension classifiers.ii) The integrated MGS Dataset enhances both the in-dataset and cross-dataset generalisation ability of stereotype detectors compared to using the datasets separately.iii)There is a reduction in stereotypes in the content generated by GPT Family LLMs with newer versions.</p>

                  <p>Efficiently tackling multiple tasks within complex environment, such as those found in robot manipulation, remains an ongoing challenge in robotics and an opportunity for data-driven solutions, such as reinforcement learning (RL).Model-based RL, by building a dynamic model of the robot, enables data reuse and transfer learning between tasks with the same robot and similar environment.Furthermore, data gathering in robotics is expensive and we must rely on data efficient approaches such as model-based RL, where policy learning is mostly conducted on cheaper simulations based on the learned model.Therefore, the quality of the model is fundamental for the performance of the posterior tasks.In this work, we focus on improving the quality of the model and maintaining the data efficiency by performing active learning of the dynamic model during a preliminary exploration phase based on maximize information gathering.We employ Bayesian neural network models to represent, in a probabilistic way, both the belief and information encoded in the dynamic model during exploration.With our presented strategies we manage to actively estimate the novelty of each transition, using this as the exploration reward.In this work, we compare several Bayesian inference methods for neural networks, some of which have never been used in a robotics context, and evaluate them in a realistic robot manipulation setup.Our experiments show the advantages of our Bayesian model-based RL approach, with similar quality in the results than relevant alternatives with much lower requirements regarding robot execution steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike related previous studies that focused the validation solely on toy problems, our research takes a step towards more realistic setups, tackling robotic arm end-tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span></p>
