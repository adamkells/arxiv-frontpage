                  <p>Recently, Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) have garnered increasing attention for their potential to deliver emotional value and facilitate sociological research.However, existing studies are primarily confined to the textual modality, unable to simulate humans' multimodal perceptual capabilities.To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs), and propose a comprehensive framework, MMRole, for their development and evaluation, which comprises a personalized multimodal dataset and a robust evaluation method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, MMRole-Data, consisting of 85 characters, 11K images, and 14K single or multi-turn dialogues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.955</span></span>Additionally, we present a robust evaluation method, MMRole-Eval, encompassing eight metrics across three dimensions, where a reward model is trained to score MRPAs with the constructed ground-truth data for comparison.Moreover, we develop the first specialized MRPA, MMRole-Agent.Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the improved performance of MMRole-Agent and highlight the primary challenges in developing MRPAs, emphasizing the need for enhanced multimodal understanding and role-playing consistency.The data, code, and models will be available at https://github.com/YanqiDai/MMRole.</p>

                  <p>Recent widespread applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) -- from infrastructure inspection to urban logistics -- have prompted an urgent need for high-accuracy three-dimensional (3D) radio maps.However, existing methods designed for two-dimensional radio maps face challenges of high measurement costs and limited data availability when extended to 3D scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle these challenges, we first build a real-world large-scale 3D radio map dataset, covering over 4.2 million m^3 and over 4 thousand data points in complex urban environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span>We propose a Gaussian Process Regression-based scheme for 3D radio map estimation, allowing us to realize more accurate map recovery with a lower RMSE than state-of-the-art schemes by over 2.5 dB. To further enhance data efficiency, we propose two methods for training point selection, including an offline clustering-based method and an online maximum a posterior (MAP)-based method.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves full-map recovery with only 2% of UAV measurements, but also sheds light on future studies on 3D radio maps.</p>

                  <p>Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success.Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture.However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models.To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data.Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data.To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c)Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies.These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility.Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset are publicly available https://github.com/xinzzzhou/ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF.git. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, impressive performance of deep learning technology has been recognized in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR).Since a large amount of annotated data is required in this technique, it poses a trenchant challenge to the issue of obtaining a high recognition rate through less labeled data.To overcome this problem, inspired by the contrastive learning, we proposed a novel framework named Batch Instance Discrimination and Feature Clustering (BIDFC).In this framework, different from that of the objective of general contrastive learning methods, embedding distance between samples should be moderate because of the high similarity between samples in the SAR images.Consequently, our flexible framework is equipped with adjustable distance between embedding, which we term as weakly contrastive learning.Technically, instance labels are assigned to the unlabeled data in per batch and random augmentation and training are performed few times on these augmented data.Meanwhile, a novel Dynamic-Weighted Variance loss (DWV loss) function is also posed to cluster the embedding of enhanced versions for each sample.Experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) database indicate a 91.25% classification accuracy of our method fine-tuned on only 3.13% training data.Even though a linear evaluation is performed on the same training data, the accuracy can still reach 90.13%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also verified the effectiveness of BIDFC in OpenSarShip database, indicating that our method can be generalized to other datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>Our code is avaliable at: https://github.com/Wenlve-Zhou/BIDFC-master.</p>

                  <p>Vision transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision for modeling long-term dependencies, yet face two key challenges for image quality assessment (IQA): discarding fine details during patch embedding, and requiring extensive training data due to lack of inductive biases.In this study, we propose a Global-Local progressive INTegration network for IQA, called GlintIQA, to address these issues through three key components: 1) Hybrid feature extraction combines ViT-based global feature extractor (VGFE) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor (CLFE) to capture global coarse-grained features and local fine-grained features, respectively.The incorporation of CNNs mitigates the patch-level information loss and inductive bias constraints inherent to ViT architectures.2) Progressive feature integration leverages diverse kernel sizes in embedding to spatially align coarse- and fine-grained features, and progressively aggregate these features by interactively stacking channel-wise attention and spatial enhancement modules to build effective quality-aware representations.3) Content similarity-based labeling approach is proposed that automatically assigns quality labels to images with diverse content based on subjective quality scores.This addresses the scarcity of labeled training data in synthetic datasets and bolsters model generalization.The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding 5.04% average SROCC gains on cross-authentic dataset evaluations.Moreover, our model and its counterpart pre-trained on the proposed dataset respectively exhibited 5.40% and 13.23% improvements on across-synthetic datasets evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and proposed dataset will be released at https://github.com/XiaoqiWang/GlintIQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks.Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances.Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions.By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation.Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks.Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method for image understanding tasks under Curriculum Learning (CL) paradigm which leverages RGB-D. The method utilizes Multi-Modal Contrastive Masked Autoencoder and Denoising techniques.Recent approaches either use masked autoencoding (e.g., MultiMAE) or contrastive learning(e.g., Pri3D, or combine them in a single contrastive masked autoencoder architecture such as CMAE and CAV-MAE.However, none of the single contrastive masked autoencoder is applicable to RGB-D datasets.To improve the performance and efficacy of such methods, we propose a new pre-training strategy based on CL.Specifically, in the first stage, we pre-train the model using contrastive learning to learn cross-modal representations.In the second stage, we initialize the modality-specific encoders using the weights from the first stage and then pre-train the model using masked autoencoding and denoising/noise prediction used in diffusion models.Masked autoencoding focuses on reconstructing the missing patches in the input modality using local spatial correlations, while denoising learns high frequency components of the input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is scalable, robust and suitable for pre-training with limited RGB-D datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as ScanNet, NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D show the efficacy and superior performance of our approach.Specifically, we show an improvement of +1.0% mIoU against Mask3D on ScanNet semantic segmentation.We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in low-data regime by evaluating it for semantic segmentation task against the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>This article presents the OpenCitations Index, a collection of open citation data maintained by OpenCitations, an independent, not-for-profit infrastructure organisation for open scholarship dedicated to publishing open bibliographic and citation data using Semantic Web and Linked Open Data technologies.The collection involves citation data harvested from multiple sources.To address the possibility of different sources providing citation data for bibliographic entities represented with different identifiers, therefore potentially representing same citation, a deduplication mechanism has been implemented.This ensures that citations integrated into OpenCitations Index are accurately identified uniquely, even when different identifiers are used.This mechanism follows a specific workflow, which encompasses a preprocessing of the original source data, a management of the provided bibliographic metadata, and the generation of new citation data to be integrated into the OpenCitations Index.The process relies on another data collection: OpenCitations Meta, and on the use of a new globally persistent identifier, namely OMID (OpenCitations Meta Identifier).As of July 2024, OpenCitations Index stores over 2 billion unique citation links, harvest from Crossref, the National Institute of Heath Open Citation Collection (NIH-OCC), DataCite, OpenAIRE, and the Japan Link Center (JaLC).OpenCitations Index can be systematically accessed and queried through several services, including SPARQL endpoint, REST APIs, and web interfaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, dataset dumps are available for free download and reuse (under CC0 waiver) in various formats (CSV, N-Triples, and Scholix), including provenance and change tracking information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.956</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) involves several clients that share with a fusion center (FC), the model each client has trained with its own data.Conventional FL, which can be interpreted as an estimation or distortion-based approach, ignores the final use of model information (MI) by the FC and the other clients.In this paper, we introduce a novel FL framework in which the FC uses an aggregate version of the MI to make decisions that affect the client's utility functions.Clients cannot choose the decisions and can only use the MI reported to the FC to maximize their utility.Depending on the alignment between the client and FC utilities, the client may have an individual interest in adding strategic noise to the model.This general framework is stated and specialized to the case of clustering, in which noisy cluster representative information is reported.This is applied to the problem of power consumption scheduling.In this context, utility non-alignment occurs, for instance, when the client wants to consume when the price of electricity is low, whereas the FC wants the consumption to occur when the total power is the lowest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is illustrated with aggregated real data from Ausgrid \cite{ausgrid}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Our numerical analysis clearly shows that the client can increase his utility by adding noise to the model reported to the FC.Corresponding results and source codes can be downloaded from \cite{source-code}.</p>

                  <p>Technological advances facilitate the ability to acquire multimodal data, posing a challenge for recognition systems while also providing an opportunity to use the heterogeneous nature of the information to increase the generalization capability of models.An often overlooked issue is the cost of the labeling process, which is typically high due to the need for a significant investment in time and money associated with human experts.Existing semi-supervised learning methods often focus on operating in the feature space created by the fusion of available modalities, neglecting the potential for cross-utilizing complementary information available in each modality.To address this problem, we propose Cross-Modality Clustering-based Self-Labeling (CMCSL).Based on a small set of pre-labeled data, CMCSL groups instances belonging to each modality in the deep feature space and then propagates known labels within the resulting clusters.Next, information about the instances' class membership in each modality is exchanged based on the Euclidean distance to ensure more accurate labeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluation conducted on 20 datasets derived from the MM-IMDb dataset indicates that cross-propagation of labels between modalities -- especially when the number of pre-labeled instances is small -- can allow for more reliable labeling and thus increase the classification performance in each modality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models have become cornerstone technologies, driving innovation in diverse fields from art creation to healthcare.Despite their potential, these models face the significant challenge of data memorization, which poses risks to privacy and the integrity of generated content.Among various metrics of memorization detection, our study delves into the memorization scores calculated from encoder layer embeddings, which involves measuring distances between samples in the embedding spaces.Particularly, we find that the memorization scores calculated from layer embeddings of Vision Transformers (ViTs) show an notable trend - the latter (deeper) the layer, the less the memorization measured.It has been found that the memorization scores from the early layers' embeddings are more sensitive to low-level memorization (e.g. colors and simple patterns for an image), while those from the latter layers are more sensitive to high-level memorization (e.g. semantic meaning of an image).We also observe that, for a specific model architecture, its degree of memorization on different levels of information is unique.It can be viewed as an inherent property of the architecture.Building upon this insight, we introduce a unique fingerprinting methodology.This method capitalizes on the unique distributions of the memorization score across different layers of ViTs, providing a novel approach to identifying models involved in generating deepfakes and malicious content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach demonstrates a marked 30% enhancement in identification accuracy over existing baseline methods, offering a more effective tool for combating digital misinformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>Media bias is a multifaceted problem, leading to one-sided views and impacting decision-making.A way to address digital media bias is to detect and indicate it automatically through machine-learning methods.However, such detection is limited due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable training data.Human-in-the-loop-based feedback mechanisms have proven an effective way to facilitate the data-gathering process.Therefore, we introduce and test feedback mechanisms for the media bias domain, which we then implement on NewsUnfold, a news-reading web application to collect reader feedback on machine-generated bias highlights within online news articles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach augments dataset quality by significantly increasing inter-annotator agreement by 26.31% and improving classifier performance by 2.49%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>As the first human-in-the-loop application for media bias, the feedback mechanism shows that a user-centric approach to media bias data collection can return reliable data while being scalable and evaluated as easy to use.NewsUnfold demonstrates that feedback mechanisms are a promising strategy to reduce data collection expenses and continuously update datasets to changes in context.</p>

                  <p>Sparse estimation for Gaussian graphical models is a crucial technique for making the relationships among numerous observed variables more interpretable and quantifiable.Various methods have been proposed, including graphical lasso, which utilizes the $\ell_1$ norm as a regularization term, as well as methods employing non-convex regularization terms.However, most of these methods approximate the $\ell_0$ norm with convex functions.To estimate more accurate solutions, it is desirable to treat the $\ell_0$ norm directly as a regularization term.In this study, we formulate the sparse estimation problem for Gaussian graphical models using the $\ell_0$ norm and propose a method to solve this problem using the Difference of Convex functions Algorithm (DCA).Specifically, we convert the $\ell_0$ norm constraint into an equivalent largest-$K$ norm constraint, reformulate the constrained problem into a penalized form, and solve it using the DC algorithm (DCA).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we designed an algorithm that efficiently computes using graphical lasso. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results with synthetic data show that our method yields results that are equivalent to or better than existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Comparisons of model learning through cross-validation confirm that our method is particularly advantageous in selecting true edges.</p>

                  <p>Current language models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in text generation.However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language -- ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience.For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance.In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier -- however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives.In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties.Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier.</p>

                  <p>For decades, mainframe systems have been vital in enterprise computing, supporting essential applications across industries like banking, retail, and healthcare.To harness these legacy applications and facilitate their reuse, there is increasing interest in using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to expose their data and functionalities, enabling the creation of new applications.However, identifying and exposing APIs for various business use cases presents significant challenges, including understanding legacy code, separating dependent components, introducing new artifacts, and making changes without disrupting functionality or compromising key Service Level Agreements (SLAs) like Turnaround Time (TAT).   We address these challenges by proposing a novel framework for creating APIs for legacy mainframe applications.Our approach involves identifying APIs by compiling artifacts such as transactions, screens, control flow blocks, inter-microservice calls, business rules, and data accesses.We use static analyses like liveness and reaching definitions to traverse the code and automatically compute API signatures, which include request/response fields.   To evaluate our framework, we conducted a qualitative survey with nine mainframe developers, averaging 15 years of experience.This survey helped identify candidate APIs and estimate development time for coding these APIs on a public mainframe application, GENAPP, and two industry mainframe applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results showed that our framework effectively identified more candidate APIs and reduced implementation time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>The API signature computation is integrated into IBM Watsonx Code Assistant for Z Refactoring Assistant.We verified the correctness of the identified APIs by executing them on an IBM Z mainframe system, demonstrating the practical viability of our approach.</p>

                  <p>Recently, federated learning (FL) has achieved wide successes for diverse privacy-sensitive applications without sacrificing the sensitive private information of clients.However, the data quality of client datasets can not be guaranteed since corresponding annotations of different clients often contain complex label noise of varying degrees, which inevitably causes the performance degradation.Intuitively, the performance degradation is dominated by clients with higher noise rates since their trained models contain more misinformation from data, thus it is necessary to devise an effective optimization scheme to mitigate the negative impacts of these noisy clients.In this work, we propose a two-stage framework FedELC to tackle this complicated label noise issue.The first stage aims to guide the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise, while the second stage aims to correct the labels of noisy clients' data via an end-to-end label correction framework which is achieved by learning possible ground-truth labels of noisy clients' datasets via back propagation.We implement sixteen related methods and evaluate five datasets with three types of complicated label noise scenarios for a comprehensive comparison.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate our proposed framework achieves superior performance than its counterparts for different scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>Additionally, we effectively improve the data quality of detected noisy clients' local datasets with our label correction framework.The code is available at https://github.com/Sprinter1999/FedELC.</p>

                  <p>Performance evaluation plays a crucial role in the development life cycle of large language models (LLMs).It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement.Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks.However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data).To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a nearly optimal performance estimation for LLMs.AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection.Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks, with up to 38.83% improvement over previous SOTA.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, impressive performance of deep learning technology has been recognized in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR).Since a large amount of annotated data is required in this technique, it poses a trenchant challenge to the issue of obtaining a high recognition rate through less labeled data.To overcome this problem, inspired by the contrastive learning, we proposed a novel framework named Batch Instance Discrimination and Feature Clustering (BIDFC).In this framework, different from that of the objective of general contrastive learning methods, embedding distance between samples should be moderate because of the high similarity between samples in the SAR images.Consequently, our flexible framework is equipped with adjustable distance between embedding, which we term as weakly contrastive learning.Technically, instance labels are assigned to the unlabeled data in per batch and random augmentation and training are performed few times on these augmented data.Meanwhile, a novel Dynamic-Weighted Variance loss (DWV loss) function is also posed to cluster the embedding of enhanced versions for each sample.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) database indicate a 91.25% classification accuracy of our method fine-tuned on only 3.13% training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Even though a linear evaluation is performed on the same training data, the accuracy can still reach 90.13%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>We also verified the effectiveness of BIDFC in OpenSarShip database, indicating that our method can be generalized to other datasets.Our code is avaliable at: https://github.com/Wenlve-Zhou/BIDFC-master.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable progress in simulation environments, yet its application to real-world robotic tasks remains limited due to challenges in exploration and generalisation.To address these issues, we introduce NAVINACT, a framework that chooses when the robot should use classical motion planning-based navigation and when it should learn a policy.To further improve the efficiency in exploration, we use imitation data to bootstrap the exploration.NAVINACT dynamically switches between two modes of operation: navigating to a waypoint using classical techniques when away from the objects and reinforcement learning for fine-grained manipulation control when about to interact with objects.NAVINACT consists of a multi-head architecture composed of ModeNet for mode classification, NavNet for waypoint prediction, and InteractNet for precise manipulation.By combining the strengths of RL and Imitation Learning (IL), NAVINACT improves sample efficiency and mitigates distribution shift, ensuring robust task execution.We evaluate our approach across multiple challenging simulation environments and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance in terms of adaptability, efficiency, and generalization compared to existing methods.In both simulated and real-world settings, NAVINACT demonstrates robust performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In simulations, NAVINACT surpasses baseline methods by 10-15\% in training success rates at 30k samples and by 30-40\% during evaluation phases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In real-world scenarios, it demonstrates a 30-40\% higher success rate on simpler tasks compared to baselines and uniquely succeeds in complex, two-stage manipulation tasks.

                  <p>Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning paradigm that can effectively exploit large-scale data without exposing users' privacy.However, it may incur significant communication overhead, thereby potentially impairing the training efficiency.To address this challenge, numerous studies suggest binarizing the model updates.Nonetheless, traditional methods usually binarize model updates in a post-training manner, resulting in significant approximation errors and consequent degradation in model accuracy.To this end, we propose Federated Binarization-Aware Training (FedBAT), a novel framework that directly learns binary model updates during the local training process, thus inherently reducing the approximation errors.FedBAT incorporates an innovative binarization operator, along with meticulously designed derivatives to facilitate efficient learning.In addition, we establish theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence of FedBAT.Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that FedBAT significantly accelerates the convergence and exceeds the accuracy of baselines by up to 9\%, even surpassing that of FedAvg in some cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span></p>

                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have profoundly transformed the field of remote sensing, revolutionizing data collection, processing, and analysis.Traditionally reliant on manual interpretation and task-specific models, remote sensing has been significantly enhanced by the advent of foundation models--large-scale, pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide array of tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.This paper provides a comprehensive survey of foundation models in the remote sensing domain, covering models released between June 2021 and June 2024.We categorize these models based on their applications in computer vision and domain-specific tasks, offering insights into their architectures, pre-training datasets, and methodologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through detailed performance comparisons, we highlight emerging trends and the significant advancements achieved by these foundation models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>Additionally, we discuss the technical challenges, practical implications, and future research directions, addressing the need for high-quality data, computational resources, and improved model generalization.Our research also finds that pre-training methods, particularly self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders, significantly enhance the performance and robustness of foundation models in remote sensing tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and other applications.This survey aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners by providing a panorama of advances and promising pathways for continued development and application of foundation models in remote sensing.</p>

                  <p>Context: IoT systems, networks of connected devices powered by software, require studying software quality for maintenance.Despite extensive studies on non-IoT software quality, research on IoT software quality is lacking.It is uncertain if IoT and non-IoT systems software are comparable, hindering the confident application of results and best practices gained on non-IoT systems.   Objective:Therefore, we compare the code quality of two equivalent sets of IoT and non-IoT systems to determine whether there are similarities and differences.We also collect and revisit software-engineering best practices in non-IoT contexts to apply them to IoT.   Method: We design and apply a systematic method to select two sets of 94 non-IoT and IoT systems software from GitHub with comparable characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compute quality metrics on the systems in these two sets and then analyse and compare the metric values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We analyse in depth and provide specific examples of IoT system's complexity and how it manifests in the codebases.After the comparison, We systematically select and present a list of best practices to address the observed difference between IoT and non-IoT code.   Results: Through a comparison of metrics, we conclude that software for IoT systems is more complex, coupled, larger, less maintainable, and cohesive than non-IoT systems.Several factors, such as integrating multiple hardware and software components and managing data communication between them, contribute to these differences.Considering these differences, we present a revisited best practices list with approaches, tools, or techniques for developing IoT systems.As example, applying modularity, and refactoring are best practices for lowering the complexity.   Conclusion: Based on our work, researchers can now make an informed decision using existing studies on the quality of non-IoT systems for IoT systems.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in graph machine learning, a field rapidly advancing yet grappling with the discrepancy between source and target data distributions.Traditional graph learning algorithms, based on the assumption of uniform distribution between training and test data, falter in real-world scenarios where this assumption fails, resulting in suboptimal performance.A principal factor contributing to this suboptimal performance is the inherent simplicity bias of neural networks trained through Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which prefer simpler features over more complex yet equally or more predictive ones.This bias leads to a reliance on spurious correlations, adversely affecting OOD performance in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language understanding, and graph classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Current methodologies, including subgraph-mixup and information bottleneck approaches, have achieved partial success but struggle to overcome simplicity bias, often reinforcing spurious correlations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>To tackle this, we propose DIVE, training a collection of models to focus on all label-predictive subgraphs by encouraging the models to foster divergence on the subgraph mask, which circumvents the limitation of a model solely focusing on the subgraph corresponding to simple structural patterns.Specifically, we employs a regularizer to punish overlap in extracted subgraphs across models, thereby encouraging different models to concentrate on distinct structural patterns.Model selection for robust OOD performance is achieved through validation accuracy.Tested across four datasets from GOOD benchmark and one dataset from DrugOOD benchmark, our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, effectively addressing the simplicity bias and enhancing generalization in graph machine learning.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely adopted to mitigate data sparsity and address cold-start issues in recommender systems.While existing KGs-based recommendation methods can predict user preferences and demands, they fall short in generating explicit recommendation paths and lack explainability.As a step beyond the above methods, recent advancements utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to find suitable items for a given user via explainable recommendation paths.However, the performance of these solutions is still limited by the following two points.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(1) Lack of ability to capture contextual dependencies from neighboring information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>(2) The excessive reliance on short recommendation paths due to efficiency concerns.To surmount these challenges, we propose a category-aware dual-agent reinforcement learning (CADRL) model for explainable recommendations over KGs.Specifically, our model comprises two components: (1) a category-aware gated graph neural network that jointly captures context-aware item representations from neighboring entities and categories, and (2) a dual-agent RL framework where two agents efficiently traverse long paths to search for suitable items.Finally, experimental results show that CADRL outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.</p>

                  <p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field of study that focuses on identifying and classifying human activities.Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has received much attention in recent years, where Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method is widely used and has achieved remarkable results.However, the representation of skeleton data and the issue of over-smoothing in GCN still need to be studied.1).Compared to central nodes, edge nodes can only aggregate limited neighbor information, and different edge nodes of the human body are always structurally related.However, the information from edge nodes is crucial for fine-grained activity recognition.2).The Graph Convolutional Network suffers from a significant over-smoothing issue, causing nodes to become increasingly similar as the number of network layers increases.Based on these two ideas, we propose a two-stream graph convolution method called Spatial-Structural GCN (SpSt-GCN).Spatial GCN performs information aggregation based on the topological structure of the human body, and structural GCN performs differentiation based on the similarity of edge node sequences.The spatial connection is fixed, and the human skeleton naturally maintains this topology regardless of the actions performed by humans.However, the structural connection is dynamic and depends on the type of movement the human body is performing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this idea, we also propose an entirely data-driven structural connection, which greatly increases flexibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>We evaluate our method on two large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120.The proposed method achieves good results while being efficient.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Creating data stories from raw data is challenging due to humans' limited attention spans and the need for specialized skills.Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer great opportunities to develop systems with autonomous agents to streamline the data storytelling workflow.Though multi-agent systems have benefits such as fully realizing LLM potentials with decomposed tasks for individual agents, designing such systems also faces challenges in task decomposition, performance optimization for sub-tasks, and workflow design.To better understand these issues, we develop Data Director, an LLM-based multi-agent system designed to automate the creation of animated data videos, a representative genre of data stories.Data Director interprets raw data, breaks down tasks, designs agent roles to make informed decisions automatically, and seamlessly integrates diverse components of data videos.A case study demonstrates Data Director's effectiveness in generating data videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Throughout development, we have derived lessons learned from addressing challenges, guiding further advancements in autonomous agents for data storytelling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>We also shed light on future directions for global optimization, human-in-the-loop design, and the application of advanced multi-modal LLMs.</p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the challenge of perceiving complete object shapes through visual perception.While prior studies have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in segmenting the visible parts of objects within a scene, amodal segmentation, in particular, has the potential to allow robots to infer the occluded parts of objects.To this end, this paper introduces a new framework that explores amodal segmentation for robotic grasping in cluttered scenes, thus greatly enhancing robotic grasping abilities.Initially, we use a conventional segmentation algorithm to detect the visible segments of the target object, which provides shape priors for completing the full object mask.Particularly, to explore how to utilize semantic features from RGB images and geometric information from depth images, we propose a Linear-fusion Attention-guided Convolutional Network (LAC-Net).LAC-Net utilizes the linear-fusion strategy to effectively fuse this cross-modal data, and then uses the prior visible mask as attention map to guide the network to focus on target feature locations for further complete mask recovery.Using the amodal mask of the target object provides advantages in selecting more accurate and robust grasp points compared to relying solely on the visible segments.The results on different datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the robot experiments validate the feasibility and robustness of this method in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Our code and demonstrations are available on the project page: https://jrryzh.github.io/LAC-Net.</p>
