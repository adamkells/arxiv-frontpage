In this paper, we develop a set of technical requirements for anonymization rules and related regulations.The requirements are derived by situating within a simple abstract model of data processing a set of guiding general principles put forth in prior work.We describe an approach to evaluating such regulations using these requirements -- thus enabling the application of the general principles for the design of mechanisms.As an exemplar, we evaluate competing interpretations of regulatory requirements from the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench.With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0.To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult.Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.   The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.</p>

                  <p>Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation.Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area.Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering.However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views.In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did.We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span></p>

This was later improved to $O(\text{nnz}(A) + d^\omega)$ by [Song, Yang, Yang, Zhou 2022], where $\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of nonzero entries of $A$ and $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.Currently $\omega \approx 2.371$<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Alman, Duan, Williams, Xu, Xu, Zhou 2024]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>In this work, we present the first quantum algorithm that computes the John ellipsoid utilizing recent advances in quantum algorithms for spectral approximation and leverage score approximation, running in $O(\sqrt{n}d^{1.5} + d^\omega)$ time.In the tall matrix regime, our algorithm achieves quadratic speedup, resulting in a sublinear running time and significantly outperforming the current best classical algorithms.</p>

                  <p>In their pioneering work, Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones (SICOMP 2020) introduced locality-sensitive ordering (LSO), and constructed an LSO with a constant number of orderings for point sets in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space.Furthermore, their LSO could be made dynamic effortlessly under point insertions and deletions, taking $O(\log{n})$ time per update by exploiting Euclidean geometry.Their LSO provides a powerful primitive to solve a host of geometric problems in both dynamic and static settings.Filtser and Le (STOC 2022) constructed the first LSO with a constant number of orderings in the more general setting of doubling metrics.However, their algorithm is inherently static since it relies on several sophisticated constructions in intermediate steps, none of which is known to have a dynamic version.Making their LSO dynamic would recover the full generality of LSO and provide a general tool to dynamize a vast number of static constructions in doubling metrics.   In this work, we give a dynamic algorithm that has $O(\log{n})$ time per update to construct an LSO in doubling metrics under point insertions and deletions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a toolkit of several new data structures: a pairwise tree cover, a net tree cover, and a leaf tracker. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>A key technical is stabilizing the dynamic net tree of Cole and Gottlieb (STOC 2006), a central dynamic data structure in doubling metrics.Specifically, we show that every update to the dynamic net tree can be decomposed into a few simple updates to trees in the net tree cover.As stability is the key to any dynamic algorithm, our technique could be useful for other problems in doubling metrics.   We obtain several algorithmic applications from our dynamic LSO.The most notably is the first dynamic algorithm for maintaining an $k$-fault tolerant spanner in doubling metrics with optimal sparsity in optimal $O(\log{n})$ time per update.</p>

                  <p>LiDAR sensors are crucial for providing high-resolution 3D point cloud data in autonomous driving systems, enabling precise environmental perception.However, real-world adverse weather conditions, such as rain, fog, and snow, introduce significant noise and interference, degrading the reliability of LiDAR data and the performance of downstream tasks like semantic segmentation.Existing datasets often suffer from limited weather diversity and small dataset sizes, which restrict their effectiveness in training models.Additionally, current deep learning denoising methods, while effective in certain scenarios, often lack interpretability, complicating the ability to understand and validate their decision-making processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these limitations, we introduce two large-scale datasets, Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes, which cover three common adverse weather conditions: rain, fog, and snow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>These datasets retain the original LiDAR acquisition information and provide point-level semantic labels for rain, fog, and snow.Furthermore, we propose a novel point cloud denoising model, TripleMixer, comprising three mixer layers: the Geometry Mixer Layer, the Frequency Mixer Layer, and the Channel Mixer Layer.These layers are designed to capture geometric spatial information, extract multi-scale frequency information, and enhance the multi-channel feature information of point clouds, respectively.Experiments conducted on the WADS dataset in real-world scenarios, as well as on our proposed Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes datasets, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance.Additionally, our experiments show that integrating the denoising model into existing segmentation frameworks enhances the performance of downstream tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Grandzxw/TripleMixer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.908</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce Scribbles for All, a label and training data generation algorithm for semantic segmentation trained on scribble labels.Training or fine-tuning semantic segmentation models with weak supervision has become an important topic recently and was subject to significant advances in model quality.In this setting, scribbles are a promising label type to achieve high quality segmentation results while requiring a much lower annotation effort than usual pixel-wise dense semantic segmentation annotations.The main limitation of scribbles as source for weak supervision is the lack of challenging datasets for scribble segmentation, which hinders the development of novel methods and conclusive evaluations.To overcome this limitation, Scribbles for All provides scribble labels for several popular segmentation datasets and provides an algorithm to automatically generate scribble labels for any dataset with dense annotations, paving the way for new insights and model advancements in the field of weakly supervised segmentation.In addition to providing datasets and algorithm, we evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation models on our datasets and show that models trained with our synthetic labels perform competitively with respect to models trained on manual labels.Thus, our datasets enable state-of-the-art research into methods for scribble-labeled semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets, scribble generation algorithm, and baselines are publicly available at https://github.com/wbkit/Scribbles4All <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.884</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is critical in surveillance systems and patrol robots by identifying anomalous regions in images for early warning.Depending on whether reference data are utilized, anomaly detection can be categorized into anomaly detection with reference and anomaly detection without reference.Currently, anomaly detection without reference, which is closely related to out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection, struggles with learning anomalous patterns due to the difficulty of collecting sufficiently large and diverse anomaly datasets with the inherent rarity and novelty of anomalies.Alternatively, anomaly detection with reference employs the scheme of change detection to identify anomalies by comparing semantic changes between a reference image and a query one.However, there are very few ADr works due to the scarcity of public datasets in this domain.In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing the UMAD Benchmark Dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our best knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset designed specifically for anomaly detection with reference in robotic patrolling scenarios, e.g., where an autonomous robot is employed to detect anomalous objects by comparing a reference and a query video sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>The reference sequences can be taken by the robot along a specified route when there are no anomalous objects in the scene.The query sequences are captured online by the robot when it is patrolling in the same scene following the same route.Our benchmark dataset is elaborated such that each query image can find a corresponding reference based on accurate robot localization along the same route in the prebuilt 3D map, with which the reference and query images can be geometrically aligned using adaptive warping.Besides the proposed benchmark dataset, we evaluate the baseline models of ADr on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data.However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals.There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification.Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information.In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process.This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability.Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL).Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance.We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification.The code will be made available after publication.</p>

On the same platform, we estimate an energy cost for on-device training 10x lower than the labeling energy if sampling a new utterance every 5 s or 16.4 s with a DS-CNN-S or a DS-CNN-M model.Our empirical result paves the way to self-adaptive personalized KWS sensors at the extreme edge.</p>

However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists.In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources.We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region.Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners.Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator.The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.Additional details along with the dataset links and codes are available at $\href{https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/cracks-crowdsourcing-resources-for-analysis-and-categorization-of-key-subsurface-faults/}{link}$.</p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>While machine learning models have proven effective across various scenarios, it is widely acknowledged that many models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.Recently, there have emerged numerous efforts in adversarial defense.Among them, certified defense is well known for its theoretical guarantees against arbitrary adversarial perturbations on input within a certain range (e.g., $l_2$ ball).However, most existing works in this line struggle to generalize their certified robustness in other data domains with distribution shifts.This issue is rooted in the difficulty of eliminating the negative impact of spurious correlations on robustness in different domains.To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel certified defense framework GLEAN, which incorporates a causal perspective into the generalization problem in certified defense.More specifically, our framework integrates a certifiable causal factor learning component to disentangle the causal relations and spurious correlations between input and label, and thereby exclude the negative effect of spurious correlations on defense.On top of that, we design a causally certified defense strategy to handle adversarial attacks on latent causal factors.In this way, our framework is not only robust against malicious noises on data in the training distribution but also can generalize its robustness across domains with distribution shifts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our framework in certified robustness generalization in different data domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Code is available in the supplementary materials.</p>

                  <p>As the field of artificial intelligence progresses, assistive technologies are becoming more widely used across all industries.The healthcare industry is no different, with numerous studies being done to develop assistive tools for healthcare professionals.Automatic diagnostic systems are one such beneficial tool that can assist with a variety of tasks, including collecting patient information, analyzing test results, and diagnosing patients.However, the idea of developing systems that can provide a differential diagnosis has been largely overlooked in most of these research studies.In this study, we propose a transformer-based approach for providing differential diagnoses based on a patient's age, sex, medical history, and symptoms.We use the DDXPlus dataset, which provides differential diagnosis information for patients based on 49 disease types.Firstly, we propose a method to process the tabular patient data from the dataset and engineer them into patient reports to make them suitable for our research.In addition, we introduce two data modification modules to diversify the training data and consequently improve the robustness of the models.We approach the task as a multi-label classification problem and conduct extensive experiments using four transformer models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the models displayed promising results by achieving over 97% F1 score on the held-out test set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Moreover, we design additional behavioral tests to get a broader understanding of the models.In particular, for one of our test cases, we prepared a custom test set of 100 samples with the assistance of a doctor.The results on the custom set showed that our proposed data modification modules improved the model's generalization capabilities.We hope our findings will provide future researchers with valuable insights and inspire them to develop reliable systems for automatic differential diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>Acoustic scene classification (ASC) predominantly relies on supervised approaches.However, acquiring labeled data for training ASC models is often costly and time-consuming.Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful method for extracting features from unlabeled audio data, benefiting many downstream audio tasks.This paper proposes a data-efficient and low-complexity ASC system by leveraging self-supervised audio representations extracted from general-purpose audio datasets.We introduce BEATs, an audio SSL pre-trained model, to extract the general representations from AudioSet.Through extensive experiments, it has been demonstrated that the self-supervised audio representations can help to achieve high ASC accuracy with limited labeled fine-tuning data.Furthermore, we find that ensembling the SSL models fine-tuned with different strategies contributes to a further performance improvement.To meet low-complexity requirements, we use knowledge distillation to transfer the self-supervised knowledge from large teacher models to an efficient student model.The experimental results suggest that the self-supervised teachers effectively improve the classification accuracy of the student model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our best-performing system obtains an average accuracy of 56.7%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies investigated the challenge of assessing the strength of a given claim extracted from a dataset, particularly the claim's potential of being misleading and cherry-picked.We focus on claims that compare answers to an aggregate query posed on a view that selects tuples.The strength of a claim amounts to the question of how likely it is that the view is carefully chosen to support the claim, whereas less careful choices would lead to contradictory claims.We embark on the study of the reverse task that offers a complementary angle in the critical assessment of data-based claims: given a claim, find useful supporting views.The goal of this task is twofold.On the one hand, we aim to assist users in finding significant evidence of phenomena of interest.On the other hand, we wish to provide them with machinery to criticize or counter given claims by extracting evidence of opposing statements.   To be effective, the supporting sub-population should be significant and defined by a ``natural'' view.We discuss several measures of naturalness and propose ways of extracting the best views under each measure (and combinations thereof).The main challenge is the computational cost, as na\"ive search is infeasible.We devise anytime algorithms that deploy two main steps: (1) a preliminary construction of a ranked list of attribute combinations that are assessed using fast-to-compute features, and (2) an efficient search for the actual views based on each attribute combination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a thorough experimental study that shows the effectiveness of our algorithms in terms of quality and execution cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>We also present a user study to assess the usefulness of the naturalness measures.</p>

                  <p>Even in the era of large models, one of the well-known issues in continual learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, which is significantly challenging when the continual data stream exhibits a long-tailed distribution, termed as Long-Tailed Continual Learning (LTCL).Existing LTCL solutions generally require the label distribution of the data stream to achieve re-balance training.However, obtaining such prior information is often infeasible in real scenarios since the model should learn without pre-identifying the majority and minority classes.To this end, we propose a novel Prior-free Balanced Replay (PBR) framework to learn from long-tailed data stream with less forgetting.Concretely, motivated by our experimental finding that the minority classes are more likely to be forgotten due to the higher uncertainty, we newly design an uncertainty-guided reservoir sampling strategy to prioritize rehearsing minority data without using any prior information, which is based on the mutual dependence between the model and samples.Additionally, we incorporate two prior-free components to further reduce the forgetting issue: (1) Boundary constraint is to preserve uncertain boundary supporting samples for continually re-estimating task boundaries.(2) Prototype constraint is to maintain the consistency of learned class prototypes along with training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is evaluated on three standard long-tailed benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance to existing CL methods and previous SOTA LTCL approach in both task- and class-incremental learning settings, as well as ordered- and shuffled-LTCL settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address issues of overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in the paradigm of self-supervised learning.Mainstream methods based on PEFT involve adding a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained parameters of the backbone fixed.These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone.Despite its success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization.We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity.Motivated by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework based on Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP).The target parameters refer to the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning.TPP includes an additional stage before PEFT to pre-train these target parameters.During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the target parameters are trainable.A defined pre-text task is used to encourage the target parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data.When PEFT is subsequently employed, the pre-trained target parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency.The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing for the integration of various pretext tasks for pre-training and supporting different PEFT methods as backbones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated the fine-tining performance of our method using five public datasets, including three modalities and two task types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>The results demonstrate that the proposed TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance.</p>

                  <p>Occlusion boundaries (OBs) geometrically localize the occlusion events in a 2D image, and contain useful information for addressing various scene understanding problems.To advance their study, we have led the investigation in the following three aspects.Firstly, we have studied interactive estimation of OBs, which is the first in the literature, and proposed an efficient deep-network-based method using multiple-scribble intervention, named DNMMSI, which significantly improves the performance over the state-of-the-art fully-automatic methods.Secondly, we propose to exploit the synthetic benchmark for the training process, thanks to the particularity that OBs are determined geometrically and unambiguously from the 3D scene.To this end, we have developed an efficient tool, named Mesh2OB, for the automatic generation of 2D images together with their ground-truth OBs, using which we have constructed a synthetic benchmark, named OB-FUTURE.Abundant experimental results demonstrate that leveraging such a synthetic benchmark for training achieves promising performance, even without the use of domain adaptation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, to achieve a more compelling and robust evaluation in OB-related research, we have created a real benchmark, named OB-LabName, consisting of 120 high-resolution images together with their ground-truth OBs, with precision surpassing that of previous benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We will release DNMMSI with pre-trained parameters, Mesh2OB, OB-FUTURE, and OB-LabName to support further research.</p>

In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance.First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation.Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout.Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN.This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts.Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p>

                  <p>Causality is vital for understanding true cause-and-effect relationships between variables within predictive models, rather than relying on mere correlations, making it highly relevant in the field of Explainable AI.In an automated decision-making scenario, causal inference methods can analyze the underlying data-generation process, enabling explanations of a model's decision by manipulating features and creating counterfactual examples.These counterfactuals explore hypothetical scenarios where a minimal number of factors are altered, providing end-users with valuable information on how to change their situation.However, interpreting a set of multiple counterfactuals can be challenging for end-users who are not used to analyzing raw data records.In our work, we propose a novel multi-step pipeline that uses counterfactuals to generate natural language explanations of actions that will lead to a change in outcome in classifiers of tabular data using LLMs.This pipeline is designed to guide the LLM through smaller tasks that mimic human reasoning when explaining a decision based on counterfactual cases.We conducted various experiments using a public dataset and proposed a method of closed-loop evaluation to assess the coherence of the final explanation with the counterfactuals, as well as the quality of the content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results are promising, although further experiments with other datasets and human evaluations should be carried out. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate a variant of the classical stochastic Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problem, where the payoff received by an agent (either cost or reward) is both delayed, and directly corresponds to the magnitude of the delay.This setting models faithfully many real world scenarios such as the time it takes for a data packet to traverse a network given a choice of route (where delay serves as the agent's cost); or a user's time spent on a web page given a choice of content (where delay serves as the agent's reward).   Our main contributions are tight upper and lower bounds for both the cost and reward settings.For the case that delays serve as costs, which we are the first to consider, we prove optimal regret that scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\logT}{\Delta_i} + d^*$, where $T$ is the maximal number of steps, $\Delta_i$ are the sub-optimality gaps and $d^*$ is the minimal expected delay amongst arms.For the case that delays serves as rewards, we show optimal regret of $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + \bar{d}$, where $\bar d$ is the second maximal expected delay.These improve over the regret in the general delay-dependent payoff setting, which scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + D$, where $D$ is the maximum possible delay.Our regret bounds highlight the difference between the cost and reward scenarios, showing that the improvement in the cost scenario is more significant than for the reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we accompany our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) can be coordinated under the orchestration of a central server to collaboratively build a privacy-preserving model without the need for data exchange.However, participant data heterogeneity leads to local optima divergence, subsequently affecting convergence outcomes.Recent research has focused on global sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and dynamic regularization techniques to enhance consistency between global and local generalization and optimization objectives.Nonetheless, the estimation of global SAM introduces additional computational and memory overhead, while dynamic regularization suffers from bias in the local and global dual variables due to training isolation.In this paper, we propose a novel FL algorithm, FedTOGA, designed to consider optimization and generalization objectives while maintaining minimal uplink communication overhead.By linking local perturbations to global updates, global generalization consistency is improved.Additionally, global updates are used to correct local dynamic regularizers, reducing dual variables bias and enhancing optimization consistency.Global updates are passively received by clients, reducing overhead.We also propose neighborhood perturbation to approximate local perturbation, analyzing its strengths and limitations.Theoretical analysis shows FedTOGA achieves faster convergence $O(1/T)$ under non-convex functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical studies demonstrate that FedTOGA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 1\% accuracy increase and 30\% faster convergence, achieving state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

Our findings do not only advance the current theoretical understanding of uncertainties over latent variables, but also facilitate the access to uncertainty quantification for future researchers inside and outside the field, enabling straightforward but trustworthy machine learning.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the only non-invasive tool for studying white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the brain.These assessments rely heavily on tractography techniques, which reconstruct virtual streamlines representing white matter fibers.Much effort has been devoted to improving tractography methodology for adult brains, while tractography of the fetal brain has been largely neglected.Fetal tractography faces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly developing brain structures, and paucity of reference data.This work presents the first machine learning model for fetal tractography.The model input consists of five sources of information: (1) Fiber orientation, inferred from a diffusion tensor fit to the dMRI signal; (2) Directions of recent propagation steps; (3) Global spatial information, encoded as distances to keypoints in the brain cortex; (4) Tissue segmentation information; and (5) Prior information about the expected local fiber orientations supplied with an atlas.In order to mitigate the local tensor estimation error, a large spatial context around the current point in the diffusion tensor image is encoded using convolutional and attention neural network modules.Moreover, the diffusion tensor information at a hypothetical next point is included in the model input.Filtering rules based on anatomically constrained tractography are applied to prune implausible streamlines.We trained the model on manually-refined whole-brain fetal tractograms and validated the trained model on an independent set of 11 test scans with gestational ages between 23 and 36 weeks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance across all evaluated tracts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>The new method can significantly advance the capabilities of dMRI for studying normal and abnormal brain development in utero.</p>

                  <p>Data augmentation is widely used for training a neural network given little labeled data.A common practice of augmentation training is applying a composition of multiple transformations sequentially to the data.Existing augmentation methods such as RandAugment randomly sample from a list of pre-selected transformations, while methods such as AutoAugment apply advanced search to optimize over an augmentation set of size $k^d$, which is the number of transformation sequences of length $d$, given a list of $k$ transformations.   In this paper, we design efficient algorithms whose running time complexity is much faster than the worst-case complexity of $O(k^d)$, provably.We propose a new algorithm to search for a binary tree-structured composition of $k$ transformations, where each tree node corresponds to one transformation.The binary tree generalizes sequential augmentations, such as the SimCLR augmentation scheme for contrastive learning.Using a top-down, recursive search procedure, our algorithm achieves a runtime complexity of $O(2^d k)$, which is much faster than $O(k^d)$ as $k$ increases above $2$. We apply our algorithm to tackle data distributions with heterogeneous subpopulations by searching for one tree in each subpopulation and then learning a weighted combination, resulting in a forest of trees.   We validate our proposed algorithms on numerous graph and image datasets, including a multi-label graph classification dataset we collected.The dataset exhibits significant variations in the sizes of graphs and their average degrees, making it ideal for studying data augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our approach can reduce the computation cost by 43% over existing search methods while improving performance by 4.3%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>The tree structures can be used to interpret the relative importance of each transformation, such as identifying the important transformations on small vs. large graphs.</p>

                  <p>With increasing privacy concerns in artificial intelligence, regulations have mandated the right to be forgotten, granting individuals the right to withdraw their data from models.Machine unlearning has emerged as a potential solution to enable selective forgetting in models, particularly in recommender systems where historical data contains sensitive user information.Despite recent advances in recommendation unlearning, evaluating unlearning methods comprehensively remains challenging due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework and overlooked aspects of deeper influence, e.g., fairness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these gaps, we propose CURE4Rec, the first comprehensive benchmark for recommendation unlearning evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>CURE4Rec covers four aspects, i.e., unlearning Completeness, recommendation Utility, unleaRning efficiency, and recommendation fairnEss, under three data selection strategies, i.e., core data, edge data, and random data.Specifically, we consider the deeper influence of unlearning on recommendation fairness and robustness towards data with varying impact levels.We construct multiple datasets with CURE4Rec evaluation and conduct extensive experiments on existing recommendation unlearning methods.Our code is released at https://github.com/xiye7lai/CURE4Rec.</p>

In this work, we give a dynamic algorithm that has $O(\log{n})$ time per update to construct an LSO in doubling metrics under point insertions and deletions.We introduce a toolkit of several new data structures: a pairwise tree cover, a net tree cover, and a leaf tracker.A key technical is stabilizing the dynamic net tree of Cole and Gottlieb (STOC 2006), a central dynamic data structure in doubling metrics.Specifically, we show that every update to the dynamic net tree can be decomposed into a few simple updates to trees in the net tree cover.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As stability is the key to any dynamic algorithm, our technique could be useful for other problems in doubling metrics.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We obtain several algorithmic applications from our dynamic LSO.The most notably is the first dynamic algorithm for maintaining an $k$-fault tolerant spanner in doubling metrics with optimal sparsity in optimal $O(\log{n})$ time per update.</p>

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level.Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>Recently many deep learning models have been proposed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF).Based on previous literature, we identify three critical patterns that can improve forecasting accuracy: the order and semantic dependencies in time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency.However, little effort has been made to simultaneously consider order and semantic dependencies when developing forecasting models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing approaches utilize cross-variate dependency by mixing information from different timestamps and variates, which may introduce irrelevant or harmful cross-variate information to the time dimension and largely hinder forecasting performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>To overcome these limitations, we investigate the potential of Mamba for LTSF and discover two key advantages benefiting forecasting: (i) the selection mechanism makes Mamba focus on or ignore specific inputs and learn semantic dependency easily, and (ii) Mamba preserves order dependency by processing sequences recursively.After that, we empirically find that the non-linear activation used in Mamba is unnecessary for semantically sparse time series data.Therefore, we further propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding.Specifically, we first remove the non-linearities of Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF.Furthermore, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with cross-variate dependency modeling capabilities while reducing the interference between time and variate dimensions.Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a new distillation method for extracting knowledge from Large Foundation Models (LFM) into lightweight models, introducing a novel supervision mode that does not require manually annotated data.While LFMs exhibit exceptional zero-shot classification abilities across datasets, relying solely on LFM-generated embeddings for distillation poses two main challenges: LFM's task-irrelevant knowledge and the high density of features.The transfer of task-irrelevant knowledge could compromise the student model's discriminative capabilities, and the high density of features within target domains obstructs the extraction of discriminative knowledge essential for the task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we introduce the Proxy Relational Graph (PRG) method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We initially extract task-relevant knowledge from LFMs by calculating a weighted average of logits obtained through text prompt embeddings.Then we construct sample-class proxy graphs for LFM and student models, respectively, to model the correlation between samples and class proxies.Then, we achieve the distillation of selective knowledge by aligning the relational graphs produced by both the LFM and the student model.Specifically, the distillation from LFM to the student model is achieved through two types of alignment: 1) aligning the sample nodes produced by the student model with those produced by the LFM, and 2) aligning the edge relationships in the student model's graph with those in the LFM's graph.Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of PRG, demonstrating its ability to leverage the extensive knowledge base of LFMs while skillfully circumventing their inherent limitations in focused learning scenarios.Notably, in our annotation-free framework, PRG achieves an accuracy of 76.23\% (T: 77.9\%) on CIFAR-100 and 72.44\% (T: 75.3\%) on the ImageNet-1K.</p>

                  <p>LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) demonstrates outstanding accuracy and stability in general low-speed and smooth motion scenarios.However, in high-speed and intense motion scenarios, such as sharp turns, two primary challenges arise: firstly, due to the limitations of IMU frequency, the error in estimating significantly non-linear motion states escalates; secondly, drastic changes in the Field of View (FOV) may diminish the spatial overlap between LiDAR frame and pointcloud map (or between frames), leading to insufficient data association and constraint degradation.   To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive Sliding window LIO framework (AS-LIO) guided by the Spatial Overlap Degree (SOD).Initially, we assess the SOD between the LiDAR frames and the registered map, directly evaluating the adverse impact of current FOV variation on pointcloud alignment.Subsequently, we design an adaptive sliding window to manage the continuous LiDAR stream and control state updates, dynamically adjusting the update step according to the SOD.This strategy enables our odometry to adaptively adopt higher update frequency to precisely characterize trajectory during aggressive FOV variation, thus effectively reducing the non-linear error in positioning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, the historical constraints within the sliding window reinforce the frame-to-map data association, ensuring the robustness of state estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Experiments show that our AS-LIO framework can quickly perceive and respond to challenging FOV change, outperforming other state-of-the-art LIO frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p>

                  <p>Understanding teachers' perspectives on AI in Education (AIEd) is crucial for its effective integration into the educational framework.This paper aims to explore how teachers currently use AI and how it can enhance the educational process.We conducted a cross-national study spanning Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Ireland, and Armenia, surveying 1754 educators through an online questionnaire, addressing three research questions.Our first research question examines educators' understanding of AIEd, their skepticism, and its integration within schools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most educators report a solid understanding of AI and acknowledge its potential risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.582</span></span>AIEd is primarily used for educator support and engaging students.However, concerns exist about AI's impact on fostering critical thinking and exposing students to biased data.The second research question investigates student engagement with AI tools from educators' perspectives.Teachers indicate that students use AI mainly to manage their academic workload, while outside school, AI tools are primarily used for entertainment.The third research question addresses future implications of AI in education.Educators are optimistic about AI's potential to enhance educational processes, particularly through personalized learning experiences.Nonetheless, they express significant concerns about AI's impact on cultivating critical thinking and ethical issues related to potential misuse.There is a strong emphasis on the need for professional development through training seminars, workshops, and online courses to integrate AI effectively into teaching practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the findings highlight a cautious optimism among educators regarding AI in education, alongside a clear demand for targeted professional development to address concerns and enhance skills in using AI tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human intelligence is characterized by our ability to absorb and apply knowledge from the world around us, especially in rapidly acquiring new concepts from minimal examples, underpinned by prior knowledge.Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to mimic this capacity by enabling significant generalizations and transferability.However, traditional FSL frameworks often rely on assumptions of clean, complete, and static data, conditions that are seldom met in real-world environments.Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world.This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings.We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions.Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.In conclusion, we outline potential future research directions for this evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is our hope that this review will catalyze further development of effective solutions to these complex challenges, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the evolution of machine learning techniques has significantly impacted the field of intrusion detection, particularly within the context of the Internet of Things (IoT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As IoT networks expand, the need for robust security measures to counteract potential threats has become increasingly critical. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>This paper introduces a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that synergistically combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with the XGBoost algorithm.Our proposed IDS leverages the unique capabilities of KANs, which utilize learnable activation functions to model complex relationships within data, alongside the powerful ensemble learning techniques of XGBoost, known for its high performance in classification tasks.This hybrid approach not only enhances the detection accuracy but also improves the interpretability of the model, making it suitable for dynamic and intricate IoT environments.Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our hybrid IDS achieves an impressive detection accuracy exceeding 99% in distinguishing between benign and malicious activities.Additionally, we were able to achieve F1 scores, precision, and recall that exceeded 98%.Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis against traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks, assessing performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score.The results underscore the efficacy of integrating KANs with XGBoost, highlighting the potential of this innovative approach to significantly strengthen the security framework of IoT networks.</p>
