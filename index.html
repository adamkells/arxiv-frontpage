                  <p>Purpose:Accurate tool segmentation is essential in computer-aided procedures.However, this task conveys challenges due to artifacts' presence and the limited training data in medical scenarios.Methods that generalize to unseen data represent an interesting venue, where zero-shot segmentation presents an option to account for data limitation.Initial exploratory works with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) show that bounding-box-based prompting presents notable zero-short generalization.However, point-based prompting leads to a degraded performance that further deteriorates under image corruption.We argue that SAM drastically over-segment images with high corruption levels, resulting in degraded performance when only a single segmentation mask is considered, while the combination of the masks overlapping the object of interest generates an accurate prediction.Method: We use SAM to generate the over-segmented prediction of endoscopic frames.Then, we employ the ground-truth tool mask to analyze the results of SAM when the best single mask is selected as prediction and when all the individual masks overlapping the object of interest are combined to obtain the final predicted mask.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the Endovis18 and Endovis17 instrument segmentation datasets using synthetic corruptions of various strengths and an In-House dataset featuring counterfactually created real-world corruptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.886</span></span>Results: Combining the over-segmented masks contributes to improvements in the IoU.Furthermore, selecting the best single segmentation presents a competitive IoU score for clean images.Conclusions: Combined SAM predictions present improved results and robustness up to a certain corruption level.However, appropriate prompting strategies are fundamental for implementing these models in the medical domain.</p>

                  <p>How can large language models (LLMs) process and translate endangered languages?Many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent LLM; therefore existing LLMs rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages.On the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary.We propose LINGOLLM, a training-free approach to enable an LLM to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre-training.Our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an LLM's prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text.We implement LINGOLLM on top of two models, GPT-4 and Mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages.Our results show that LINGOLLM elevates translation capability from GPT-4's 0 to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions.Our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of LLMs for endangered languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data, code, and model generations can be found at https://github.com/LLiLab/llm4endangeredlang. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Humans are known to structure social relationships according to certain patterns, such as the Ego Network Model (ENM).These patterns result from our innate cognitive limits and can therefore be observed in the vast majority of large human social groups.Until recently, the main focus of research was the structural characteristics of this model.The main aim of this paper is to complement previous findings with systematic and data-driven analyses on the positive and negative sentiments of social relationships, across different cultures, communities and topics of discussion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A total of 26 datasets were collected for this work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.979</span></span>It was found that contrary to previous findings, the influence of culture is not easily ``overwhelmed'' by that of the topic of discussion.However, more specific and polarising topics do lead to noticeable increases in negativity across all cultures.These negativities also appear to be stable across the different levels of the ENM, which contradicts previous hypotheses.Finally, the number of generic topics being discussed between users seems to be a good predictor of the overall positivity of their relationships.</p>

Image2Flow achieved excellent segmentation accuracy with a median Dice score of 0.9 (IQR: 0.86-0.92).The median node-wise normalized absolute error for pressure and velocity magnitude was 11.98% (IQR: 9.44-17.90%) and 8.06% (IQR: 7.54-10.41), respectively.Centerline analysis showed no significant difference between the Image2Flow and conventional CFD simulated on machine learning-generated volume-meshes.   This proof-of-concept study has shown it is possible to simultaneously perform patient specific volume-mesh based segmentation and pressure and flow field estimation.Image2Flow completes segmentation and CFD in ~205ms, which ~7000 times faster than manual methods, making it more feasible in a clinical environment.</p>

                  <p>We present a new distance oracle in the fully dynamic setting: given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and an arbitrary parameter $\epsilon$ where $1/\log^{c} n<\epsilon<1$ and $c>0$ is a small constant, we can deterministically maintain a data structure with $n^{\epsilon}$ worst-case update time that, given any pair of vertices $(u,v)$, returns a $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}$-approximate distance between $u$ and $v$ in ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)\log\log n$ query time.   Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects, both for fully dynamic algorithms and even decremental algorithms.First, no existing algorithm with worst-case update time guarantees a $o(n)$-approximation while also achieving an $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ update and $n^{o(1)}$ query time, while our algorithm offers a constant $O_{\epsilon}(1)$-approximation with $n^{\epsilon}$ update time and $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)$ query time.Second, even if amortized update time is allowed, it is the first deterministic constant-approximation algorithm with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ update and query time.The best result in this direction is the recent deterministic distance oracle by Chuzhoy and Zhang[STOC 2023] which achieves an approximation of $(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^{3})}}$ with amortized update time of $n^{\epsilon}$ and query time of $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}\log n\log\log n$.

                  <p>Food touches our lives through various endeavors, including flavor, nourishment, health, and sustainability.Recipes are cultural capsules transmitted across generations via unstructured text.Automated protocols for recognizing named entities, the building blocks of recipe text, are of immense value for various applications ranging from information extraction to novel recipe generation.Named entity recognition is a technique for extracting information from unstructured or semi-structured data with known labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Starting with manually-annotated data of 6,611 ingredient phrases, we created an augmented dataset of 26,445 phrases cumulatively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>Simultaneously, we systematically cleaned and analyzed ingredient phrases from RecipeDB, the gold-standard recipe data repository, and annotated them using the Stanford NER.Based on the analysis, we sampled a subset of 88,526 phrases using a clustering-based approach while preserving the diversity to create the machine-annotated dataset.A thorough investigation of NER approaches on these three datasets involving statistical, fine-tuning of deep learning-based language models and few-shot prompting on large language models (LLMs) provides deep insights.We conclude that few-shot prompting on LLMs has abysmal performance, whereas the fine-tuned spaCy-transformer emerges as the best model with macro-F1 scores of 95.9%, 96.04%, and 95.71% for the manually-annotated, augmented, and machine-annotated datasets, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Considering the limited internal parametric knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely used to extend the knowledge scope of large language models (LLMs).Despite the extensive efforts on RAG research, in existing methods, LLMs cannot precisely assess the relevance of retrieved documents, thus likely leading to misleading or even incorrect utilization of external knowledge (i.e., retrieved documents).To address this issue, in this paper, we propose REAR, a RElevance-Aware Retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering (QA).As the key motivation, we aim to enhance the self-awareness of source relevance for LLMs, so as to adaptively utilize external knowledge in RAG systems.Specially, we develop a new architecture for LLM based RAG system, by incorporating a specially designed rank head that precisely assesses the relevance of retrieved documents.Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training.By combining the improvements in both architecture and training, our proposed REAR can better utilize external knowledge by effectively perceiving the relevance of retrieved documents.Experiments on four open-domain QA tasks show that REAR significantly outperforms previous a number of competitive RAG approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/REAR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) effectively mitigates the data silo challenge brought about by policies and privacy concerns, implicitly harnessing more data for deep model training.However, traditional centralized FL models grapple with diverse multi-center data, especially in the face of significant data heterogeneity, notably in medical contexts.In the realm of medical image segmentation, the growing imperative to curtail annotation costs has amplified the importance of weakly-supervised techniques which utilize sparse annotations such as points, scribbles, etc.A pragmatic FL paradigm shall accommodate diverse annotation formats across different sites, which research topic remains under-investigated.In such context, we propose a novel personalized FL framework with learnable prompt and aggregation (FedLPPA) to uniformly leverage heterogeneous weak supervision for medical image segmentation.In FedLPPA, a learnable universal knowledge prompt is maintained, complemented by multiple learnable personalized data distribution prompts and prompts representing the supervision sparsity.Integrated with sample features through a dual-attention mechanism, those prompts empower each local task decoder to adeptly adjust to both the local distribution and the supervision form.Concurrently, a dual-decoder strategy, predicated on prompt similarity, is introduced for enhancing the generation of pseudo-labels in weakly-supervised learning, alleviating overfitting and noise accumulation inherent to local data, while an adaptable aggregation method is employed to customize the task decoder on a parameter-wise basis.Extensive experiments on three distinct medical image segmentation tasks involving different modalities underscore the superiority of FedLPPA, with its efficacy closely parallels that of fully supervised centralized training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions.There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments.To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments.LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration.We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration.We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent efforts have been dedicated to enhancing time series forecasting accuracy by introducing advanced network architectures and self-supervised pretraining strategies.Nevertheless, existing approaches still exhibit two critical drawbacks.Firstly, these methods often rely on a single dataset for training, limiting the model's generalizability due to the restricted scale of the training data.Secondly, the one-step generation schema is widely followed, which necessitates a customized forecasting head and overlooks the temporal dependencies in the output series, and also leads to increased training costs under different horizon length settings.   To address these issues, we propose a novel generative pretrained hierarchical transformer architecture for forecasting, named GPHT.There are two aspects of key designs in GPHT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the one hand, we advocate for constructing a mixed dataset for pretraining our model, comprising various datasets from diverse data scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>This approach significantly expands the scale of training data, allowing our model to uncover commonalities in time series data and facilitating improved transfer to specific datasets.On the other hand, GPHT employs an auto-regressive forecasting approach under the channel-independent assumption, effectively modeling temporal dependencies in the output series.Importantly, no customized forecasting head is required, enabling a single model to forecast at arbitrary horizon settings.We conduct sufficient experiments on eight datasets with mainstream self-supervised pretraining models and supervised models.The results demonstrated that GPHT surpasses the baseline models across various fine-tuning and zero/few-shot learning settings in the traditional long-term forecasting task, providing support for verifying the feasibility of pretrained time series large models.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across various domains; however, they exhibit a significant performance gap in Information Extraction (IE).Note that high-quality instruction data is the vital key for enhancing the specific capabilities of LLMs, while current IE datasets tend to be small in scale, fragmented, and lack standardized schema.To this end, we introduce IEPile, a comprehensive bilingual (English and Chinese) IE instruction corpus, which contains approximately 0.32B tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We construct IEPile by collecting and cleaning 33 existing IE datasets, and introduce schema-based instruction generation to unearth a large-scale corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>Experimental results on LLaMA and Baichuan demonstrate that using IEPile can enhance the performance of LLMs for IE, especially the zero-shot generalization.We open-source the resource and pre-trained models, hoping to provide valuable support to the NLP community.</p>

                  <p>Standard English and Malaysian English exhibit notable differences, posing challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks on Malaysian English.Unfortunately, most of the existing datasets are mainly based on standard English and therefore inadequate for improving NLP tasks in Malaysian English.An experiment using state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) solutions on Malaysian English news articles highlights that they cannot handle morphosyntactic variations in Malaysian English.To the best of our knowledge, there is no annotated dataset available to improvise the model.To address these issues, we constructed a Malaysian English News (MEN) dataset, which contains 200 news articles that are manually annotated with entities and relations.We then fine-tuned the spaCy NER tool and validated that having a dataset tailor-made for Malaysian English could improve the performance of NER in Malaysian English significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents our effort in the data acquisition, annotation methodology, and thorough analysis of the annotated dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate the quality of the annotation, inter-annotator agreement was used, followed by adjudication of disagreements by a subject matter expert. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Upon completion of these tasks, we managed to develop a dataset with 6,061 entities and 3,268 relation instances.Finally, we discuss on spaCy fine-tuning setup and analysis on the NER performance.This unique dataset will contribute significantly to the advancement of NLP research in Malaysian English, allowing researchers to accelerate their progress, particularly in NER and relation extraction.The dataset and annotation guideline has been published on Github.</p>

                  <p>Recently, influence functions present an apparatus for achieving explainability for deep neural models by quantifying the perturbation of individual train instances that might impact a test prediction.Our objectives in this paper are twofold.First we incorporate influence functions as a feedback into the model to improve its performance.Second, in a dataset extension exercise, using influence functions to automatically identify data points that have been initially `silver' annotated by some existing method and need to be cross-checked (and corrected) by annotators to improve the model performance.To meet these objectives, in this paper, we introduce InfFeed, which uses influence functions to compute the influential instances for a target instance.Toward the first objective, we adjust the label of the target instance based on its influencer(s) label.In doing this, InfFeed outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (including LLMs) by a maximum macro F1-score margin of almost 4% for hate speech classification, 3.5% for stance classification, and 3% for irony and 2% for sarcasm detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward the second objective we show that manually re-annotating only those silver annotated data points in the extension set that have a negative influence can immensely improve the model performance bringing it very close to the scenario where all the data points in the extension set have gold labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>This allows for huge reduction of the number of data points that need to be manually annotated since out of the silver annotated extension dataset, the influence function scheme picks up ~1/1000 points that need manual correction.</p>

                  <p>Out-of-distribution detection is a crucial technique for deploying machine learning models in the real world to handle the unseen scenarios.In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Neural Activation Prior (NAP) for out-of-distribution detection (OOD).Our neural activation prior is based on a key observation that, for a channel before the global pooling layer of a fully trained neural network, the probability of a few of its neurons being activated with a larger response by an in-distribution (ID) sample is significantly higher than that by an OOD sample.An intuitive explanation is each channel in a model fully trained on ID dataset would play a role in detecting a certain pattern in the samples within the ID dataset, and a few neurons can be activated with a large response when the pattern is detected in an input sample.Thus, a new scoring function based on this prior is proposed to highlight the role of these strongly activated neurons in OOD detection.This approach is plug-and-play and does not lead to any performance degradation on in-distribution data classification and requires no extra training or statistics from training or external datasets.Notice that previous methods primarily rely on post-global-pooling features of the neural networks, while the within-channel distribution information we leverage would be discarded by the global pooling operator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, our method is orthogonal to existing approaches and can be effectively combined with them in various applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, which demonstrates the power of the proposed prior.</p>

                  <p>In multimedia understanding tasks, corrupted samples pose a critical challenge, because when fed to machine learning models they lead to performance degradation.In the past, three groups of approaches have been proposed to handle noisy data: i) enhancer and denoiser modules to improve the quality of the noisy data, ii) data augmentation approaches, and iii) domain adaptation strategies.All the aforementioned approaches come with drawbacks that limit their applicability; the first has high computational costs and requires pairs of clean-corrupted data for training, while the others only allow deployment of the same task/network they were trained on (\ie, when upstream and downstream task/network are the same).In this paper, we propose SyMPIE to solve these shortcomings.To this end, we design a small, modular, and efficient (just 2GFLOPs to process a Full HD image) system to enhance input data for robust downstream multimedia understanding with minimal computational cost.Our SyMPIE is pre-trained on an upstream task/network that should not match the downstream ones and does not need paired clean-corrupted samples.Our key insight is that most input corruptions found in real-world tasks can be modeled through global operations on color channels of images or spatial filters with small kernels.We validate our approach on multiple datasets and tasks, such as image classification (on ImageNetC, ImageNetC-Bar, VizWiz, and a newly proposed mixed corruption benchmark named ImageNetC-mixed) and semantic segmentation (on Cityscapes, ACDC, and DarkZurich) with consistent improvements of about 5\% relative accuracy gain across the board.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code of our approach and the new ImageNetC-mixed benchmark will be made available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images sharing the same category across diverse domains without relying on labeled data.Prior approaches have typically decomposed the UCIR problem into two distinct tasks: intra-domain representation learning and cross-domain feature alignment.However, these segregated strategies overlook the potential synergies between these tasks.This paper introduces ProtoOT, a novel Optimal Transport formulation explicitly tailored for UCIR, which integrates intra-domain feature representation learning and cross-domain alignment into a unified framework.ProtoOT leverages the strengths of the K-means clustering method to effectively manage distribution imbalances inherent in UCIR.By utilizing K-means for generating initial prototypes and approximating class marginal distributions, we modify the constraints in Optimal Transport accordingly, significantly enhancing its performance in UCIR scenarios.Furthermore, we incorporate contrastive learning into the ProtoOT framework to further improve representation learning.This encourages local semantic consistency among features with similar semantics, while also explicitly enforcing separation between features and unmatched prototypes, thereby enhancing global discriminativeness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ProtoOT surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin across benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Notably, on DomainNet, ProtoOT achieves an average P@200 enhancement of 24.44%, and on Office-Home, it demonstrates a P@15 improvement of 12.12%.Code is available at https://github.com/HCVLAB/ProtoOT.</p>

                  <p>There are still many challenges in Federated Learning (FL).First, during the model update process, the model parameters on the local user need to be sent to the server for aggregation.This involves the consumption of network bandwidth, especially when the number of users participating in FL is large.High communication costs may limit the application of FL in certain scenarios.Secondly, since users participating in FL usually have different data distributions, this heterogeneity of data may lead to poor model performance or even failure to converge.Third, privacy and security issues are also challenges that need to be addressed in FL.There is still a risk of information leakage during model aggregation.Malicious users may obtain sensitive information by analyzing communications during model updates or aggregation processes.To address these challenges, we propose HyperFedNet (HFN), an innovative approach that leverages hypernetwork.HFN introduces a paradigm shift in transmission aggregation within FL.Unlike traditional FL methods that transmit a large number of parameters from the main network, HFN reduces the communication burden and improves security by transmitting a compact set of hypernetwork parameters.After the parameters of the hypernetwork are deployed locally to the user, the local database features quantified by the embedding vector can be used as input, and parameters can be dynamically generated for the FL main network through user forward propagation.HFN efficiently reduces communication costs while improving accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimentation demonstrates that HFN outperforms traditional FL methods significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By seamlessly integrating this concept into the conventional FL algorithm, we achieve even more impressive results compared to the original approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Non-flat surfaces pose difficulties for robots operating in unstructured environments.Reconstructions of uneven surfaces may only be partially possible due to non-compliant end-effectors and limitations on vision systems such as transparency, reflections, and occlusions.This study achieves blind surface reconstruction by harnessing the robotic manipulator's kinematic data and a compliant tactile sensing module, which incorporates inertial, magnetic, and pressure sensors.The module's flexibility enables us to estimate contact positions and surface normals by analyzing its deformation during interactions with unknown objects.While previous works collect only positional information, we include the local normals in a geometrical approach to estimate curvatures between adjacent contact points.These parameters then guide a spline-based patch generation, which allows us to recreate larger surfaces without an increase in complexity while reducing the time-consuming step of probing the surface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental validation demonstrates that this approach outperforms an off-the-shelf vision system in estimation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Moreover, this compliant haptic method works effectively even when the manipulator's approach angle is not aligned with the surface normals, which is ideal for unknown non-flat surfaces.</p>

                  <p>Multimedia online platforms (e.g., Amazon, TikTok) have greatly benefited from the incorporation of multimedia (e.g., visual, textual, and acoustic) content into their personal recommender systems.These modalities provide intuitive semantics that facilitate modality-aware user preference modeling.However, two key challenges in multi-modal recommenders remain unresolved: i)The introduction of multi-modal encoders with a large number of additional parameters causes overfitting, given high-dimensional multi-modal features provided by extractors (e.g., ViT, BERT).ii) Side information inevitably introduces inaccuracies and redundancies, which skew the modality-interaction dependency from reflecting true user preference.To tackle these problems, we propose to simplify and empower recommenders through Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation (PromptMM) with the prompt-tuning that enables adaptive quality distillation.Specifically, PromptMM conducts model compression through distilling u-i edge relationship and multi-modal node content from cumbersome teachers to relieve students from the additional feature reduction parameters.To bridge the semantic gap between multi-modal context and collaborative signals for empowering the overfitting teacher, soft prompt-tuning is introduced to perform student task-adaptive.Additionally, to adjust the impact of inaccuracies in multimedia data, a disentangled multi-modal list-wise distillation is developed with modality-aware re-weighting mechanism.Experiments on real-world data demonstrate PromptMM's superiority over existing techniques.Ablation tests confirm the effectiveness of key components.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additional tests show the efficiency and effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sequential data naturally arises from user engagement on digital platforms like social media, music streaming services, and web navigation, encapsulating evolving user preferences and behaviors through continuous information streams.A notable unresolved query in stochastic processes is learning mixtures of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs).While there is progress in learning mixtures of discrete-time Markov chains with recovery guarantees [GKV16,ST23,KTT2023], the continuous scenario uncovers unique unexplored challenges.The intrigue in CTMC mixtures stems from their potential to model intricate continuous-time stochastic processes prevalent in various fields including social media, finance, and biology.   In this study, we introduce a novel framework for exploring CTMCs, emphasizing the influence of observed trails' length and mixture parameters on problem regimes, which demands specific algorithms.Through thorough experimentation, we examine the impact of discretizing continuous-time trails on the learnability of the continuous-time mixture, given that these processes are often observed via discrete, resource-demanding observations.Our comparative analysis with leading methods explores sample complexity and the trade-off between the number of trails and their lengths, offering crucial insights for method selection in different problem instances.We apply our algorithms on an extensive collection of Lastfm's user-generated trails spanning three years, demonstrating the capability of our algorithms to differentiate diverse user preferences.We pioneer the use of CTMC mixtures on a basketball passing dataset to unveil intricate offensive tactics of NBA teams.This underscores the pragmatic utility and versatility of our proposed framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All results presented in this study are replicable, and we provide the implementations to facilitate reproducibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>A common problem encountered in many real-world applications is level set estimation where the goal is to determine the region in the function domain where the function is above or below a given threshold.When the function is black-box and expensive to evaluate, the level sets need to be found in a minimum set of function evaluations.Existing methods often assume a discrete search space with a finite set of data points for function evaluations and estimating the level sets.When applied to a continuous search space, these methods often need to first discretize the space which leads to poor results while needing high computational time.While some methods cater for the continuous setting, they still lack a proper guarantee for theoretical convergence.To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that does not need any discretization and can directly work in continuous search spaces.Our method suggests points by constructing an acquisition function that is defined as a measure of confidence of the function being higher or lower than the given threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A theoretical analysis for the convergence of the algorithm to an accurate solution is provided. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>On multiple synthetic and real-world datasets, our algorithm successfully outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning encounters substantial challenges with heterogeneous data, leading to performance degradation and convergence issues.While considerable progress has been achieved in mitigating such an impact, the reliability aspect of federated models has been largely disregarded.In this study, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the reliability of both generic and personalized federated models.Our exploration uncovers a significant finding: \textbf{federated models exhibit unreliability when faced with heterogeneous data}, demonstrating poor calibration on in-distribution test data and low uncertainty levels on out-of-distribution data.This unreliability is primarily attributed to the presence of biased projection heads, which introduce miscalibration into the federated models.Inspired by this observation, we propose the "Assembled Projection Heads" (APH) method for enhancing the reliability of federated models.By treating the existing projection head parameters as priors, APH randomly samples multiple initialized parameters of projection heads from the prior and further performs targeted fine-tuning on locally available data under varying learning rates.Such a head ensemble introduces parameter diversity into the deterministic model, eliminating the bias and producing reliable predictions via head averaging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed APH method across three prominent federated benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>Experimental results validate the efficacy of APH in model calibration and uncertainty estimation.Notably, APH can be seamlessly integrated into various federated approaches but only requires less than 30\% additional computation cost for 100$\times$ inferences within large models.</p>

                  <p>Modern industrial networks transport both best-effort and real-time traffic.Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) was introduced by the IEEE TSN Task Group as an enhancement to Ethernet to provide high quality of service (QoS) for real-time traffic.In a TSN network, applications signal their QoS requirements to the network before transmitting data.The network then allocates resources to meet these requirements.However, TSN-unaware applications can neither perform this registration process nor profit from TSN's QoS benefits.The contributions of this paper are twofold.First, we introduce a novel network architecture in which an additional device autonomously signals the QoS requirements of TSN-unaware applications to the network.Second, we propose a processing method to detect real-time streams in a network and extract the necessary information for the TSN stream signaling.It leverages a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) to detect periodic traffic, extracts an accurate traffic description, and uses traffic classification to determine the source application.As a result, our proposal allows TSN-unaware applications to benefit from TSNs QoS guarantees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluations underline the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and processing method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI image models may inadvertently generate problematic representations of people.Past research has noted that millions of users engage daily across the world with these models and that the models, including through problematic representations of people, have the potential to compound and accelerate real-world discrimination and other harms (Bianchi et al, 2023).In this paper, we focus on addressing the generation of problematic associations between demographic groups and semantic concepts that may reflect and reinforce negative narratives embedded in social data.Building on sociological literature (Blumer, 1958) and mapping representations to model behaviors, we have developed a taxonomy to study problematic associations in image generation models.We explore the effectiveness of fine tuning at the model level as a method to address these associations, identifying a potential reduction in visual quality as a limitation of traditional fine tuning.We also propose a new methodology with twice-human-in-the-loop (T-HITL) that promises improvements in both reducing problematic associations and also maintaining visual quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of T-HITL by providing evidence of three problematic associations addressed by T-HITL at the model level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span>Our contributions to scholarship are two-fold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By defining problematic associations in the context of machine learning models and generative AI, we introduce a conceptual and technical taxonomy for addressing some of these associations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Finally, we provide a method, T-HITL, that addresses these associations and simultaneously maintains visual quality of image model generations.This mitigation need not be a tradeoff, but rather an enhancement.</p>

                  <p>Designing molecules with desirable properties, such as drug-likeliness and high binding affinities towards protein targets, is a challenging problem.In this paper, we propose the Dual-Space Optimization (DSO) method that integrates latent space sampling and data space selection to solve this problem.DSO iteratively updates a latent space generative model and a synthetic dataset in an optimization process that gradually shifts the generative model and the synthetic data towards regions of desired property values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our generative model takes the form of a Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT) where the latent vector serves as the prompt of a causal transformer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>Our extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method, which sets new performance benchmarks across single-objective, multi-objective and constrained molecule design tasks.</p>

                  <p>Implicit generative models have the capability to learn arbitrary complex data distributions.On the downside, training requires telling apart real data from artificially-generated ones using adversarial discriminators, leading to unstable training and mode-dropping issues.As reported by Zahee et al. (2017), even in the one-dimensional (1D) case, training a generative adversarial network (GAN) is challenging and often suboptimal.In this work, we develop a discriminator-free method for training one-dimensional (1D) generative implicit models and subsequently expand this method to accommodate multivariate cases.Our loss function is a discrepancy measure between a suitably chosen transformation of the model samples and a uniform distribution; hence, it is invariant with respect to the true distribution of the data.We first formulate our method for 1D random variables, providing an effective solution for approximate reparameterization of arbitrary complex distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we consider the temporal setting (both univariate and multivariate), in which we model the conditional distribution of each sample given the history of the process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span>We demonstrate through numerical simulations that this new method yields promising results, successfully learning true distributions in a variety of scenarios and mitigating some of the well-known problems that state-of-the-art implicit methods present.</p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous graph learning aims to capture complex relationships and diverse relational semantics among entities in a heterogeneous graph to obtain meaningful representations for nodes and edges.Recent advancements in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance by considering relation heterogeneity and using specialized message functions and aggregation rules.However, existing frameworks for heterogeneous graph learning have limitations in generalizing across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets.Most of these frameworks follow the "pre-train" and "fine-tune" paradigm on the same dataset, which restricts their capacity to adapt to new and unseen data.This raises the question: "Can we generalize heterogeneous graph models to be well-adapted to diverse downstream learning tasks with distribution shifts in both node token sets and relation type heterogeneity?''To tackle those challenges, we propose HiGPT, a general large graph model with Heterogeneous graph instruction-tuning paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework enables learning from arbitrary heterogeneous graphs without the need for any fine-tuning process from downstream datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>To handle distribution shifts in heterogeneity, we introduce an in-context heterogeneous graph tokenizer that captures semantic relationships in different heterogeneous graphs, facilitating model adaptation.We incorporate a large corpus of heterogeneity-aware graph instructions into our HiGPT, enabling the model to effectively comprehend complex relation heterogeneity and distinguish between various types of graph tokens.Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) instruction augmentation paradigm to mitigate data scarcity by generating diverse and informative instructions.Through comprehensive evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of generalization performance.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is a critical challenge across various research domains, aiming to identify instances that deviate from normal data distributions.This paper explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in fraud detection, comparing their advantages with traditional methods.GANs, a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have shown promise in modeling complex data distributions, making them effective tools for anomaly detection.The paper systematically describes the principles of GANs and their derivative models, emphasizing their application in fraud detection across different datasets.And by building a collection of adversarial verification graphs, we will effectively prevent fraud caused by bots or automated systems and ensure that the users in the transaction are real.The objective of the experiment is to design and implement a fake face verification code and fraud detection system based on Generative Adversarial network (GANs) algorithm to enhance the security of the transaction process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The study demonstrates the potential of GANs in enhancing transaction security through deep learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traveling waves are a fundamental phenomenon in the brain, playing a crucial role in short-term information storage.In this study, we leverage the concept of traveling wave dynamics within a neural lattice to formulate a theoretical model of neural working memory, study its properties, and its real world implications in AI.The proposed model diverges from traditional approaches, which assume information storage in static, register-like locations updated by interference.Instead, the model stores data as waves that is updated by the wave's boundary conditions.We rigorously examine the model's capabilities in representing and learning state histories, which are vital for learning history-dependent dynamical systems.The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem.To understand the model's real-world applicability, we explore two cases: linear boundary condition and non-linear, self-attention-driven boundary condition.The experiments reveal that the linear scenario is effectively learned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) through backpropagation when modeling history-dependent dynamical systems.Conversely, the non-linear scenario parallels the autoregressive loop of an attention-only transformer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Collectively, our findings suggest the broader relevance of traveling waves in AI and its potential in advancing neural network architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper proposes an innovative Attention-GAN framework for enhancing cybersecurity, focusing on anomaly detection.In response to the challenges posed by the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, the proposed approach aims to generate diverse and realistic synthetic attack scenarios, thereby enriching the dataset and improving threat identification.Integrating attention mechanisms with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a key feature of the proposed method.The attention mechanism enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features, essential for detecting subtle and complex attack patterns.In addition, GANs address the issue of data scarcity by generating additional varied attack data, encompassing known and emerging threats.This dual approach ensures that the system remains relevant and effective against the continuously evolving cyberattacks.The KDD Cup and CICIDS2017 datasets were used to validate this model, which exhibited significant improvements in anomaly detection.It achieved an accuracy of 99.69% on the KDD dataset and 97.93% on the CICIDS2017 dataset, with precision, recall, and F1-scores above 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing complex attack patterns.This study contributes significantly to cybersecurity by providing a scalable and adaptable solution for anomaly detection in the face of sophisticated and dynamic cyber threats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The exploration of GANs for data augmentation highlights a promising direction for future research, particularly in situations where data limitations restrict the development of cybersecurity systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>The attention-GAN framework has emerged as a pioneering approach, setting a new benchmark for advanced cyber-defense strategies.</p>

                  <p>In the field of Medical Imaging, extensive research has been dedicated to leveraging its potential in uncovering critical diagnostic features in patients.Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven medical diagnosis relies on sophisticated machine learning and deep learning models to analyze, detect, and identify diseases from medical images.Despite the remarkable performance of these models, characterized by high accuracy, they grapple with trustworthiness issues.The introduction of a subtle perturbation to the original image empowers adversaries to manipulate the prediction output, redirecting it to other targeted or untargeted classes.Furthermore, the scarcity of publicly available medical images, constituting a bottleneck for reliable training, has led contemporary algorithms to depend on pretrained models grounded on a large set of natural images -- a practice referred to as transfer learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, a significant {\em domain discrepancy} exists between natural and medical images, which causes AI models resulting from transfer learning to exhibit heightened {\em vulnerability} to adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>This paper proposes a {\em domain assimilation} approach that introduces texture and color adaptation into transfer learning, followed by a texture preservation component to suppress undesired distortion.We systematically analyze the performance of transfer learning in the face of various adversarial attacks under different data modalities, with the overarching goal of fortifying the model's robustness and security in medical imaging tasks.The results demonstrate high effectiveness in reducing attack efficacy, contributing toward more trustworthy transfer learning in biomedical applications.</p>
