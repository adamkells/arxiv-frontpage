                  <p>As large language models rapidly evolve to support longer context, there is a notable disparity in their capability to generate output at greater lengths.Recent study suggests that the primary cause for this imbalance may arise from the lack of data with long-output during alignment training.In light of this observation, attempts are made to re-align foundation models with data that fills the gap, which result in models capable of generating lengthy output when instructed.In this paper, we explore the impact of data-quality in tuning a model for long output, and the possibility of doing so from the starting points of human-aligned (instruct or chat) models.With careful data curation, we show that it possible to achieve similar performance improvement in our tuned models, with only a small fraction of training data instances and compute.In addition, we assess the generalizability of such approaches by applying our tuning-recipes to several models.our findings suggest that, while capacities for generating long output vary across different models out-of-the-box, our approach to tune them with high-quality data using lite compute, consistently yields notable improvement across all models we experimented on.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have made public our curated dataset for tuning long-writing capability, the implementations of model tuning and evaluation, as well as the fine-tuned models, all of which can be openly-accessed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span></p>

                  <p>Meta-learning has emerged as a prominent technology for few-shot text classification and has achieved promising performance.However, existing methods often encounter difficulties in drawing accurate class prototypes from support set samples, primarily due to probable large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences within the task.Recent approaches attempt to incorporate external knowledge or pre-trained language models to augment data, but this requires additional resources and thus does not suit many few-shot scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel solution to address this issue by adequately leveraging the information within the task itself.Specifically, we utilize label information to construct a task-adaptive metric space, thereby adaptively reducing the intra-class differences and magnifying the inter-class differences.We further employ the optimal transport technique to estimate class prototypes with query set samples together, mitigating the problem of inaccurate and ambiguous support set samples caused by large intra-class differences.We conduct extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets, and our approach shows obvious advantages over state-of-the-art models across all the tasks on all the datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For reproducibility, all the datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/YvoGao/LAQDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.935</span></span></p>

                  <p>Adapting medical Large Language Models to local languages can reduce barriers to accessing healthcare services, but data scarcity remains a significant challenge, particularly for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity.Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing.Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence.This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others.Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability.Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p>

                  <p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in mono-channel audio generation.However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapes often have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions.Controlling stereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costs and unstable generative models.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address these issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first construct a large-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundant soundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Beyond text modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally paired stereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation.Existing audio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatial audio.To provide accurate guidance for latent diffusion models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance.By leveraging spatial guidance, our unified model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text and image but also enables interactive audio generation during inference.Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods.The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules.</p>

                  <p>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive advancements, yet information about their training data, a critical factor in their performance, remains undisclosed.Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific instance was part of a target model's training data.MIAs can offer insights into LLM outputs and help detect and address concerns such as data contamination and compliance with privacy and copyright standards.However, applying MIAs to LLMs presents unique challenges due to the massive scale of pre-training data and the ambiguous nature of membership.Additionally, creating appropriate benchmarks to evaluate MIA methods is not straightforward, as training and test data distributions are often unknown.In this paper, we introduce EM-MIA, a novel MIA method for LLMs that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm, leveraging the duality that the estimates of these scores can be improved by each other.Membership scores and prefix scores assess how each instance is likely to be a member and discriminative as a prefix, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the WikiMIA dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>To further evaluate EM-MIA, we present OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows us to control the difficulty of MIA tasks with varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions.We believe that EM-MIA serves as a robust MIA method for LLMs and that OLMoMIA provides a valuable resource for comprehensively evaluating MIA approaches, thereby driving future research in this critical area.</p>

We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</p>

                  <p>Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for learning.However, infrequently occurring concepts may have few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms, even in large KGs.For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples relative to the number of known diseases.Large Language Model (LLM) generation of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information extraction tasks.   Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13B<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Chat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>We measured overall and Out of Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data augmentation.We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4 different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.   Results:Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all 3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by 3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data.A small improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only one dataset showed OOD improvement.   Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data with synthetic mentions.Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance.The same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our software and dataset publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions.However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses.Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses.The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data.To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions.We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models.Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks.When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval.Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.</p>

                  <p>Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (RAIT) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to refuse to answer unknown questions.By modifying responses of unknown questions in the training data to refusal responses such as "I don't know", RAIT enhances the reliability of LLMs and reduces their hallucination.Generally, RAIT modifies training samples based on the correctness of the initial LLM's response.However, this crude approach can cause LLMs to excessively refuse answering questions they could have correctly answered, the problem we call over-refusal.In this paper, we explore two primary causes of over-refusal: Static conflict emerges when the RAIT data is constructed solely on correctness criteria, causing similar samples in the LLM's feature space to be assigned different labels (original vs. modified "I don't know").Dynamic conflict occurs due to the changes of LLM's knowledge state during fine-tuning, which transforms previous unknown questions into knowns, while the training data, which is constructed based on the initial LLM, remains unchanged.These conflicts cause the trained LLM to misclassify known questions as unknown, resulting in over-refusal.To address this issue, we introduce Certainty Represented Knowledge Flow for Refusal-Aware Instructions Construction (CRaFT).CRaFT centers on two main contributions: First, we additionally incorporate response certainty to selectively filter and modify data, reducing static conflicts.Second, we implement preliminary rehearsal training to characterize changes in the LLM's knowledge state, which helps mitigate dynamic conflicts during the fine-tuning process.We conducted extensive experiments on open-ended question answering and multiple-choice question task.Experiment results show that CRaFT can improve LLM's overall performance during the RAIT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code and training data will be released at Github. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern machine learning models deployed often encounter distribution shifts in real-world applications, manifesting as covariate or semantic out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts.These shifts give rise to challenges in OOD generalization and OOD detection.This paper introduces a novel, integrated approach AHA (Adaptive Human-Assisted OOD learning) to simultaneously address both OOD generalization and detection through a human-assisted framework by labeling data in the wild.Our approach strategically labels examples within a novel maximum disambiguation region, where the number of semantic and covariate OOD data roughly equalizes.By labeling within this region, we can maximally disambiguate the two types of OOD data, thereby maximizing the utility of the fixed labeling budget.Our algorithm first utilizes a noisy binary search algorithm that identifies the maximal disambiguation region with high probability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The algorithm then continues with annotating inside the identified labeling region, reaping the full benefit of human feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our framework.We observed that with only a few hundred human annotations, our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that do not involve human assistance, in both OOD generalization and OOD detection.Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/HaoyueBaiZJU/aha}.</p>

                  <p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios.The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels.This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle.To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance.Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%).Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation.With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts.Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes.The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p>

                  <p>Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to recognize new classes with limited labeled data.Recent studies have attempted to address the challenge of rare samples with textual prompts to modulate visual features.However, they usually struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between textual and visual features.Moreover, vanilla self-attention is heavily affected by useless information in images, severely constraining the potential of semantic priors in FSL due to the confusion of numerous irrelevant tokens during interaction.To address these aforementioned issues, a K-NN Transformer with Pyramid Prompts (KTPP) is proposed to select discriminative information with K-NN Context Attention (KCA) and adaptively modulate visual features with Pyramid Cross-modal Prompts (PCP).First, for each token, the KCA only selects the K most relevant tokens to compute the self-attention matrix and incorporates the mean of all tokens as the context prompt to provide the global context in three cascaded stages.As a result, irrelevant tokens can be progressively suppressed.Secondly, pyramid prompts are introduced in the PCP to emphasize visual features via interactions between text-based class-aware prompts and multi-scale visual features.This allows the ViT to dynamically adjust the importance weights of visual features based on rich semantic information at different scales, making models robust to spatial variations.Finally, augmented visual features and class-aware prompts are interacted via the KCA to extract class-specific features.Consequently, our model further enhances noise-free visual representations via deep cross-modal interactions, extracting generalized visual representation in scenarios with few labeled samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span></p>

                  <p>The utilization of sketching techniques has progressively emerged as a pivotal method for enhancing the efficiency of online learning.In linear bandit settings, current sketch-based approaches leverage matrix sketching to reduce the per-round time complexity from \(\Omega\left(d^2\right)\) to \(O(d)\), where \(d\) is the input dimension.Despite this improved efficiency, these approaches encounter critical pitfalls: if the spectral tail of the covariance matrix does not decrease rapidly, it can lead to linear regret.In this paper, we revisit the regret analysis and algorithm design concerning approximating the covariance matrix using matrix sketching in linear bandits.We illustrate how inappropriate sketch sizes can result in unbounded spectral loss, thereby causing linear regret.To prevent this issue, we propose Dyadic Block Sketching, an innovative streaming matrix sketching approach that adaptively manages sketch size to constrain global spectral loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach effectively tracks the best rank-\( k \) approximation in an online manner, ensuring efficiency when the geometry of the covariance matrix is favorable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Then, we apply the proposed Dyadic Block Sketching to linear bandits and demonstrate that the resulting bandit algorithm can achieve sublinear regret without prior knowledge of the covariance matrix, even under the worst case.Our method is a general framework for efficient sketch-based linear bandits, applicable to all existing sketch-based approaches, and offers improved regret bounds accordingly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies using both synthetic and real-world data to validate the accuracy of our theoretical findings and to highlight the effectiveness of our algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Conventional prediction methods such as logistic regression and gradient boosting have been widely utilized for disease onset prediction for their reliability and interpretability.Deep learning methods promise enhanced prediction performance by extracting complex patterns from clinical data, but face challenges like data sparsity and high dimensionality.   Methods: This study compares conventional and deep learning approaches to predict lung cancer, dementia, and bipolar disorder using observational data from eleven databases from North America, Europe, and Asia.Models were developed using logistic regression, gradient boosting, ResNet, and Transformer, and validated both internally and externally across the data sources.Discrimination performance was assessed using AUROC, and calibration was evaluated using Eavg.   Findings:Across 11 datasets, conventional methods generally outperformed deep learning methods in terms of discrimination performance, particularly during external validation, highlighting their better transportability.Learning curves suggest that deep learning models require substantially larger datasets to reach the same performance levels as conventional methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Calibration performance was also better for conventional methods, with ResNet showing the poorest calibration.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Interpretation: Despite the potential of deep learning models to capture complex patterns in structured observational healthcare data, conventional models remain highly competitive for disease onset prediction, especially in scenarios involving smaller datasets and if lengthy training times need to be avoided.The study underscores the need for future research focused on optimizing deep learning models to handle the sparsity, high dimensionality, and heterogeneity inherent in healthcare datasets, and find new strategies to exploit the full capabilities of deep learning methods.</p>

                  <p>The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning.Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information.Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space.As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space.To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE.Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model.To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Code and models are available at: https://github.com/modelscope/facechain/tree/main/face_module/TopoFR.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models have propelled the development of joint probabilistic models capable of both image understanding and generation.However, we have identifed that recent methods inevitably suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps.To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework.Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss.Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding.In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step.To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals.Through extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks, MMAR demonstrates much more superior performance than other joint multi-modal models, matching the method that employs pretrained CLIP vision encoder, meanwhile being able to generate high quality images at the same time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also showed that our method is scalable with larger data and model size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) performance is highly influenced by data distribution across clients, and non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) leads to a slower convergence of the global model and a decrease in model effectiveness.The existing algorithms for solving the non-IID problem are focused on the traditional centralized FL (CFL), where a central server is used for model aggregation.However, in decentralized FL (DFL), nodes lack the overall vision of the federation.To address the non-IID problem in DFL, this paper proposes a novel DFL aggregation algorithm, Federated Entropy Pooling (FedEP).FedEP mitigates the client drift problem by incorporating the statistical characteristics of local distributions instead of any actual data.Prior to training, each client conducts a local distribution fitting using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and shares the resulting statistical characteristics with its neighbors.After receiving the statistical characteristics shared by its neighbors, each node tries to fit the global data distribution.In the aggregation phase, each node calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences of the local data distribution over the fitted global data distribution, giving the weights to generate the aggregated model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments have demonstrated that FedEP can achieve faster convergence and show higher test performance than state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for learning.However, infrequently occurring concepts may have few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms, even in large KGs.For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples relative to the number of known diseases.Large Language Model (LLM) generation of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information extraction tasks.   Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13BChat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group.We measured overall and Out of Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data augmentation.We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4 different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.   Results:Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all 3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by 3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A small improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only one dataset showed OOD improvement.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data with synthetic mentions.Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance.The same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER.We make our software and dataset publicly available.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel graphical approach that counts the number of global 8-cycles on the SCRAM three-layer Tanner graph.SCRAM, which stands for Slotted Coded Random Access Multiplexing, is a joint decoder that is meets challenging requirements of 6G. At the transmitter side, the data of the accommodated users is encoded by Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, and the codewords are transmitted over the shared channel by means of Slotted ALOHA.Unlike the state-of-the-art sequential decoders, the SCRAM decoder jointly resolves collisions and decodes the LDPC codewords, in a similar analogy to Belief Propagation on a three-layer Tanner graph.By leveraging the analogy between the two-layer Tanner graph of conventional LDPC codes and the three-layer Tanner graph of SCRAM, the well-developed analysis tools of classical LDPC codes could be utilized to enhance the performance of SCRAM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In essence, the contribution of this paper is three-fold; First it proposes the methodology to utilize these tools to assess the performance of SCRAM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Second, it derives a lower bound on the shortest cycle length of an arbitrary SCRAM Tanner graph.Finally, the paper presents a novel graphical method that counts the number of cycles of length that corresponds to the girth.</p>

                  <p>Physics-informed deep learning often faces optimization challenges due to the complexity of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve exploring large solution spaces, require numerous iterations, and can lead to unstable training.These challenges arise particularly from the ill-conditioning of the optimization problem, caused by the differential terms in the loss function.To address these issues, we propose learning a solver, i.e., solving PDEs using a physics-informed iterative algorithm trained on data.Our method learns to condition a gradient descent algorithm that automatically adapts to each PDE instance, significantly accelerating and stabilizing the optimization process and enabling faster convergence of physics-aware models.Furthermore, while traditional physics-informed methods solve for a single PDE instance, our approach addresses parametric PDEs.Specifically, our method integrates the physical loss gradient with the PDE parameters to solve over a distribution of PDE parameters, including coefficients, initial conditions, or boundary conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through empirical experiments on multiple datasets, comparing training and test-time optimization performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios.The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels.This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle.To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans.We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data.Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes.Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance.Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%).Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation.With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p>

In this work, we introduce Node Tokenizer for Large Language Models (NT-LLM), a novel framework that efficiently encodes graph structures by selecting key nodes as anchors and representing each node based on its relative distance to these anchors.This position-anchored encoding effectively captures the graph topology, enabling enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs over graph data.Additionally, we implement a task-specific tuning procedure to further improve structural understanding within LLMs.Through extensive empirical evaluations, NT-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements across a variety of graph-related tasks.</p>

                  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly intervening in our lives, raising widespread concern about its unintended and undeclared side effects.These developments have brought attention to the problem of AI auditing: the systematic evaluation and analysis of an AI system, its development, and its behavior relative to a set of predetermined criteria.Auditing can take many forms, including pre-deployment risk assessments, ongoing monitoring, and compliance testing.It plays a critical role in providing assurances to various AI stakeholders, from developers to end users.Audits may, for instance, be used to verify that an algorithm complies with the law, is consistent with industry standards, and meets the developer's claimed specifications.However, there are many operational challenges to AI auditing that complicate its implementation.   In this work, we examine a key operational issue in AI auditing: what type of access to an AI system is needed to perform a meaningful audit?Addressing this question has direct policy relevance, as it can inform AI audit guidelines and requirements.We begin by discussing the factors that auditors balance when determining the appropriate type of access, and unpack the benefits and drawbacks of four types of access.We conclude that, at minimum, black-box access -- providing query access to a model without exposing its internal implementation -- should be granted to auditors, as it balances concerns related to trade secrets, data privacy, audit standardization, and audit efficiency.We then suggest a framework for determining how much further access (in addition to black-box access) to grant auditors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that auditing can be cast as a natural hypothesis test, draw parallels hypothesis testing and legal procedure, and argue that this framing provides clear and interpretable guidance on audit implementation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span></p>

                  <p>In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the underlying system dynamics from observed time series.While powerful methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage it for generalization is still an open question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This becomes particularly important when individual time series are short, and group-level information may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>At the same time, averaging is not an option in DSR, as it will wipe out crucial dynamical properties (e.g., limit cycles in one domain vs. chaos in another).Hence, a framework is needed that enables to efficiently harvest group-level (multi-domain) information while retaining all single-domain dynamical characteristics.Here we provide such a hierarchical approach and showcase it on popular DSR benchmarks, as well as on neuroscientific and medical time series.In addition to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in which datasets with similar dynamics cluster.The features spanning these spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the underlying system.Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization to new parameter regimes.</p>

To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models.   We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of \method compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion.We further validate the efficacy of \method through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning.   On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from significant degradation.Our codebase is available at https://github.com/Blackzxy/HyperINF.</p>

                  <p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations.This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data.To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT).TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts.By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps.Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce SIREN, a novel methodology to proactively trace unauthorized data usage in black-box personalized text-to-image diffusion models.Our approach optimizes the coating in a delicate way to be recognized by the model as a feature relevant to the personalization task, thus significantly improving its learnability.We also utilize a human perceptual-aware constraint, a hypersphere classification technique, and a hypothesis-testing-guided verification method to enhance the stealthiness and detection accuracy of the coating.The effectiveness of SIREN is verified through extensive experiments on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, models, and learning algorithms.SIREN is also effective in various real-world scenarios and evaluated against potential countermeasures.Our code is publicly available.</p>

In this work, we examine a key operational issue in AI auditing: what type of access to an AI system is needed to perform a meaningful audit?Addressing this question has direct policy relevance, as it can inform AI audit guidelines and requirements.We begin by discussing the factors that auditors balance when determining the appropriate type of access, and unpack the benefits and drawbacks of four types of access.We conclude that, at minimum, black-box access -- providing query access to a model without exposing its internal implementation -- should be granted to auditors, as it balances concerns related to trade secrets, data privacy, audit standardization, and audit efficiency.We then suggest a framework for determining how much further access (in addition to black-box access) to grant auditors.We show that auditing can be cast as a natural hypothesis test, draw parallels hypothesis testing and legal procedure, and argue that this framing provides clear and interpretable guidance on audit implementation.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concept activation vector (CAV) has attracted broad research interest in explainable AI, by elegantly attributing model predictions to specific concepts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>However, the training of CAV often necessitates a large number of high-quality images, which are expensive to curate and thus limited to a predefined set of concepts.To address this issue, we propose Language-Guided CAV (LG-CAV) to harness the abundant concept knowledge within the certain pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP).This method allows training any CAV without labeled data, by utilizing the corresponding concept descriptions as guidance.To bridge the gap between vision-language model and the target model, we calculate the activation values of concept descriptions on a common pool of images (probe images) with vision-language model and utilize them as language guidance to train the LG-CAV.Furthermore, after training high-quality LG-CAVs related to all the predicted classes in the target model, we propose the activation sample reweighting (ASR), serving as a model correction technique, to improve the performance of the target model in return.Experiments on four datasets across nine architectures demonstrate that LG-CAV achieves significantly superior quality to previous CAV methods given any concept, and our model correction method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing concept-based methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/hqhQAQ/LG-CAV.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion models are pushing the boundaries of what generative AI can achieve in our lives.Beyond their ability to generate general images, new personalization techniques have been proposed to customize the pre-trained base models for crafting images with specific themes or styles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such a lightweight solution, enabling AI practitioners and developers to easily build their own personalized models, also poses a new concern regarding whether the personalized models are trained from unauthorized data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>A promising solution is to proactively enable data traceability in generative models, where data owners embed external coatings (e.g., image watermarks or backdoor triggers) onto the datasets before releasing.Later the models trained over such datasets will also learn the coatings and unconsciously reproduce them in the generated mimicries, which can be extracted and used as the data usage evidence.However, we identify the existing coatings cannot be effectively learned in personalization tasks, making the corresponding verification less reliable.   In this paper, we introduce SIREN, a novel methodology to proactively trace unauthorized data usage in black-box personalized text-to-image diffusion models.Our approach optimizes the coating in a delicate way to be recognized by the model as a feature relevant to the personalization task, thus significantly improving its learnability.We also utilize a human perceptual-aware constraint, a hypersphere classification technique, and a hypothesis-testing-guided verification method to enhance the stealthiness and detection accuracy of the coating.The effectiveness of SIREN is verified through extensive experiments on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, models, and learning algorithms.SIREN is also effective in various real-world scenarios and evaluated against potential countermeasures.Our code is publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Image Coding for Machines (ICM) is becoming more important as research in computer vision progresses.ICM is a vital research field that pursues the use of images for image recognition models, facilitating efficient image transmission and storage.The demand for recognition models is growing rapidly among the general public, and their performance continues to improve.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To meet these needs, exchanging image data between consumer devices and cloud AI using ICM technology could be one possible solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>In ICM, various image compression methods have adopted Learned Image Compression (LIC).LIC includes an entropy model for estimating the bitrate of latent features, and the design of this model significantly affects its performance.Typically, LIC methods assume that the distribution of latent features follows a normal distribution.This assumption is effective for compressing images intended for human vision.However, employing an entropy model based on normal distribution is inefficient in ICM due to the limitation of image parts that require precise decoding.To address this, we propose Delta-ICM, which uses a probability distribution based on a delta function.Assuming the delta distribution as a distribution of latent features reduces the entropy of image portions unnecessary for machines.We compress the remaining portions using an entropy model based on normal distribution, similar to existing methods.Delta-ICM selects between the entropy model based on the delta distribution and the one based on the normal distribution for each latent feature.Our method outperforms existing ICM methods in image compression performance aimed at machines.</p>

Moreover, systems leveraging human activity recognition frameworks for decision-making necessitate more than just the identification of actions.They require a confidence value indicative of the certainty regarding the correspondence between observations and training examples.This is crucial to prevent overly confident responses to unforeseen scenarios that were not part of the training data and may have resulted in mismatches due to weak similarity measures within the system.To address this, we propose the incorporation of a Spectral Normalized Residual connection aimed at enhancing efficient estimation of novelty in observations.This innovative approach ensures the preservation of input distance within the feature space by imposing constraints on the maximum gradients of weight updates.By limiting these gradients, we promote a more robust handling of novel situations, thereby mitigating the risks associated with overconfidence.Our methodology involves the use of a Gaussian process to quantify the distance in feature space.</p>

                  <p>Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for learning.However, infrequently occurring concepts may have few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms, even in large KGs.For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples relative to the number of known diseases.Large Language Model (LLM) generation of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information extraction tasks.   Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13BChat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group.We measured overall and Out of Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data augmentation.We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4 different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.   Results:Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all 3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by 3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data.A small improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only one dataset showed OOD improvement.   Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data with synthetic mentions.Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance.The same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our software and dataset publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>

                  <p>Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks.Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks.However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks.To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations.Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization.For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models.In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories.For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks.Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach.The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics.Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our anonymous website: https://sites.google.com/view/evaltasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent critiques of Artificial-intelligence (AI)-generated visual content highlight concerns about the erosion of artistic originality, as these systems often replicate patterns from their training datasets, leading to significant uniformity and reduced diversity.Our research adopts a novel approach by focusing on user behavior during interactions with Text-to-Image models.Instead of solely analyzing training data patterns, we examine how users' tendencies to create original prompts or rely on common templates influence content homogenization.We developed three originality metrics -- lexical, thematic, and word-sequence originality -- and applied them to user-generated prompts from two datasets, DiffusionDB and Civiverse.Additionally, we explored how characteristics such as topic choice, language originality, and the presence of NSFW content affect image popularity, using a linear regression model to predict user engagement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research enhances the discourse on AI's impact on creativity by emphasizing the critical role of user behavior in shaping the diversity of AI-generated visual content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.597</span></span></p>

Evaluations on HERM-Bench demonstrate that HERM-7B significantly outperforms existing MLLMs across various human-centric dimensions, reflecting the current inadequacy of data annotations used in MLLM training for human-centric visual understanding.This research emphasizes the importance of specialized datasets and benchmarks in advancing the MLLMs' capabilities for human-centric understanding.</p>

                  <p>Documents are largely stored and shared digitally.Yet, digital documents are still commonly signed using (copies of) handwritten signatures, which are sensitive to fraud.Though secure, cryptography-based signature solutions exist, they are hardly used due to usability issues.This paper proposes to use digital identity wallets for securely and intuitively signing digital documents with verified personal data.Using expert feedback, we implemented this vision in an interactive prototype.The prototype was assessed in a moderated usability test (N = 15) and a subsequent unmoderated remote usability test (N = 99).While participants generally expressed satisfaction with the system, they also misunderstood how to interpret the signature information displayed by the prototype.Specifically, signed documents were also trusted when the document was signed with irrelevant personal data of the signer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that such unwarranted trust forms a threat to usable digital signatures and requires attention by the usable security community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic manipulation, owing to its multi-modal nature, often faces significant training ambiguity, necessitating explicit instructions to clearly delineate the manipulation details in tasks.In this work, we highlight that vision instruction is naturally more comprehensible to recent robotic policies than the commonly adopted text instruction, as these policies are born with some vision understanding ability like human infants.Building on this premise and drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we introduce the robotic imagery paradigm, which realizes large-scale robotic data pre-training without text annotations.Additionally, we propose the robotic gaze strategy that emulates the human eye gaze mechanism, thereby guiding subsequent actions and focusing the attention of the policy on the manipulated object.Leveraging these innovations, we develop VIRT, a fully Transformer-based policy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design comprehensive tasks using both a physical robot and simulated environments to assess the efficacy of VIRT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>The results indicate that VIRT can complete very competitive tasks like ``opening the lid of a tightly sealed bottle'', and the proposed techniques boost the success rates of the baseline policy on diverse challenging tasks from nearly 0% to more than 65%.</p>
