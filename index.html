                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly essential in processing natural languages, yet their application is frequently compromised by biases and inaccuracies originating in their training data.In this study, we introduce Cross-Care, the first benchmark framework dedicated to assessing biases and real world knowledge in LLMs, specifically focusing on the representation of disease prevalence across diverse demographic groups.We systematically evaluate how demographic biases embedded in pre-training corpora like $ThePile$ influence the outputs of LLMs.We expose and quantify discrepancies by juxtaposing these biases against actual disease prevalences in various U.S. demographic groups.Our results highlight substantial misalignment between LLM representation of disease prevalence and real disease prevalence rates across demographic subgroups, indicating a pronounced risk of bias propagation and a lack of real-world grounding for medical applications of LLMs.Furthermore, we observe that various alignment methods minimally resolve inconsistencies in the models' representation of disease prevalence across different languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For further exploration and analysis, we make all data and a data visualization tool available at: www.crosscare.net. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model "naturalness" or "acceptability" of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences.Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text.To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi (en-hi) code-mixed text.Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media.Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset.Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models trained solely on code-mixing metrics are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs).Specifically, XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations in challenging data settings.Comparison with ChatGPT's zero and fewshot capabilities shows that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks.Zero-shot transfer from English-Hindi to English-Telugu acceptability judgments using our model checkpoints proves superior to random baselines, enabling application to other code-mixed language pairs and providing further avenues of research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release our human-annotated dataset, trained checkpoints, code-mix corpus, and code for data generation and model training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.943</span></span></p>

In this paper, we present an algorithmic framework OReO that makes online reorganization decisions to balance the benefits of improved query performance with the costs of reorganization.Our framework extends results from Metrical Task Systems to provide a tight bound on the worst-case performance guarantee for online reorganization, without prior knowledge of the query workload.Through evaluation on real-world datasets and query workloads, our experiments demonstrate that online reorganization with OReO can lead to an up to 32% improvement in combined query and reorganization time compared to using a single, optimized data layout for the entire workload.</p>

                  <p>Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances in image quality assessment (IQA).However, the underlying reasons for their success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks.IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its efficient approximations.On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest.Thus, we believe that saliency plays a crucial role in human perception.In this work, we conduct an empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter.Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in handling complex queries, much of the past work has depended on extensively annotated datasets by human experts.However, this reliance on fully-supervised annotations poses scalability challenges, particularly as models and data requirements grow.To mitigate this, we explore the potential of enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with minimal human supervision.In this work, we introduce self-reinforcement, which begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the model using a small collection of annotated questions.Then it iteratively improves LLMs by learning from the differences in responses from the SFT and unfinetuned models on unlabeled questions.Our approach provides an efficient approach without relying heavily on extensive human-annotated explanations.However, current reasoning benchmarks typically only include golden-reference answers or rationales.Therefore, we present \textsc{PuzzleBen}, a weakly supervised benchmark that comprises 25,147 complex questions, answers, and human-generated rationales across various domains, such as brainteasers, puzzles, riddles, parajumbles, and critical reasoning tasks.A unique aspect of our dataset is the inclusion of 10,000 unannotated questions, enabling us to explore utilizing fewer supersized data to boost LLMs' inference capabilities.Our experiments underscore the significance of \textsc{PuzzleBen}, as well as the effectiveness of our methodology as a promising direction in future endeavors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code will be published soon on \texttt{Anonymity Link}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung condition that causes airflow obstruction.The existing methods can only detect patients who already have COPD based on obvious features shown in the spirogram (In this article, the spirogram specifically involves measuring Volume-Flow curve time series).Early prediction of COPD risk is vital for monitoring COPD disease progression, slowing it down, or even preventing its onset.However, these methods fail to early predict an individual's probability of COPD in the future based on subtle features in the spirogram.To address this gap, for the first time, we propose DeepSpiro, a method based on deep learning for early prediction of future COPD risk.DeepSpiro consists of four parts.First, we construct Volume-Flow curves guided by Time-Volume instability smoothing (SpiroSmoother) to enhance the stability of the original Volume-Flow curves precisely.Second, we extract critical features from the evolution of varied-length key patches (SpiroEncoder) to capture the key temporal evolution from original high-dimensional dynamic sequences to a unified low-dimensional temporal representation.Third, we explain the model based on temporal attention and heterogeneous feature fusion (SpiroExplainer), which integrates information from heterogeneous data such as spirogram and demographic information.Fourth, we predict the risk of COPD based on the evolution of key patch concavity (SpiroPredictor), enabling accurate prediction of the risk of disease in high-risk patients who are not yet diagnosed, for up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, and beyond.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments on the UK Biobank dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>Results show that DeepSpiro achieves an AUC value of 0.8328 in the task of detecting COPD.In early prediction tasks, high-risk and low-risk groups show significant differences in the future, with a p-value of <0.001.</p>

Methods: PubMed and IEEEXplore databases were queried.Eligibility criteria included studies investigating the use of AI in enabling the autonomous navigation of catheters/guidewires in endovascular interventions.Following PRISMA, articles were assessed using QUADAS-2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PROSPERO: CRD42023392259.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span>Results:Among 462 studies, fourteen met inclusion criteria.Reinforcement learning (9/14, 64%) and learning from demonstration (7/14, 50%) were used as data-driven models for autonomous navigation.Studies predominantly utilised physical phantoms (10/14, 71%) and in silico (4/14, 29%) models.Experiments within or around the blood vessels of the heart were reported by the majority of studies (10/14, 71%), while simple non-anatomical vessel platforms were used in three studies (3/14, 21%), and the porcine liver venous system in one study.We observed that risk of bias and poor generalisability were present across studies.No procedures were performed on patients in any of the studies reviewed.Studies lacked patient selection criteria, reference standards, and reproducibility, resulting in low clinical evidence levels.   Conclusions: AI's potential in autonomous endovascular navigation is promising, but in an experimental proof-of-concept stage, with a technology readiness level of 3.We highlight that reference standards with well-identified performance metrics are crucial to allow for comparisons of data-driven algorithms proposed in the years to come.</p>

                  <p>Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model trained on a fully-labeled source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain.While the source model is a key avenue for acquiring target pseudolabels, the generated pseudolabels may exhibit source bias.In the conventional SFDA pipeline, a large data (e.g. ImageNet) pre-trained feature extractor is used to initialize the source model at the start of source training, and subsequently discarded.Despite having diverse features important for generalization, the pre-trained feature extractor can overfit to the source data distribution during source training and forget relevant target domain knowledge.Rather than discarding this valuable knowledge, we introduce an integrated framework to incorporate pre-trained networks into the target adaptation process.The proposed framework is flexible and allows us to plug modern pre-trained networks into the adaptation process to leverage their stronger representation learning capabilities.For adaptation, we propose the Co-learn algorithm to improve target pseudolabel quality collaboratively through the source model and a pre-trained feature extractor.Building on the recent success of the vision-language model CLIP in zero-shot image recognition, we present an extension Co-learn++ to further incorporate CLIP's zero-shot classification decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on 3 benchmark datasets and include more challenging scenarios such as open-set, partial-set and open-partial SFDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy improves adaptation performance and can be successfully integrated with existing SFDA methods.</p>

                  <p>Simulating soil reflectance spectra is invaluable for soil-plant radiative modeling and training machine learning models, yet it is difficult as the intricate relationships between soil structure and its constituents.To address this, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra based on soil property inputs was developed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The model is trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property pairs from 17 datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.889</span></span>It generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format.The generative model can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties.SOGM is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the full visible-near-infrared range (VIS-NIR; 400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM.The SOGM was up-scaled by coupling with the Helios 3D plant modeling software, which allowed for generation of synthetic aerial images of simulated soil and plant scenes.It can also be easily integrated with soil-plant radiation model used for remote sensin research like PROSAIL.The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets that not included in model training proved that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs.The presented models are openly accessible on: https://github.com/GEMINI-Breeding/SOGM_soil_spectra_simulation.</p>

                  <p>Temporally localizing the presence of object states in videos is crucial in understanding human activities beyond actions and objects.This task has suffered from a lack of training data due to object states' inherent ambiguity and variety.To avoid exhaustive annotation, learning from transcribed narrations in instructional videos would be intriguing.However, object states are less described in narrations compared to actions, making them less effective.In this work, we propose to extract the object state information from action information included in narrations, using large language models (LLMs).Our observation is that LLMs include world knowledge on the relationship between actions and their resulting object states, and can infer the presence of object states from past action sequences.The proposed LLM-based framework offers flexibility to generate plausible pseudo-object state labels against arbitrary categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method with our newly collected Multiple Object States Transition (MOST) dataset including dense temporal annotation of 60 object state categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Our model trained by the generated pseudo-labels demonstrates significant improvement of over 29% in mAP against strong zero-shot vision-language models, showing the effectiveness of explicitly extracting object state information from actions through LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent works in hand-object reconstruction mainly focus on the single-view and dense multi-view settings.On the one hand, single-view methods can leverage learned shape priors to generalise to unseen objects but are prone to inaccuracies due to occlusions.On the other hand, dense multi-view methods are very accurate but cannot easily adapt to unseen objects without further data collection.In contrast, sparse multi-view methods can take advantage of the additional views to tackle occlusion, while keeping the computational cost low compared to dense multi-view methods.In this paper, we consider the problem of hand-object reconstruction with unseen objects in the sparse multi-view setting.Given multiple RGB images of the hand and object captured at the same time, our model SVHO combines the predictions from each view into a unified reconstruction without optimisation across views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train our model on a synthetic hand-object dataset and evaluate directly on a real world recorded hand-object dataset with unseen objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>We show that while reconstruction of unseen hands and objects from RGB is challenging, additional views can help improve the reconstruction quality.</p>

                  <p>The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks.However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved.The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective.In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span>We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks.Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points.We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks.We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2.Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning applications on extremely low-power devices, commonly referred to as tiny machine learning (TinyML), promises a smarter and more connected world.However, the advancement of current TinyML research is hindered by the limited size and quality of pertinent datasets.To address this challenge, we introduce Wake Vision, a large-scale, diverse dataset tailored for person detection -- the canonical task for TinyML visual sensing.Wake Vision comprises over 6 million images, which is a hundredfold increase compared to the previous standard, and has undergone thorough quality filtering.Using Wake Vision for training results in a 2.41\% increase in accuracy compared to the established benchmark.Alongside the dataset, we provide a collection of five detailed benchmark sets that assess model performance on specific segments of the test data, such as varying lighting conditions, distances from the camera, and demographic characteristics of subjects.These novel fine-grained benchmarks facilitate the evaluation of model quality in challenging real-world scenarios that are often ignored when focusing solely on overall accuracy.Through an evaluation of a MobileNetV2 TinyML model on the benchmarks, we show that the input resolution plays a more crucial role than the model width in detecting distant subjects and that the impact of quantization on model robustness is minimal, thanks to the dataset quality.These findings underscore the importance of a detailed evaluation to identify essential factors for model development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, benchmark suite, code, and models are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, enabling their use for commercial use cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span></p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting.Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners.However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons.First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency.Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited.In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions.To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes.Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes.Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP.By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance.Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p>

                  <p>Prompt learning has become the most effective paradigm for adapting large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks.Recently, unsupervised prompt tuning methods, such as UPL and POUF, directly leverage pseudo-labels as supervisory information to fine-tune additional adaptation modules on unlabeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, inaccurate pseudo labels easily misguide the tuning process and result in poor representation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>In light of this, we propose Training-Free Unsupervised Prompts (TFUP), which maximally preserves the inherent representation capabilities and enhances them with a residual connection to similarity-based prediction probabilities in a training-free and labeling-free manner.Specifically, we integrate both instance confidence and prototype scores to select representative samples, which are used to customize a reliable Feature Cache Model (FCM) for training-free inference.Then, we design a Multi-level Similarity Measure (MSM) that considers both feature-level and semantic-level similarities to calculate the distance between each test image and the cached sample as the weight of the corresponding cached label to generate similarity-based prediction probabilities.In this way, TFUP achieves surprising performance, even surpassing the training-base method on multiple classification datasets.Based on our TFUP, we propose a training-based approach (TFUP-T) to further boost the adaptation performance.In addition to the standard cross-entropy loss, TFUP-T adopts an additional marginal distribution entropy loss to constrain the model from a global perspective.Our TFUP-T achieves new state-of-the-art classification performance compared to unsupervised and few-shot adaptation approaches on multiple benchmarks.In particular, TFUP-T improves the classification accuracy of POUF by 3.3% on the most challenging Domain-Net dataset.</p>

                  <p>Network function (NF) offloading on SmartNICs has been widely used in modern data centers, offering benefits in host resource saving and programmability.Co-running NFs on the same SmartNICs can cause performance interference due to onboard resource contention.Therefore, to meet performance SLAs while ensuring efficient resource management, operators need mechanisms to predict NF performance under such contention.However, existing solutions lack SmartNIC-specific knowledge and exhibit limited traffic awareness, leading to poor accuracy for on-NIC NFs.This paper proposes Tomur, a novel performance predictive system for on-NIC NFs.Tomur builds upon the key observation that co-located NFs contend for multiple resources, including onboard accelerators and the memory subsystem.It also facilitates traffic awareness according to the behaviors of individual resources to maintain accuracy as the external traffic attributes vary.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation using BlueField-2 SmartNIC shows that Tomur improves the prediction accuracy by 78.8% and reduces SLA violations by 92.2% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and enables new practical usecases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>A common goal in evolutionary multi-objective optimization is to find suitable finite-size approximations of the Pareto front of a given multi-objective optimization problem.While many multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have proven to be very efficient in finding good Pareto front approximations, they may need quite a few resources or may even fail to obtain optimal or nearly approximations.Hereby, optimality is implicitly defined by the chosen performance indicator.In this work, we propose a set-based Newton method for Hausdorff approximations of the Pareto front to be used within multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.To this end, we first generalize the previously proposed Newton step for the performance indicator for the treatment of constrained problems for general reference sets.To approximate the target Pareto front, we propose a particular strategy for generating the reference set that utilizes the data gathered by the evolutionary algorithm during its run.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show the benefit of the Newton method as a post-processing step on several benchmark test functions and different base evolutionary algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a new class of preconditioned iterative methods for solving linear systems of the form $Ax = b$. Our methods are based on constructing a low-rank Nystr\"om approximation to $A$ using sparse random sketching.This approximation is used to construct a preconditioner, which itself is inverted quickly using additional levels of random sketching and preconditioning.We prove that the convergence of our methods depends on a natural average condition number of $A$, which improves as the rank of the Nystr\"om approximation increases.Concretely, this allows us to obtain faster runtimes for a number of fundamental linear algebraic problems:   1.We show how to solve any $n\times n$ linear system that is well-conditioned except for $k$ outlying large singular values in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.065} + k^\omega)$ time, improving on a recent result of [Derezi\'nski, Yang, STOC 2024] for all $k \gtrsim n^{0.78}$.   2.We give the first $\tilde{O}(n^2 + {d_\lambda}^{\omega}$) time algorithm for solving a regularized linear system $(A + \lambda I)x= b$, where $A$ is positive semidefinite with effective dimension $d_\lambda$. This problem arises in applications like Gaussian process regression.   3.We give faster algorithms for approximating Schatten $p$-norms and other matrix norms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, for the Schatten 1 (nuclear) norm, we give an algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.11})$ time, improving on an $\tilde{O}(n^{2.18})$ method of [Musco et al., ITCS 2018].    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Interestingly, previous state-of-the-art algorithms for most of the problems above relied on stochastic iterative methods, like stochastic coordinate and gradient descent.Our work takes a completely different approach, instead leveraging tools from matrix sketching.</p>

                  <p>We study fundamental directed graph (digraph) problems in the streaming model.An initial investigation by Chakrabarti, Ghosh, McGregor, and Vorotnikova [SODA'20] on streaming digraphs showed that while most of these problems are provably hard in general, some of them become tractable when restricted to the well-studied class of tournament graphs where every pair of nodes shares exactly one directed edge.Thus, we focus on tournaments and improve the state of the art for multiple problems in terms of both upper and lower bounds.   Our primary upper bound is a deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm (using $\tilde{O}(n)$ space for $n$-node graphs, where $\tilde{O}(.)$ hides polylog$(n)$ factors) for decomposing a tournament into strongly connected components (SCC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>it improves upon the previously best-known algorithm by Baweja, Jia, and Woodruff <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>[ITCS'22] in terms of both space and passes: for $p\geq 1$, they used $(p+1)$-passes and $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/p})$-space.We further extend our algorithm to digraphs that are close to tournaments and establish tight bounds demonstrating that the problem's complexity grows smoothly with the "distance" from tournaments.Applying our framework, we obtain improved tournament algorithms for $s,t$-reachability, strong connectivity, Hamiltonian paths and cycles, and feedback arc set.   On the other hand, we prove the first $\Omega(n^2)$-space lower bounds for this class, exhibiting that some well-studied problems -- such as (exact) feedback arc set on tournaments (FAST) and $s,t$-distance -- remain hard here.We obtain a generalized lower bound on space-approximation tradeoffs for FAST: any single-pass $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm requires $\Omega(n/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ space.As a whole, our collection of results contributes significantly to the growing literature on streaming digraphs.</p>

                  <p>Numerous applications in biology, statistics, science, and engineering require generating samples from high-dimensional probability distributions.In recent years, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method has emerged as a state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, exploiting the shape of such high-dimensional target distributions to efficiently generate samples.Despite its impressive empirical success and increasing popularity, its wide-scale adoption remains limited due to the high computational cost of gradient calculation.Moreover, applying this method is impossible when the gradient of the posterior cannot be computed (for example, with black-box simulators).To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a surrogate model.In this multi-fidelity algorithm, the acceptance probability is computed in the first stage via a standard HMC proposal using an inexpensive differentiable surrogate model, and if the proposal is accepted, the posterior is evaluated in the second stage using the high-fidelity (HF) numerical solver.Splitting the standard HMC algorithm into these two stages allows for approximating the gradient of the posterior efficiently, while producing accurate posterior samples by using HF numerical solvers in the second stage.We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for a range of problems, including linear and nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with in-silico data and experimental data.The proposed algorithm is shown to seamlessly integrate with various low-fidelity and HF models, priors, and datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms the traditional HMC algorithm in both computational and statistical efficiency by several orders of magnitude, all while retaining or improving the accuracy in computed posterior statistics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are machine learning models specialized for graph data and widely used in many applications.To train GNNs on large graphs that exceed CPU memory, several systems store data on disk and conduct out-of-core processing.However, these systems suffer from either read amplification when reading node features that are usually smaller than a disk page or degraded model accuracy by treating the graph as disconnected partitions.To close this gap, we build a system called DiskGNN, which achieves high I/O efficiency and thus fast training without hurting model accuracy.The key technique used by DiskGNN is offline sampling, which helps decouple graph sampling from model computation.In particular, by conducting graph sampling beforehand, DiskGNN acquires the node features that will be accessed by model computation, and such information is utilized to pack the target node features contiguously on disk to avoid read amplification.Besides, \name{} also adopts designs including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory hierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to accelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk access with other operations.We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN, which are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their best model accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors.Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data.In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships.However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information.Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs.To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN).Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner.Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>"Alert fatigue" is one of the biggest challenges faced by the Security Operations Center (SOC) today, with analysts spending more than half of their time reviewing false alerts.Endpoint detection products raise alerts by pattern matching on event telemetry against behavioral rules that describe potentially malicious behavior, but can suffer from high false positives that distract from actual attacks.While alert triage techniques based on data provenance may show promise, these techniques can take over a minute to inspect a single alert, while EDR customers may face tens of millions of alerts per day; the current reality is that these approaches aren't nearly scalable enough for production environments.   We present Carbon Filter, a statistical learning based system that dramatically reduces the number of alerts analysts need to manually review.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is based on the observation that false alert triggers can be efficiently identified and separated from suspicious behaviors by examining the process initiation context (e.g., the command line) that launched the responsible process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>Through the use of fast-search algorithms for training and inference, our approach scales to millions of alerts per day.Through batching queries to the model, we observe a theoretical maximum throughput of 20 million alerts per hour.Based on the analysis of tens of million alerts from customer deployments, our solution resulted in a 6-fold improvement in the Signal-to-Noise ratio without compromising on alert triage performance.</p>

                  <p>Linkage methods are among the most popular algorithms for hierarchical clustering.Despite their relevance the current knowledge regarding the quality of the clustering produced by these methods is limited.Here, we improve the currently available bounds on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by complete-link for metric spaces.   One of our new bounds, in contrast to the existing ones, allows us to separate complete-link from single-link in terms of approximation for the diameter, which corroborates the common perception that the former is more suitable than the latter when the goal is producing compact clusters.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our techniques can be employed to derive upper bounds on the cohesion of a class of linkage methods that includes the quite popular average-link. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding the non-literal meaning of an utterance is critical for large language models (LLMs) to become human-like social communicators.In this work, we introduce SwordsmanImp, the first Chinese multi-turn-dialogue-based dataset aimed at conversational implicature, sourced from dialogues in the Chinese sitcom $\textit{My Own Swordsman}$.It includes 200 carefully handcrafted questions, all annotated on which Gricean maxims have been violated.We test eight close-source and open-source LLMs under two tasks: a multiple-choice question task and an implicature explanation task.Our results show that GPT-4 attains human-level accuracy (94%) on multiple-choice questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CausalLM demonstrates a 78.5% accuracy following GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Other models, including GPT-3.5 and several open-source models, demonstrate a lower accuracy ranging from 20% to 60% on multiple-choice questions.Human raters were asked to rate the explanation of the implicatures generated by LLMs on their reasonability, logic and fluency.While all models generate largely fluent and self-consistent text, their explanations score low on reasonability except for GPT-4, suggesting that most LLMs cannot produce satisfactory explanations of the implicatures in the conversation.Moreover, we find LLMs' performance does not vary significantly by Gricean maxims, suggesting that LLMs do not seem to process implicatures derived from different maxims differently.Our data and code are available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/llm-pragmatics.</p>

In this work, we thoroughly investigate whether VLP models are commonly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations of a specific pattern for the image modality.To this end, we propose a novel black-box method to generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which is so called the Effective and T ransferable Universal Adversarial Attack (ETU), aiming to mislead a variety of existing VLP models in a range of downstream tasks.The ETU comprehensively takes into account the characteristics of UAPs and the intrinsic cross-modal interactions to generate effective UAPs.Under this regime, the ETU encourages both global and local utilities of UAPs.This benefits the overall utility while reducing interactions between UAP units, improving the transferability.To further enhance the effectiveness and transferability of UAPs, we also design a novel data augmentation method named ScMix.ScMix consists of self-mix and cross-mix data transformations, which can effectively increase the multi-modal data diversity while preserving the semantics of the original data.Through comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve effective and transferrable universal adversarial attacks.</p>

                  <p>Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details.In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions.By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions.This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference.Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens.This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model.Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span></p>

                  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) services necessitate the storage, transmission, and analysis of diverse data for inference, autonomy, and control.Blockchains, with their inherent properties of decentralization and security, offer efficient database solutions for these devices through consensus-based data sharing.However, it's essential to recognize that not every blockchain system is suitable for specific IoT applications, and some might be more beneficial when excluded with privacy concerns.For example, public blockchains are not suitable for storing sensitive data.This paper presents a detailed review of three distinct blockchains tailored for enhancing IoT applications.We initially delve into the foundational aspects of three blockchain systems, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implementation needs.Additionally, we discuss the security issues in different blockchains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we explore the blockchain's application in three pivotal IoT areas: edge AI, communications, and healthcare. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>We underscore potential challenges and the future directions for integrating different blockchains in IoT.

                  <p>Current autonomous driving systems heavily rely on V2X communication data to enhance situational awareness and the cooperation between vehicles.However, a major challenge when using V2X data is that it may not be available periodically because of unpredictable delays and data loss during wireless transmission between road stations and the receiver vehicle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This issue should be considered when designing control strategies for connected and autonomous vehicles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>Therefore, this paper proposes a novel 'Blind Actor-Critic' algorithm that guarantees robust driving performance in V2X environment with delayed and/or lost data.The novel algorithm incorporates three key mechanisms: a virtual fixed sampling period, a combination of Temporal-Difference and Monte Carlo learning, and a numerical approximation of immediate reward values.To address the temporal aperiodicity problem of V2X data, we first illustrate this challenge.Then, we provide a detailed explanation of the Blind Actor-Critic algorithm where we highlight the proposed components to compensate for the temporal aperiodicity problem of V2X data.We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in a simulation environment and compare it to benchmark approaches.The results demonstrate that training metrics are improved compared to conventional actor-critic algorithms.Additionally, testing results show that our approach provides robust control, even under low V2X network reliability levels.</p>

                  <p>Drug discovery is a complex process that involves sequentially screening and examining a vast array of molecules to identify those with the target properties.This process, also referred to as sequential experimentation, faces challenges due to the vast search space, the rarity of target molecules, and constraints imposed by limited data and experimental budgets.To address these challenges, we introduce a human-in-the-loop framework for sequential experiments in drug discovery.This collaborative approach combines human expert knowledge with deep learning algorithms, enhancing the discovery of target molecules within a specified experimental budget.The proposed algorithm processes experimental data to recommend both promising molecules and those that could improve its performance to human experts.Human experts retain the final decision-making authority based on these recommendations and their domain expertise, including the ability to override algorithmic recommendations.We applied our method to drug discovery tasks using real-world data and found that it consistently outperforms all baseline methods, including those which rely solely on human or algorithmic input.This demonstrates the complementarity between human experts and the algorithm.Our results provide key insights into the levels of humans' domain knowledge, the importance of meta-knowledge, and effective work delegation strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that such a framework can significantly accelerate the development of new vaccines and drugs by leveraging the best of both human and artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

                  <p>Aligning machine learning systems with human expectations is mostly attempted by training with manually vetted human behavioral samples, typically explicit feedback.This is done on a population level since the context that is capturing the subjective Point-Of-View (POV) of a concrete person in a specific situational context is not retained in the data.However, we argue that alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably.Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed differently.Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent reasoning processes and observable reactions differ.We hypothesize that individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an individual level.We test this, by integrating perception information into machine learning systems and measuring their predictive performance wrt.~individual subjective assessments.For our empirical study, we collect a novel data set of multimodal stimuli and corresponding eye tracking sequences for the novel task of Perception-Guided Crossmodal Entailment and tackle it with our Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer.Our findings suggest that exploiting individual perception signals for the machine learning of subjective human assessments provides a valuable cue for individual alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It does not only improve the overall predictive performance from the point-of-view of the individual user but might also contribute to steering AI systems towards every person's individual expectations and values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span></p>
