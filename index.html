                  <p>Members of the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) communities have proposed Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising resource for robotics tasks such as natural language interactions, doing household and workplace tasks, approximating `common sense reasoning', and modeling humans.However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications.To address these concerns, we conduct an HRI-based evaluation of discrimination and safety criteria on several highly-rated LLMs.Our evaluation reveals that LLMs currently lack robustness when encountering people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics (e.g., race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections), producing biased outputs consistent with directly discriminatory outcomes -- e.g. `gypsy' and `mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not `european' or `able-bodied' people.Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions -- such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation.Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code will be made available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span></p>

                  <p>The latest breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), eg., ChatDev, have catalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent collaboration for software development.LLM agents can collaborate in teams like humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on requirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to perform autonomous software generation.However, for an agent team, each phase in a single development process yields only one possible outcome.This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space.Consequently, this may lead to obtaining suboptimal results.To address this challenge, we introduce Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation.Experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of our framework.The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our framework across various domains.We anticipate that our work will guide LLM agents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth in but not limited to software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications such as image recognition and visual reasoning, and have also shown promising potential in specialized domains.However, the application potential of LVLMs in the insurance domain-characterized by rich application scenarios and abundant multimodal data-has not been effectively explored.There is no systematic review of multimodal tasks in the insurance domain, nor a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance.This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance domain.In this paper, we systematically review and distill multimodal tasks for four representative types of insurance: auto insurance, property insurance, health insurance, and agricultural insurance.We propose INS-MMBench, the first comprehensive LVLMs benchmark tailored for the insurance domain.INS-MMBench comprises a total of 2.2K thoroughly designed multiple-choice questions, covering 12 meta-tasks and 22 fundamental tasks.Furthermore, we evaluate multiple representative LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like BLIP-2.This evaluation not only validates the effectiveness of our benchmark but also provides an in-depth performance analysis of current LVLMs on various multimodal tasks in the insurance domain.We hope that INS-MMBench will facilitate the further application of LVLMs in the insurance domain and inspire interdisciplinary development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/FDU-INS/INS-MMBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding inter-object relations, i.e., interactions or associations between distinct objects, remains a major challenge for such models.This issue significantly hinders their advanced reasoning capabilities and is primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse multi-modal data essential for training and evaluating MLLMs.In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of inter-object relations and introduce Multi-Modal Relation Understanding (MMRel), a comprehensive dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing large-scale, high-quality and diverse data for studying inter-object relations with MLLMs.MMRel features three distinctive attributes: (i) It includes over 15K question-answer pairs, which are sourced from three distinct domains, ensuring large scale and high diversity; (ii) It contains a subset featuring highly unusual relations, on which MLLMs often fail due to hallucinations, thus are very challenging; (iii) It provides manually verified high-quality labels for inter-object relations.Thanks to these features, MMRel is ideal for evaluating MLLMs on relation understanding, as well as being used to fine-tune MLLMs to enhance relation understanding and even benefit overall performance in various vision-language tasks.Extensive experiments on various popular MLLMs validate the effectiveness of MMRel.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both MMRel dataset and the complete labeling scripts have been made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.88</span></span></p>

                  <p>The quality of Virtual Reality (VR) apps is vital, particularly the rendering quality of the VR Graphical User Interface (GUI).Different from traditional 2D apps, VR apps create a 3D digital scene for users, by rendering two distinct 2D images for the user's left and right eyes, respectively.Stereoscopic visual inconsistency (denoted as "SVI") issues, however, undermine the rendering process of the user's brain, leading to user discomfort and even adverse health effects.Such issues commonly exist but remain underexplored.We conduct an empirical analysis on 282 SVI bug reports from 15 VR platforms, summarizing 15 types of manifestations.The empirical analysis reveals that automatically detecting SVI issues is challenging, mainly because: (1) lack of training data; (2) the manifestations of SVI issues are diverse, complicated, and often application-specific; (3) most accessible VR apps are closed-source commercial software.Existing pattern-based supervised classification approaches may be inapplicable or ineffective in detecting the SVI issues.To counter these challenges, we propose an unsupervised black-box testing framework named StereoID to identify the stereoscopic visual inconsistencies, based only on the rendered GUI states.StereoID generates a synthetic right-eye image based on the actual left-eye image and computes distances between the synthetic right-eye image and the actual right-eye image to detect SVI issues.We propose a depth-aware conditional stereo image translator to power the image generation process, which captures the expected perspective shifts between left-eye and right-eye images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build a large-scale unlabeled VR stereo screenshot dataset with larger than 171K images from 288 real-world VR apps for experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>After substantial experiments, StereoID demonstrates superior performance for detecting SVI issues in both user reports and wild VR apps.</p>

                  <p>Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is important for video enhancement, frame rate up-conversion, and slow-motion generation.The introduction of event cameras, which capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, has significantly enhanced VFI capabilities, particularly for high-speed, nonlinear motions.However, these event-based methods encounter challenges in low-light conditions, notably trailing artifacts and signal latency, which hinder their direct applicability and generalization.Addressing these issues, we propose a novel per-scene optimization strategy tailored for low-light conditions.This approach utilizes the internal statistics of a sequence to handle degraded event data under low-light conditions, improving the generalizability to different lighting and camera settings.To evaluate its robustness in low-light condition, we further introduce EVFI-LL, a unique RGB+Event dataset captured under low-light conditions.Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in low-light environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span>Project page: https://naturezhanghn.github.io/sim2real.</p>

                  <p>Seeing clearly with high resolution is a foundation of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which has been proven to be vital for visual perception and reasoning.Existing works usually employ a straightforward resolution upscaling method, where the image consists of global and local branches, with the latter being the sliced image patches but resized to the same resolution as the former.This means that higher resolution requires more local patches, resulting in exorbitant computational expenses, and meanwhile, the dominance of local image tokens may diminish the global context.In this paper, we dive into the problems and propose a new framework as well as an elaborate optimization strategy.Specifically, we extract contextual information from the global view using a mixture of adapters, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks.With regard to local patches, learnable query embeddings are introduced to reduce image tokens, the most important tokens accounting for the user question will be further selected by a similarity-based selector.Our empirical results demonstrate a `less is more' pattern, where \textit{utilizing fewer but more informative local image tokens leads to improved performance}.Besides, a significant challenge lies in the training strategy, as simultaneous end-to-end training of the global mining block and local compression block does not yield optimal results.We thus advocate for an alternating training way, ensuring balanced learning between global and local aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we also introduce a challenging dataset with high requirements for image detail, enhancing the training of the local compression layer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>The proposed method, termed LMM with Sophisticated Tasks, Local image compression, and Mixture of global Experts (SliME), achieves leading performance across various benchmarks with only 2 million training data.</p>

                  <p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are indispensable for perception tasks of autonomous vehicles, thanks to their resilience in challenging weather conditions.Yet, their deployment is often limited by insufficient spatial resolution for precise semantic scene interpretation.Classical super-resolution techniques adapted from optical imaging inadequately address the distinct characteristics of radar signal data.In response, our study redefines radar imaging super-resolution as a one-dimensional (1D) signal super-resolution spectra estimation problem by harnessing the radar signal processing domain knowledge, introducing innovative data normalization and a domain-informed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-guided loss function.Our tailored deep learning network for automotive radar imaging exhibits remarkable scalability, parameter efficiency and fast inference speed, alongside enhanced performance in terms of radar imaging quality and resolution.Extensive testing confirms that our SR-SPECNet sets a new benchmark in producing high-resolution radar range-azimuth images, outperforming existing methods across varied antenna configurations and dataset sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code and new radar dataset will be made publicly available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

Spatiotemporal Traffic Data (STTD) measures the complex dynamical behaviors of the multiscale transportation system.Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models.However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations.Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation.To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables.To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes.We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding.Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics.It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns.We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks.$\textbf{The full version can be found at:}$ https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.03185.</p>

                How Powerful is Graph Filtering for Recommendation

                  <p>It has been shown that the effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for recommendation is attributed to the spectral graph filtering.Most GCN-based methods consist of a graph filter or followed by a low-rank mapping optimized based on supervised training.However, we show two limitations suppressing the power of graph filtering: (1) Lack of generality.Due to the varied noise distribution, graph filters fail to denoise sparse data where noise is scattered across all frequencies, while supervised training results in worse performance on dense data where noise is concentrated in middle frequencies that can be removed by graph filters without training.(2) Lack of expressive power.We theoretically show that linear GCN (LGCN) that is effective on collaborative filtering (CF) cannot generate arbitrary embeddings, implying the possibility that optimal data representation might be unreachable.   To tackle the first limitation, we show close relation between noise distribution and the sharpness of spectrum where a sharper spectral distribution is more desirable causing data noise to be separable from important features without training.Based on this observation, we propose a generalized graph normalization G^2N to adjust the sharpness of spectral distribution in order to redistribute data noise to assure that it can be removed by graph filtering without training.As for the second limitation, we propose an individualized graph filter (IGF) adapting to the different confidence levels of the user preference that interactions can reflect, which is proved to be able to generate arbitrary embeddings.By simplifying LGCN, we further propose a simplified graph filtering (SGFCF) which only requires the top-K singular values for recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, experimental results on four datasets with different density settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fused Magnesium Furnace (FMF) is a crucial industrial equipment in the production of magnesia, and anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficient, stable, and secure operation.Existing anomaly detection methods primarily focus on analyzing dominant anomalies using the process variables (such as arc current) or constructing neural networks based on abnormal visual features, while overlooking the intrinsic correlation of cross-modal information.This paper proposes a cross-modal Transformer (dubbed FmFormer), designed to facilitate anomaly detection in fused magnesium smelting processes by exploring the correlation between visual features (video) and process variables (current).Our approach introduces a novel tokenization paradigm to effectively bridge the substantial dimensionality gap between the 3D video modality and the 1D current modality in a multiscale manner, enabling a hierarchical reconstruction of pixel-level anomaly detection.Subsequently, the FmFormer leverages self-attention to learn internal features within each modality and bidirectional cross-attention to capture correlations across modalities.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also present a pioneering cross-modal benchmark of the fused magnesium smelting process, featuring synchronously acquired video and current data for over 2.2 million samples.Leveraging cross-modal learning, the proposed FmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting anomalies, particularly under extreme interferences such as current fluctuations and visual occlusion caused by heavy water mist.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The presented methodology and benchmark may be applicable to other industrial applications with some amendments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark will be released at https://github.com/GaochangWu/FMF-Benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>On the GPU, hash table operation speed is determined in large part by cache line efficiency, and state-of-the-art hashing schemes thus divide tables into cache line-sized buckets.This raises the question whether performance can be further improved by increasing the number of entries that fit in such buckets.Known compact hashing techniques have not yet been adapted to the massively parallel setting, nor have they been evaluated on the GPU.We consider a compact version of bucketed cuckoo hashing, and a version of compact iceberg hashing suitable for the GPU.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss the tables from a theoretical perspective, and provide an open source implementation of both schemes in CUDA for comparative benchmarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>In terms of performance, the state-of-the-art cuckoo hashing benefits from compactness on lookups and insertions (most experiments show at least 10-20% increase in throughput), and the iceberg table benefits significantly, to the point of being comparable to compact cuckoo hashing--while supporting performant dynamic operation.</p>

                  <p>While imitation learning requires access to high-quality data, offline reinforcement learning (RL) should, in principle, perform similarly or better with substantially lower data quality by using a value function.However, current results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation learning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline RL.Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in current offline RL algorithms.While poor performance of offline RL is typically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: is the main bottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something else?To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1) value learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline RL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance.We make two surprising observations.First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction algorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL, often more so than the value learning objective.For instance, we show that common value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully leverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained policy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial improvements in performance and scalability.Second, we find that a big barrier to improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on test-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy learning on in-distribution states.We then show that the use of suboptimal but high-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this generalization issue in practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we propose two simple test-time policy improvement methods and show that these methods lead to better performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span></p>

                  <p>Distributed databases are fundamental infrastructures of today's large-scale software systems such as cloud systems.Detecting anomalies in distributed databases is essential for maintaining software availability.Existing approaches, predominantly developed using Loghub-a comprehensive collection of log datasets from various systems-lack datasets specifically tailored to distributed databases, which exhibit unique anomalies.Additionally, there's a notable absence of datasets encompassing multi-anomaly, multi-node logs.Consequently, models built upon these datasets, primarily designed for standalone systems, are inadequate for distributed databases, and the prevalent method of deeming an entire cluster anomalous based on irregularities in a single node leads to a high false-positive rate.This paper addresses the unique anomalies and multivariate nature of logs in distributed databases.We expose the first open-sourced, comprehensive dataset with multivariate logs from distributed databases.Utilizing this dataset, we conduct an extensive study to identify multiple database anomalies and to assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art anomaly detection using multivariate log data.Our findings reveal that relying solely on logs from a single node is insufficient for accurate anomaly detection on distributed database.Leveraging these insights, we propose MultiLog, an innovative multivariate log-based anomaly detection approach tailored for distributed databases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments, based on this novel dataset, demonstrate MultiLog's superiority, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by approximately 12%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) have been widely utilized to address resource allocation problems with Markov reward processes (MRPs).Existing works often assume that the dynamics of MRPs are known prior, which makes the RMAB problem solvable from an optimization perspective.Nevertheless, an efficient learning-based solution for RMABs with unknown system dynamics remains an open problem.In this paper, we study the cooperative resource allocation problem with unknown system dynamics of MRPs.This problem can be modeled as a multi-agent online RMAB problem, where multiple agents collaboratively learn the system dynamics while maximizing their accumulated rewards.We devise a federated online RMAB framework to mitigate the communication overhead and data privacy issue by adopting the federated learning paradigm.Based on this framework, we put forth a Federated Thompson Sampling-enabled Whittle Index (FedTSWI) algorithm to solve this multi-agent online RMAB problem.The FedTSWI algorithm enjoys a high communication and computation efficiency, and a privacy guarantee.Moreover, we derive a regret upper bound for the FedTSWI algorithm.Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the case of online multi-user multi-channel access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ and better performance compared with baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>More importantly, its sample complexity decreases with the number of agents.</p>

                  <p>Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics.Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods).In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches.The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases.The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tabular synthesis models remain ineffective at capturing complex dependencies, and the quality of synthetic data is still insufficient for comprehensive downstream tasks, such as prediction under distribution shifts, automated decision-making, and cross-table understanding.A major challenge is the lack of prior knowledge about underlying structures and high-order relationships in tabular data.We argue that a systematic evaluation on high-order structural information for tabular data synthesis is the first step towards solving the problem.In this paper, we introduce high-order structural causal information as natural prior knowledge and provide a benchmark framework for the evaluation of tabular synthesis models.The framework allows us to generate benchmark datasets with a flexible range of data generation processes and to train tabular synthesis models using these datasets for further evaluation.We propose multiple benchmark tasks, high-order metrics, and causal inference tasks as downstream tasks for evaluating the quality of synthetic data generated by the trained models.Our experiments demonstrate to leverage the benchmark framework for evaluating the model capability of capturing high-order structural causal information.Furthermore, our benchmarking results provide an initial assessment of state-of-the-art tabular synthesis models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They have clearly revealed significant gaps between ideal and actual performance and how baseline methods differ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark framework is available at URL https://github.com/TURuibo/CauTabBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs).Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights, their alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI.High human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent existing open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively, potentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets.Is it possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM?We present a self-synthesis method for generating large-scale alignment data named Magpie.Our key observation is that aligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only the left-side templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks to their auto-regressive nature.We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct and generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses.We perform a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data and select 300K high-quality instances.To compare Magpie data with other public instruction datasets, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models.Our results indicate that in some tasks, models fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and subsequent feedback learning.We also show that using Magpie solely for SFT can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This advantage is evident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, multiple models proposed for link prediction (LP) demonstrate impressive results on benchmark datasets.However, many popular benchmark datasets often assume that dataset samples are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., IID samples).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; since uncontrolled factors may lead train and test samples to come from separate distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>To tackle the distribution shift problem, recent work focuses on creating datasets that feature distribution shifts and designing generalization methods that perform well on the new data.However, those studies only consider distribution shifts that affect {\it node-} and {\it graph-level} tasks, thus ignoring link-level tasks.Furthermore, relatively few LP generalization methods exist.To bridge this gap, we introduce a set of LP-specific data splits which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift.We verify the shift's effect empirically through evaluation of different SOTA LP methods and subsequently couple these methods with generalization techniques.Interestingly, LP-specific methods frequently generalize poorly relative to heuristics or basic GNN methods.Finally, this work provides analysis to uncover insights for enhancing LP generalization.Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/revolins/LPStructGen}{https://github.com/revolins/LPStructGen}</p>

                  <p>One of the predominant methods for training world models is autoregressive prediction in the output space of the next element of a sequence.In Natural Language Processing (NLP), this takes the form of Large Language Models (LLMs) predicting the next token; in Computer Vision (CV), this takes the form of autoregressive models predicting the next frame/token/pixel.However, this approach differs from human cognition in several respects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, human predictions about the future actively influence internal cognitive processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>Second, humans naturally evaluate the plausibility of predictions regarding future states.Based on this capability, and third, by assessing when predictions are sufficient, humans allocate a dynamic amount of time to make a prediction.This adaptive process is analogous to System 2 thinking in psychology.All these capabilities are fundamental to the success of humans at high-level reasoning and planning.Therefore, to address the limitations of traditional autoregressive models lacking these human-like capabilities, we introduce Energy-Based World Models (EBWM).EBWM involves training an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to predict the compatibility of a given context and a predicted future state.In doing so, EBWM enables models to achieve all three facets of human cognition described.Moreover, we developed a variant of the traditional autoregressive transformer tailored for Energy-Based models, termed the Energy-Based Transformer (EBT).Our results demonstrate that EBWM scales better with data and GPU Hours than traditional autoregressive transformers in CV, and that EBWM offers promising early scaling in NLP.Consequently, this approach offers an exciting path toward training future models capable of System 2 thinking and intelligently searching across state spaces.</p>

                  <p>Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit "hallucinations," samples that could never occur in the training data.But where do such hallucinations come from?In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation.Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly "interpolate" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations.Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed.Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate.This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process.Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples.We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset.We release our code at https://github.com/locuslab/diffusion-model-hallucination.</p>

We present a new formulation of this problem, assuming that nodes adjust their opinions according to the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics.We demonstrate that selecting $k$ stooges for maximizing and minimizing the MSE is NP-hard.We also demonstrate that our formulation is closely related to maximizing or minimizing polarization and show NP-hardness.We propose an efficient greedy heuristic that scales to large networks and test our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets.Although MSE and polarization objectives differ, we find in practice that maximizing polarization often yields solutions that are nearly optimal for minimizing the wisdom of crowds in terms of MSE.Our analysis of real-world data reveals that even a small number of stooges can significantly influence the conversation on the war in Ukraine, resulting in a relative increase of the MSE of 207.80% (maximization) or a decrease of 50.62% (minimization).</p>

                  <p>To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences.Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs.To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner.This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalized recommender systems, the challenge of adapting to evolving user preferences and the continuous influx of new users and items is paramount.Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands.Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution.However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies.To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation.Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views.After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph.Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views.These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated.Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</p>

                  <p>Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common.It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries.In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score.Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation.We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not.Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated.Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures.We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID.Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.</p>

                  <p>Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities.When domain distribution changes, the fragility of subtle features leads to a pronounced deterioration in model performance.Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning both the commonality and specificity within categories.Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG.Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is achieved through a decorrelation function on disentangled segments, constraints on common feature consistency, specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration operation across granularities.By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories.Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.1% in terms of FGDG performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond that, the explainability analysis and experiments on various mainstream model architectures confirm the validity of FS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change.Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations.These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections.Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard.However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation.We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training.First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered.Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features.We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning models often incorporate vast amounts of data, raising significant privacy concerns.Machine unlearning, the ability to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, addresses these concerns.This paper explores practical methods for implementing machine unlearning, focusing on a first-epoch gradient-ascent approach.   Key findings include: 1.Single vs. Multi-Epoch Unlearning: First-epoch gradient unlearning is more effective than multi-epoch gradients.2. Layer-Based Unlearning: The embedding layer in GPT-2 is crucial for effective unlearning.Gradients from the output layers (11 and 12) have no impact.Efficient unlearning can be achieved using only the embedding layer, halving space complexity.3. Influence Functions & Scoring: Techniques like Hessian Vector Product and the dot product of activations and tensors are used for quantifying unlearning.4. Gradient Ascent Considerations: Calibration is necessary to avoid overexposing the model to specific data points during unlearning, which could prematurely terminate the process.5.Fuzzy Matching vs. IterativeUnlearning:Fuzzy matching techniques shift the model to a new optimum, while iterative unlearning provides a more complete modality.   Our empirical evaluation confirms that first-epoch gradient ascent for machine unlearning is more effective than whole-model gradient ascent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the potential of machine unlearning for enhancing data privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>The study underscores the importance of formal methods to comprehensively evaluate the unlearning process.</p>

                  <p>In 1907, Sir Francis Galton independently asked 787 villagers to estimate the weight of an ox.Although none of them guessed the exact weight, the average estimate was remarkably accurate.This phenomenon is known as wisdom of crowds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In a clever experiment, Asch employed actors to demonstrate the human tendency to conform to others' opinions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>The question we ask is: what would Sir Francis Galton have observed if Asch had interfered by employing actors?Would the wisdom of crowds become even wiser or not?The problem becomes intriguing when considering the inter-connectedness of the villagers, which is the central theme of this work.We examine a scenario where $n$ agents are interconnected and influence each other.The average of their opinions provides an estimator of a certain quality for some unknown quantity.How can one improve or reduce the quality of the original estimator in terms of the MSE by utilizing Asch's strategy of hiring a few stooges?   We present a new formulation of this problem, assuming that nodes adjust their opinions according to the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics.We demonstrate that selecting $k$ stooges for maximizing and minimizing the MSE is NP-hard.We also demonstrate that our formulation is closely related to maximizing or minimizing polarization and show NP-hardness.We propose an efficient greedy heuristic that scales to large networks and test our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets.Although MSE and polarization objectives differ, we find in practice that maximizing polarization often yields solutions that are nearly optimal for minimizing the wisdom of crowds in terms of MSE.Our analysis of real-world data reveals that even a small number of stooges can significantly influence the conversation on the war in Ukraine, resulting in a relative increase of the MSE of 207.80% (maximization) or a decrease of 50.62% (minimization).</p>

                  <p>Effective teaching relies on knowing what students know-or think they know.Revealing student thinking is challenging.Often used because of their ease of grading, even the best multiple choice (MC) tests, those using research based distractors (wrong answers) are intrinsically limited in the insights they provide due to two factors.When distractors do not reflect student beliefs they can be ignored, increasing the likelihood that the correct answer will be chosen by chance.Moreover, making the correct choice does not guarantee that the student understands why it is correct.To address these limitations, we recommend asking students to explain why they chose their answer, and why "wrong" choices are wrong.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a discipline-trained artificial intelligence-based bot it is possible to analyze their explanations, identifying the concepts and scientific principles that maybe missing or misapplied. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>The bot also makes suggestions for how instructors can use these data to better guide student thinking.In a small "proof of concept" study, we tested this approach using questions from the Biology Concepts Instrument (BCI).The result was rapid, informative, and provided actionable feedback on student thinking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It appears that the use of AI addresses the weaknesses of conventional MC test. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>It seems likely that incorporating AI-analyzed formative assessments will lead to improved overall learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Modern voice cloning models claim to be able to capture a diverse range of voices.We test the ability of a typical pipeline to capture the style known colloquially as "gay voice" and notice a homogenisation effect: synthesised speech is rated as sounding significantly "less gay" (by LGBTQ+ participants) than its corresponding ground-truth for speakers with "gay voice", but ratings actually increase for control speakers.Loss of "gay voice" has implications for accessibility.We also find that for speakers with "gay voice", loss of "gay voice" corresponds to lower similarity ratings.   However, we caution that improving the ability of such models to synthesise ``gay voice'' comes with a great number of risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use this pipeline as a starting point for a discussion on the ethics of modelling queer voices more broadly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.582</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Collecting "clean" queer data has safety and fairness ramifications, and the resulting technology may cause harms from mockery to death. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have received significant attention in recent years in the robotics community.VLMs are shown to be able to perform complex visual reasoning and scene understanding tasks, which makes them regarded as a potential universal solution for general robotics problems such as manipulation and navigation.However, previous VLMs for robotics such as RT-1, RT-2, and ManipLLM~ have focused on directly learning robot-centric actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such approaches require collecting a significant amount of robot interaction data, which is extremely costly in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Thus, we propose A3VLM, an object-centric, actionable, articulation-aware vision language model.A3VLM focuses on the articulation structure and action affordances of objects.Its representation is robot-agnostic and can be translated into robot actions using simple action primitives.Extensive experiments in both simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of A3VLM.We release our code and other materials at https://github.com/changhaonan/A3VLM.</p>
