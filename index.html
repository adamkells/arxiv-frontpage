                  <p>Automatic extraction of information from publications is key to making scientific knowledge machine readable at a large scale.The extracted information can, for example, facilitate academic search, decision making, and knowledge graph construction.An important type of information not covered by existing approaches is hyperparameters.In this paper, we formalize and tackle hyperparameter information extraction (HyperPIE) as an entity recognition and relation extraction task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We create a labeled data set covering publications from a variety of computer science disciplines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Using this data set, we train and evaluate BERT-based fine-tuned models as well as five large language models: GPT-3.5, GALACTICA, Falcon, Vicuna, and WizardLM.For fine-tuned models, we develop a relation extraction approach that achieves an improvement of 29% F1 over a state-of-the-art baseline.For large language models, we develop an approach leveraging YAML output for structured data extraction, which achieves an average improvement of 5.5% F1 in entity recognition over using JSON.With our best performing model we extract hyperparameter information from a large number of unannotated papers, and analyze patterns across disciplines.All our data and source code is publicly available at https://github.com/IllDepence/hyperpie</p>

                  <p>Intent classification is a fundamental task in natural language understanding, aiming to categorize user queries or sentences into predefined classes to understand user intent.The most challenging aspect of this particular task lies in effectively incorporating all possible classes of intent into a dataset while ensuring adequate linguistic variation.Plenty of research has been conducted in the related domains in rich-resource languages like English.In this study, we introduce BNIntent30, a comprehensive Bengali intent classification dataset containing 30 intent classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is excerpted and translated from the CLINIC150 dataset containing a diverse range of user intents categorized over 150 classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for Bengali intent classification using Generative Adversarial BERT to evaluate the proposed dataset, which we call GAN-BnBERT.Our approach leverages the power of BERT-based contextual embeddings to capture salient linguistic features and contextual information from the text data, while the generative adversarial network (GAN) component complements the model's ability to learn diverse representations of existing intent classes through generative modeling.Our experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-BnBERT model achieves superior performance on the newly introduced BNIntent30 dataset, surpassing the existing Bi-LSTM and the stand-alone BERT-based classification model.</p>

                  <p>Embedding Human and Articulated Object Interaction (HAOI) in 3D is an important direction for a deeper human activity understanding.Different from previous works that use parametric and CAD models to represent humans and objects, in this work, we propose a novel 3D geometric primitive-based language to encode both humans and objects.Given our new paradigm, humans and objects are all compositions of primitives instead of heterogeneous entities.Thus, mutual information learning may be achieved between the limited 3D data of humans and different object categories.Moreover, considering the simplicity of the expression and the richness of the information it contains, we choose the superquadric as the primitive representation.To explore an effective embedding of HAOI for the machine, we build a new benchmark on 3D HAOI consisting of primitives together with their images and propose a task requiring machines to recover 3D HAOI using primitives from images.Moreover, we propose a baseline of single-view 3D reconstruction on HAOI.We believe this primitive-based 3D HAOI representation would pave the way for 3D HAOI studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/p3haoi. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Tigray War was an armed conflict that took place primarily in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia from November 3, 2020 to November 2, 2022.Given the importance of agriculture in Tigray to livelihoods and food security, determining the impact of the war on cultivated area is critical, but quantifying this impact was difficult due to restricted movement within and into the region due to conflict-driven insecurity and blockages.Using satellite imagery and statistical area estimation techniques, we assessed changes in crop cultivation area in Tigray before and during the war.Our findings show that cultivated area was largely stable between 2020-2021 despite the widespread impacts of the war.We estimated 1,132,000 +/- 133,000 hectares of cultivation in pre-war 2020 compared to 1,217,000<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>+/- 132,000 hectares in mid-war 2021. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Comparing changes inside and outside of a 5 km buffer around conflict events, we found a slightly higher upper confidence limit of cropland loss within the buffer (0-3%) compared to outside the buffer (0-1%).Our results support other reports that despite widespread war-related disruptions, Tigrayan farmers were largely able to sustain cultivation.Our study demonstrates the capability of remote sensing combined with machine learning and statistical techniques to provide timely, transparent area estimates for monitoring food security in regions inaccessible due to conflict.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a learning-based image fragment pair-searching and -matching approach to solve the challenging restoration problem.Existing works use rule-based methods to match similar contour shapes or textures, which are always difficult to tune hyperparameters for extensive data and computationally time-consuming.Therefore, we propose a neural network that can effectively utilize neighbor textures with contour shape information to fundamentally improve performance.First, we employ a graph-based network to extract the local contour and texture features of fragments.Then, for the pair-searching task, we adopt a linear transformer-based module to integrate these local features and use contrastive loss to encode the global features of each fragment.For the pair-matching task, we design a weighted fusion module to dynamically fuse extracted local contour and texture features, and formulate a similarity matrix for each pair of fragments to calculate the matching score and infer the adjacent segment of contours.To faithfully evaluate our proposed network, we created a new image fragment dataset through an algorithm we designed that tears complete images into irregular fragments.The experimental results show that our proposed network achieves excellent pair-searching accuracy, reduces matching errors, and significantly reduces computational time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Details, sourcecode, and data are available in our supplementary material. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, such as the Stanford Natural Language Inference and the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference, coupled with the advent of pre-trained language models, has significantly contributed to the development of the natural language inference domain.However, these crowdsourced annotated datasets often contain biases or dataset artifacts, leading to overestimated model performance and poor generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we focus on investigating dataset artifacts and developing strategies to address these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>Through the utilization of a novel statistical testing procedure, we discover a significant association between vocabulary distribution and text entailment classes, emphasizing vocabulary as a notable source of biases.To mitigate these issues, we propose several automatic data augmentation strategies spanning character to word levels.By fine-tuning the ELECTRA pre-trained language model, we compare the performance of boosted models with augmented data against their baseline counterparts.The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively enhance model accuracy and reduce biases by up to 0.66% and 1.14%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Cross-lingual cross-modal retrieval has garnered increasing attention recently, which aims to achieve the alignment between vision and target language (V-T) without using any annotated V-T data pairs.Current methods employ machine translation (MT) to construct pseudo-parallel data pairs, which are then used to learn a multi-lingual and multi-modal embedding space that aligns visual and target-language representations.However, the large heterogeneous gap between vision and text, along with the noise present in target language translations, poses significant challenges in effectively aligning their representations.To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, Cross-Lingual to Cross-Modal (CL2CM), which improves the alignment between vision and target language using cross-lingual transfer.This approach allows us to fully leverage the merits of multi-lingual pre-trained models (e.g., mBERT) and the benefits of the same modality structure, i.e., smaller gap, to provide reliable and comprehensive semantic correspondence (knowledge) for the cross-modal network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our proposed approach on two multilingual image-text datasets, Multi30K and MSCOCO, and one video-text dataset, VATEX. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and its high potential for large-scale retrieval.</p>

                  <p>A timely software update is vital to combat the increasing security vulnerabilities.However, some software vendors may secretly patch their vulnerabilities without creating CVE entries or even describing the security issue in their change log.Thus, it is critical to identify these hidden security patches and defeat potential N-day attacks.Researchers have employed various machine learning techniques to identify security patches in open-source software, leveraging the syntax and semantic features of the software changes and commit messages.However, all these solutions cannot be directly applied to the binary code, whose instructions and program flow may dramatically vary due to different compilation configurations.In this paper, we propose BinGo, a new security patch detection system for binary code.The main idea is to present the binary code as code property graphs to enable a comprehensive understanding of program flow and perform a language model over each basic block of binary code to catch the instruction semantics.BinGo consists of four phases, namely, patch data pre-processing, graph extraction, embedding generation, and graph representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the lack of an existing binary security patch dataset, we construct such a dataset by compiling the pre-patch and post-patch source code of the Linux kernel. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.924</span></span>Our experimental results show BinGo can achieve up to 80.77% accuracy in identifying security patches between two neighboring versions of binary code.Moreover, BinGo can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives caused by the different compilers and optimization levels.</p>

                  <p>Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging task due to the complex degradation caused by underwater environments.To solve this issue, previous methods often idealize the degradation process, and neglect the impact of medium noise and object motion on the distribution of image features, limiting the generalization and adaptability of the model.Previous methods use the reference gradient that is constructed from original images and synthetic ground-truth images.This may cause the network performance to be influenced by some low-quality training data.Our approach utilizes predicted images to dynamically update pseudo-labels, adding a dynamic gradient to optimize the network's gradient space.This process improves image quality and avoids local optima.Moreover, we propose a Feature Restoration and Reconstruction module (FRR) based on a Channel Combination Inference (CCI) strategy and a Frequency Domain Smoothing module (FRS).These modules decouple other degradation features while reducing the impact of various types of noise on network performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially in achieving performance milestones: PSNR of 25.6dB and SSIM of 0.93 on the UIEB dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>Its efficiency in terms of parameter size and inference time further attests to its broad practicality.The code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Detecting human-object interactions (HOI) in a few-shot setting remains a challenge.Existing meta-learning methods struggle to extract representative features for classification due to the limited data, while existing few-shot HOI models rely on HOI text labels for classification.Moreover, some query images may display visual similarity to those outside their class, such as similar backgrounds between different HOI classes.This makes learning more challenging, especially with limited samples.Bongard-HOI (Jiang et al. 2022) epitomizes this HOI few-shot problem, making it the benchmark we focus on in this paper.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our proposed method, we introduce novel label-uncertain query augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the query inputs, aiming to distinguish the positive HOI class from the negative ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>As these augmented inputs may or may not have the same class label as the original inputs, their class label is unknown.Those belonging to a different class become hard samples due to their visual similarity to the original ones.Additionally, we introduce a novel pseudo-label generation technique that enables a mean teacher model to learn from the augmented label-uncertain inputs.We propose to augment the negative support set for the student model to enrich the semantic information, fostering diversity that challenges and enhances the student's learning.Experimental results demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by achieving 68.74% accuracy on the Bongard-HOI benchmark, a significant improvement over the existing SOTA of 66.59%.In our evaluation on HICO-FS, a more general few-shot recognition dataset, our method achieves 73.27% accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA of 71.20% in the 5-way 5-shot task.</p>

                  <p>Class-agnostic motion prediction methods aim to comprehend motion within open-world scenarios, holding significance for autonomous driving systems.However, training a high-performance model in a fully-supervised manner always requires substantial amounts of manually annotated data, which can be both expensive and time-consuming to obtain.To address this challenge, our study explores the potential of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for class-agnostic motion prediction.Our SSL framework adopts a consistency-based self-training paradigm, enabling the model to learn from unlabeled data by generating pseudo labels through test-time inference.To improve the quality of pseudo labels, we propose a novel motion selection and re-generation module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This module effectively selects reliable pseudo labels and re-generates unreliable ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Furthermore, we propose two data augmentation strategies: temporal sampling and BEVMix.These strategies facilitate consistency regularization in SSL.Experiments conducted on nuScenes demonstrate that our SSL method can surpass the self-supervised approach by a large margin by utilizing only a tiny fraction of labeled data.Furthermore, our method exhibits comparable performance to weakly and some fully supervised methods.These results highlight the ability of our method to strike a favorable balance between annotation costs and performance.Code will be available at https://github.com/kwwcv/SSMP.</p>

                  <p>As the size of the datasets getting larger, accurately annotating such datasets is becoming more impractical due to the expensiveness on both time and economy.Therefore, crowd-sourcing has been widely adopted to alleviate the cost of collecting labels, which also inevitably introduces label noise and eventually degrades the performance of the model.To learn from crowd-sourcing annotations, modeling the expertise of each annotator is a common but challenging paradigm, because the annotations collected by crowd-sourcing are usually highly-sparse.To alleviate this problem, we propose Coupled Confusion Correction (CCC), where two models are simultaneously trained to correct the confusion matrices learned by each other.Via bi-level optimization, the confusion matrices learned by one model can be corrected by the distilled data from the other.Moreover, we cluster the ``annotator groups'' who share similar expertise so that their confusion matrices could be corrected together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this way, the expertise of the annotators, especially of those who provide seldom labels, could be better captured. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, we point out that the annotation sparsity not only means the average number of labels is low, but also there are always some annotators who provide very few labels, which is neglected by previous works when constructing synthetic crowd-sourcing annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Based on that, we propose to use Beta distribution to control the generation of the crowd-sourcing labels so that the synthetic annotations could be more consistent with the real-world ones.Extensive experiments are conducted on two types of synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets, the results of which demonstrate that CCC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need has arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content.This need has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation detection (MD) models.However, many models do not use all information available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to train the models, specifically within the South African social media environment.The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments.This research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African misinformation dataset.The model makes use of multiple sources of information for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements.It uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder.The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African misinformation dataset.Results show that using South African samples in the training of the model increases model performance, in a South African contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models.Our study suggests that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a misinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detecting human-object interactions (HOI) in a few-shot setting remains a challenge.Existing meta-learning methods struggle to extract representative features for classification due to the limited data, while existing few-shot HOI models rely on HOI text labels for classification.Moreover, some query images may display visual similarity to those outside their class, such as similar backgrounds between different HOI classes.This makes learning more challenging, especially with limited samples.Bongard-HOI (Jiang et al. 2022) epitomizes this HOI few-shot problem, making it the benchmark we focus on in this paper.In our proposed method, we introduce novel label-uncertain query augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the query inputs, aiming to distinguish the positive HOI class from the negative ones.As these augmented inputs may or may not have the same class label as the original inputs, their class label is unknown.Those belonging to a different class become hard samples due to their visual similarity to the original ones.Additionally, we introduce a novel pseudo-label generation technique that enables a mean teacher model to learn from the augmented label-uncertain inputs.We propose to augment the negative support set for the student model to enrich the semantic information, fostering diversity that challenges and enhances the student's learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by achieving 68.74% accuracy on the Bongard-HOI benchmark, a significant improvement over the existing SOTA of 66.59%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>In our evaluation on HICO-FS, a more general few-shot recognition dataset, our method achieves 73.27% accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA of 71.20% in the 5-way 5-shot task.</p>

                  <p>Although image captioning models have made significant advancements in recent years, the majority of them heavily depend on high-quality datasets containing paired images and texts which are costly to acquire.Previous works leverage the CLIP's cross-modal association ability for image captioning, relying solely on textual information under unsupervised settings.However, not only does a modality gap exist between CLIP text and image features, but a discrepancy also arises between training and inference due to the unavailability of real-world images, which hinders the cross-modal alignment in text-only captioning.This paper proposes a novel method to address these issues by incorporating synthetic image-text pairs.A pre-trained text-to-image model is deployed to obtain images that correspond to textual data, and the pseudo features of generated images are optimized toward the real ones in the CLIP embedding space.Furthermore, textual information is gathered to represent image features, resulting in the image features with various semantics and the bridged modality gap.To unify training and inference, synthetic image features would serve as the training prefix for the language decoder, while real images are used for inference.Additionally, salient objects in images are detected as assistance to enhance the learning of modality alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pretrained foundation models offer substantial benefits for a wide range of downstream tasks, which can be one of the most potential techniques to access artificial general intelligence.However, scaling up foundation transformers for maximal task-agnostic knowledge has brought about computational challenges, especially on resource-limited devices such as mobiles.This work proposes the first Binary Pretrained Foundation Transformer (BiPFT) for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, which remarkably saves 56 times operations and 28 times memory.In contrast to previous task-specific binary transformers, BiPFT exhibits a substantial enhancement in the learning capabilities of binary neural networks (BNNs), promoting BNNs into the era of pre-training.Benefiting from extensive pretraining data, we further propose a data-driven binarization method.Specifically, we first analyze the binarization error in self-attention operations and derive the polynomials of binarization error.To simulate full-precision self-attention, we define binarization error as binarization residual polynomials, and then introduce low-rank estimators to model these polynomials.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BiPFTs, surpassing task-specific baseline by 15.4% average performance on the GLUE benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>BiPFT also demonstrates improved robustness to hyperparameter changes, improved optimization efficiency, and reduced reliance on downstream distillation, which consequently generalize on various NLU tasks and simplify the downstream pipeline of BNNs.Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Xingrun-Xing/BiPFT.</p>

                  <p>We present a method named iComMa to address the 6D pose estimation problem in computer vision.The conventional pose estimation methods typically rely on the target's CAD model or necessitate specific network training tailored to particular object classes.Some existing methods address mesh-free 6D pose estimation by employing the inversion of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), aiming to overcome the aforementioned constraints.However, it still suffers from adverse initializations.By contrast, we model the pose estimation as the problem of inverting the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both the comparing and matching loss.In detail, a render-and-compare strategy is adopted for the precise estimation of poses.Additionally, a matching module is designed to enhance the model's robustness against adverse initializations by minimizing the distances between 2D keypoints.This framework systematically incorporates the distinctive characteristics and inherent rationale of render-and-compare and matching-based approaches.This comprehensive consideration equips the framework to effectively address a broader range of intricate and challenging scenarios, including instances with substantial angular deviations, all while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the superior precision and robustness of our proposed jointly optimized framework when evaluated on synthetic and complex real-world data in challenging scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep graph convolution networks (GCNs) have recently shown excellent performance in traffic prediction tasks.However, they face some challenges.First, few existing models consider the influence of auxiliary information, i.e., weather and holidays, which may result in a poor grasp of spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data.Second, both the construction of a dynamic adjacent matrix and regular graph convolution operations have quadratic computation complexity, which restricts the scalability of GCN-based models.To address such challenges, this work proposes a deep encoder-decoder model entitled AIMSAN.It contains an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and sparse cross attention-based graph convolution network (SAN).The former learns multi-attribute auxiliary information and obtains its embedded presentation of different time-window sizes.The latter uses a cross-attention mechanism to construct dynamic adjacent matrices by fusing traffic data and embedded auxiliary data.Then, SAN applies diffusion GCN on traffic data to mine rich spatial-temporal dynamics.Furthermore, AIMSAN considers and uses the spatial sparseness of traffic nodes to reduce the quadratic computation complexity.Experimental results on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other counterparts in terms of various performance indices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the proposed method has competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms but saves 35.74% of GPU memory usage, 42.25% of training time, and 45.51% of validation time on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>Issue resolution and bug-fixing processes are essential in the development of machine-learning libraries, similar to software development, to ensure well-optimized functions.Understanding the issue resolution and bug-fixing process of machine-learning libraries can help developers identify areas for improvement and optimize their strategies for issue resolution and bug-fixing.However, detailed studies on this topic are lacking.Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of issue resolution for bug-fixing processes in six machine-learning libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, Pytorch, Caffe, and Scikit-learn.We addressed seven research questions (RQs) using 16,921 issues extracted from the GitHub repository via the GitHub Rest API.We employed several quantitative methods of data analysis, including correlation, OLS regression, percentage and frequency count, and heatmap to analyze the RQs.We found the following through our empirical investigation: (1) The most common categories of issues that arise in machine-learning libraries are bugs, documentation, optimization, crashes, enhancement, new feature requests, build/CI, support, and performance.(2) Effective strategies for addressing these problems include fixing critical bugs, optimizing performance, and improving documentation.(3) These categorized issues are related to testing and runtime and are common among all six machine-learning libraries.(4) Monitoring the total number of comments on issues can provide insights into the duration of the issues.(5) It is crucial to strike a balance between prioritizing critical issues and addressing other issues in a timely manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, this study concludes that efficient issue-tracking processes, effective communication, and collaboration are vital for effective resolution of issues and bug fixing processes in machine-learning libraries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>The worldwide collaborative effort for the creation of software is technically and socially demanding.The more engaged developers are, the more value they impart to the software they create.Engaged developers, such as Margaret Hamilton programming Apollo 11, can succeed in tackling the most difficult engineering tasks.In this paper, we dive deep into an original vector of engagement - humor - and study how it fuels developer engagement.First, we collect qualitative and quantitative data about the humorous elements present within three significant, real-world software projects: faker, which helps developers introduce humor within their tests; lolcommits, which captures a photograph after each contribution made by a developer; and volkswagen, an exercise in satire, which accidentally led to the invention of an impactful software tool.Second, through a developer survey, we receive unique insights from 125 developers, who share their real-life experiences with humor in software.Our analysis of the three case studies highlights the prevalence of humor in software, and unveils the worldwide community of developers who are enthusiastic about both software and humor.We also learn about the caveats of humor in software through the valuable insights shared by our survey respondents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We report clear evidence that, when practiced responsibly, humor increases developer engagement and supports them in addressing hard engineering and cognitive tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>The most actionable highlight of our work is that software tests and documentation are the best locations in code to practice humor.</p>
