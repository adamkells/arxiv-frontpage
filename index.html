                  <p>Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding.Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language.To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels.We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines.Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span></p>

                  <p>The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been widely extended recently.It is crucial to ensure accurate latitude and longitude coordinates for UAVs, especially when the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are disrupted and unreliable.Existing visual localization methods achieve autonomous visual localization without error accumulation by matching the ground-down view image of UAV with the ortho satellite maps.However, collecting UAV ground-down view images across diverse locations is costly, leading to a scarcity of large-scale datasets for real-world scenarios.Existing datasets for UAV visual localization are often limited to small geographic areas or are focused only on urban regions with distinct textures.To address this, we define the UAV visual localization task by determining the UAV's real position coordinates on a large-scale satellite map based on the captured ground-down view.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, UAV-VisLoc, to facilitate the UAV visual localization task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset comprises images from diverse drones across 11 locations in China, capturing a range of topographical features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset features images from fixed-wing drones and multi-terrain drones, captured at different altitudes and orientations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset includes 6,742 drone images and 11 satellite maps, with metadata such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and capture date. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.963</span></span>Our dataset is tailored to support both the training and testing of models by providing a diverse and extensive data.</p>

                  <p>Scientist learn early on how to cite scientific sources to support their claims.Sometimes, however, scientists have challenges determining where a citation should be situated -- or, even worse, fail to cite a source altogether.Automatically detecting sentences that need a citation (i.e., citation worthiness) could solve both of these issues, leading to more robust and well-constructed scientific arguments.Previous researchers have applied machine learning to this task but have used small datasets and models that do not take advantage of recent algorithmic developments such as attention mechanisms in deep learning.We hypothesize that we can develop significantly accurate deep learning architectures that learn from large supervised datasets constructed from open access publications.In this work, we propose a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention mechanism and contextual information to detect sentences that need citations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also produce a new, large dataset (PMOA-CITE) based on PubMed Open Access Subset, which is orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>Our experiments show that our architecture achieves state of the art performance on the standard ACL-ARC dataset ($F_{1}=0.507$) and exhibits high performance ($F_{1}=0.856$) on the new PMOA-CITE.Moreover, we show that it can transfer learning across these datasets.We further use interpretable models to illuminate how specific language is used to promote and inhibit citations.We discover that sections and surrounding sentences are crucial for our improved predictions.We further examined purported mispredictions of the model, and uncovered systematic human mistakes in citation behavior and source data.This opens the door for our model to check documents during pre-submission and pre-archival procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make this new dataset, the code, and a web-based tool available to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.964</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the development of deep neural network generative models in recent years, significant progress has been made in the research of depth estimation in lane scenes.However, current research achievements are mainly focused on clear daytime scenarios.In complex rainy environments, the influence of rain streaks and local fog effects often leads to erroneous increases in the overall depth estimation values in images.Moreover, these natural factors can introduce disturbances to the accurate prediction of depth boundaries in images.In this paper, we investigate lane depth estimation in complex rainy environments.Based on the concept of convolutional kernel prediction, we propose a dual-layer pixel-wise convolutional kernel prediction network trained on offline data.By predicting two sets of independent convolutional kernels for the target image, we restore the depth information loss caused by complex environmental factors and address the issue of rain streak artifacts generated by a single convolutional kernel set.Furthermore, considering the lack of real rainy lane data currently available, we introduce an image synthesis algorithm, RCFLane, which comprehensively considers the darkening of the environment due to rainfall and local fog effects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We create a synthetic dataset containing 820 experimental images, which we refer to as RainKITTI, on the commonly used depth estimation dataset KITTI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.921</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed depth estimation framework achieves favorable results in highly complex lane rainy environments.</p>

                  <p>Classifying public tenders is a useful task for both companies that are invited to participate and for inspecting fraudulent activities.To facilitate the task for both participants and public administrations, the European Union presented a common taxonomy (\textit{Common Procurement Vocabulary}, CPV) which is mandatory for tenders of certain importance; however, the contracts in which a CPV label is mandatory are the minority compared to all the Public Administrations activities.Classifying over a real-world taxonomy introduces some difficulties that can not be ignored.First of all, some fine-grained classes have an insufficient (if any) number of observations in the training set, while other classes are far more frequent (even thousands of times) than the average.To overcome those difficulties, we present a zero-shot approach, based on a pre-trained language model that relies only on label description and respects the label taxonomy.To train our proposed model, we used industrial data, which comes from \url{contrattipubblici.org}, a service by \href{https://spaziodati.eu}{SpazioDati s.r.l}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>that collects public contracts stipulated in Italy in the last 25 years. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Results show that the proposed model achieves better performance in classifying low-frequent classes compared to three different baselines, and is also able to predict never-seen classes.</p>

                  <p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation.SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions.The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications.Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods.This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor.A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images.Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR.We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores various socioeconomic factors that contribute to individual financial success using machine learning algorithms and approaches.   Financial success, a critical aspect of all individual's well-being, is a complex concept influenced by a plethora of different factors.This study aims to understand the true determinants of financial success.It examines the survey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics[1], consisting of a sample of 8,984 individuals's longitudinal data over years.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises income variables and a large set of socioeconomic variables of individuals.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>An in-depth analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in financial success research, highlights the potential of leveraging longitudinal data to enhance prediction accuracy, and provides valuable insights into how various socioeconomic factors influence financial success.   The findings underscore the significant influence of highest education degree, occupation and gender as the top three determinants of individual income among socioeconomic factors examined.Yearly working hours, age and work tenure emerge as three secondary influencing factors, and all other factors including parental household income, industry, parents' highest grade and others are identified as tertiary factors.   These insights allow researchers to better understand the complex nature of financial success and enable policymakers to grasp the underlying dynamics shaping aspirations, decision-making, and the broader socio-economic fabric of society.This comprehension is crucial for fostering financial success among individuals and advancing broader societal well-being.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate.Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set.Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30.Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set.In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias.Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets.Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.</p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting.Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners.However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons.First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency.Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited.In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions.To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes.Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes.Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP.By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance.Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent approach for collaborative training of machine learning models across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.However, the quest to balance acceleration and stability becomes a significant challenge in FL, especially on the client-side.In this paper, we introduce FedCAda, an innovative federated client adaptive algorithm designed to tackle this challenge.FedCAda leverages the Adam algorithm to adjust the correction process of the first moment estimate $m$ and the second moment estimate $v$ on the client-side and aggregate adaptive algorithm parameters on the server-side, aiming to accelerate convergence speed and communication efficiency while ensuring stability and performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we investigate several algorithms incorporating different adjustment functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>This comparative analysis revealed that due to the limited information contained within client models from other clients during the initial stages of federated learning, more substantial constraints need to be imposed on the parameters of the adaptive algorithm.As federated learning progresses and clients gather more global information, FedCAda gradually diminishes the impact on adaptive parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insights for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of algorithmic improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Through extensive experiments on computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) datasets, we demonstrate that FedCAda outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, convergence, stability, and overall performance.This work contributes to adaptive algorithms for federated learning, encouraging further exploration.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning (CL) aims to extend deep models from static and enclosed environments to dynamic and complex scenarios, enabling systems to continuously acquire new knowledge of novel categories without forgetting previously learned knowledge.Recent CL models have gradually shifted towards the utilization of pre-trained models (PTMs) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies.However, continual fine-tuning still presents a serious challenge of catastrophic forgetting due to the absence of previous task data.Additionally, the fine-tune-then-frozen mechanism suffers from performance limitations due to feature channels suppression and insufficient training data in the first CL task.To this end, this paper proposes feature transformation tuning (FeTT) model to non-parametrically fine-tune backbone features across all tasks, which not only operates independently of CL training data but also smooths feature channels to prevent excessive suppression.Then, the extended ensemble strategy incorporating different PTMs with FeTT model facilitates further performance improvement.We further elaborate on the discussions of the fine-tune-then-frozen paradigm and the FeTT model from the perspectives of discrepancy in class marginal distributions and feature channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on CL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.933</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Transformers (GTs) such as SAN and GPS are graph processing models that combine Message-Passing GNNs (MPGNNs) with global Self-Attention.They were shown to be universal function approximators, with two reservations:1.The initial node features must be augmented with certain positional encodings.2.The approximation is non-uniform: Graphs of different sizes may require a different approximating network.   We first clarify that this form of universality is not unique to GTs: Using the same positional encodings, also pure MPGNNs and even 2-layer MLPs are non-uniform universal approximators.We then consider uniform expressivity: The target function is to be approximated by a single network for graphs of all sizes.There, we compare GTs to the more efficient MPGNN + Virtual Node architecture.The essential difference between the two model definitions is in their global computation method -- Self-Attention Vs Virtual Node.We prove that none of the models is a uniform-universal approximator, before proving our main result: Neither model's uniform expressivity subsumes the other's.We demonstrate the theory with experiments on synthetic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further augment our study with real-world datasets, observing mixed results which indicate no clear ranking in practice as well. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>A fundamental building block in any graph algorithm is a graph container - a data structure used to represent the graph.Ideally, a graph container enables efficient access to the underlying graph, has low space usage, and supports updating the graph efficiently.In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of graph containers designed to support running algorithms on large graphs.To our knowledge, this is the first apples-to-apples comparison of graph containers rather than overall systems, which include confounding factors such as differences in algorithm implementations and infrastructure.   We measure the running time of 10 highly-optimized algorithms across over 20 different containers and 10 graphs.Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the average algorithm running time does not differ much across containers, especially those that support dynamic updates.Specifically, a simple container based on an off-the-shelf B-tree is only 1.22x slower on average than a highly optimized static one.Moreover, we observe that simplifying a graph-container Application Programming Interface (API) to only a few simple functions incurs a mere 1.16x slowdown compared to a complete API.Finally, we also measure batch-insert throughput in dynamic-graph containers for a full picture of their performance.   To perform the benchmarks, we introduce BYO, a unified framework that standardizes evaluations of graph-algorithm performance across different graph containers.BYO extends the Graph Based Benchmark Suite (Dhulipala et al. 18), a state-of-the-art graph algorithm benchmark, to easily plug into different dynamic graph containers and enable fair comparisons between them on a large suite of graph algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While several graph algorithm benchmarks have been developed to date, to the best of our knowledge, BYO is the first system designed to benchmark graph containers <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) is a latent variable modeling technique commonly used to identify smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories underlying high-dimensional neural recordings.Specifically, researchers model spiking rates as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference.Recently, GPFA has been extended to model spike count data.However, due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood, the inference becomes intractable.Prior works rely on either black-box inference techniques, numerical integration or polynomial approximations of the likelihood to handle intractability.To overcome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate Gaussian process factor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally tractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data.In particular, we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the model conditionally conjugate.Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of simple closed-form updates using a variational EM algorithm.Furthermore, due to its conditional conjugacy, we show our model can be readily scaled using sparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated inference via natural gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our method, we empirically demonstrate its efficacy through experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper investigates an extremely challenging problem, barely-supervised medical image segmentation (BSS), where the training dataset comprises limited labeled data with only single-slice annotations and numerous unlabeled images.Currently, state-of-the-art (SOTA) BSS methods utilize a registration-based paradigm, depending on image registration to propagate single-slice annotations into volumetric pseudo labels for constructing a complete labeled set.However, this paradigm has a critical limitation: the pseudo labels generated by image registration are unreliable and noisy.Motivated by this, we propose a new perspective: training a model using only single-annotated slices as the labeled set without relying on image registration.To this end, we formulate BSS as an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem.Specifically, we first design a novel noise-free labeled data construction algorithm (NFC) for slice-to-volume labeled data synthesis, which may result in a side effect: domain shifts between the synthesized images and the original images.Then, a frequency and spatial mix-up strategy (FSX) is further introduced to mitigate the domain shifts for UDA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides a promising alternative for BSS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Remarkably, the proposed method with only one labeled slice achieves an 80.77% dice score on left atrial segmentation, outperforming the SOTA by 61.28%.The code will be released upon the publication of this paper.</p>

                  <p>Large language models are well-known to be effective at few-shot in-context learning (ICL).Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have enabled unprecedentedly long context windows, presenting an opportunity to explore their capability to perform ICL with many more demonstrating examples.In this work, we evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models scaling from few-shot to many-shot ICL.We benchmark GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro across 10 datasets spanning multiple domains (natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery) and tasks (multi-class, multi-label, and fine-grained classification).We observe that many-shot ICL, including up to almost 2,000 multimodal demonstrating examples, leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples)ICL across all of the datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, Gemini 1.5 Pro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of tested examples on many datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Given the high inference costs associated with the long prompts required for many-shot ICL, we also explore the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call.We show that batching up to 50 queries can lead to performance improvements under zero-shot and many-shot ICL, with substantial gains in the zero-shot setting on multiple datasets, while drastically reducing per-query cost and latency.Finally, we measure ICL data efficiency of the models, or the rate at which the models learn from more demonstrating examples.We find that while GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieve similar zero-shot performance across the datasets, Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets.Our results suggest that many-shot ICL could enable users to efficiently adapt multimodal foundation models to new applications and domains.Our codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/ManyICL .</p>

                  <p>3D face registration is an important process in which a 3D face model is aligned and mapped to a template face.However, the task of 3D face registration becomes particularly challenging when dealing with partial face data, where only limited facial information is available.To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach that combines quasi-conformal geometry with deep neural networks for partial face registration.The proposed framework begins with a Landmark Detection Network that utilizes curvature information to detect the presence of facial features and estimate their corresponding coordinates.These facial landmark features serve as essential guidance for the registration process.To establish a dense correspondence between the partial face and the template surface, a registration network based on quasiconformal theories is employed.The registration network establishes a bijective quasiconformal surface mapping aligning corresponding partial faces based on detected landmarks and curvature values.It consists of the Coefficients Prediction Network, which outputs the optimal Beltrami coefficient representing the surface mapping.The Beltrami coefficient quantifies the local geometric distortion of the mapping.By controlling the magnitude of the Beltrami coefficient through a suitable activation function, the bijectivity and geometric distortion of the mapping can be controlled.The Beltrami coefficient is then fed into the Beltrami solver network to reconstruct the corresponding mapping.The surface registration enables the acquisition of corresponding regions and the establishment of point-wise correspondence between different partial faces, facilitating precise shape comparison through the evaluation of point-wise geometric differences at these corresponding regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image-guided depth completion aims at generating a dense depth map from sparse LiDAR data and RGB image.Recent methods have shown promising performance by reformulating it as a classification problem with two sub-tasks: depth discretization and probability prediction.They divide the depth range into several discrete depth values as depth categories, serving as priors for scene depth distributions.However, previous depth discretization methods are easy to be impacted by depth distribution variations across different scenes, resulting in suboptimal scene depth distribution priors.To address the above problem, we propose a progressive depth decoupling and modulating network, which incrementally decouples the depth range into bins and adaptively generates multi-scale dense depth maps in multiple stages.Specifically, we first design a Bins Initializing Module (BIM) to construct the seed bins by exploring the depth distribution information within a sparse depth map, adapting variations of depth distribution.Then, we devise an incremental depth decoupling branch to progressively refine the depth distribution information from global to local.Meanwhile, an adaptive depth modulating branch is developed to progressively improve the probability representation from coarse-grained to fine-grained.And the bi-directional information interactions are proposed to strengthen the information interaction between those two branches (sub-tasks) for promoting information complementation in each branch.Further, we introduce a multi-scale supervision mechanism to learn the depth distribution information in latent features and enhance the adaptation capability across different scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>The code will be open-sourced at [this https URL](https://github.com/Cisse-away/PDDM).</p>

                  <p>We develop a theory of neural synaptic balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks.For a given additive cost function $R$ (regularizer), a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights.The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training.The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions.The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions.The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ ($p>0$) regularizers.The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions.The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative.Finally, and most importantly, given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights.The reason for this convergence is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The theory is corroborated through various simulations carried out on benchmark data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Scaling and balancing operations are entirely local and thus physically plausible in biological and neuromorphic networks.</p>

                  <p>Many real-world interconnections among entities can be characterized as graphs.Collecting local graph information with balanced privacy and data utility has garnered notable interest recently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper delves into the problem of identifying and protecting critical information of entity connections for individual participants in a graph based on cohesive subgraph searches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>This problem has not been addressed in the literature.To address the problem, we propose to extract the critical connections of a queried vertex using a fortress-like cohesive subgraph model known as $p$-cohesion.A user's connections within a fortress are obfuscated when being released, to protect critical information about the user.Novel merit and penalty score functions are designed to measure each participant's critical connections in the minimal $p$-cohesion, facilitating effective identification of the connections.We further propose to preserve the privacy of a vertex enquired by only protecting its critical connections when responding to queries raised by data collectors.We prove that, under the decentralized differential privacy (DDP) mechanism, one's response satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DDP when its critical connections are protected while the rest remains unperturbed.The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-life graph datasets.</p>

                  <p>This article explores the evaluation method for the language communication proficiency of AI-driven robots engaging in interactive communication with children.The utilization of AI-driven robots in children's everyday communication is swiftly advancing, underscoring the importance of evaluating these robots'language communication skills.Based on 11 Chinese families' interviews and thematic analysis of the comment text from shopping websites, a framework is introduced in the article to assess five key dimensions of child-robot language communication: interactivity, specificity, development, sociality, and safety.We draw on the concept of "children's agency", viewing children as active participants in shaping society and cultural life alongside adults.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, this article places particular emphasis on collecting data related to children. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>Whether through survey interviews or direct interactive experiments, we treat children as an independent object for data collection.The study involved empirical research following the mentioned framework, which involved capturing interaction videos in natural conversation settings among children from 6 families.Analysis was performed on quantitative data obtained from video recordings, alongside questionnaires and interviews carried out by parents acting as participants or observers.We found that the presence or absence of parents during children's interactions with robots can impact the evaluation of robots'language communication abilities.Ultimately, this article proposes an enhanced comprehensive evaluation framework incorporating insights from parents and children, supported by empirical evidence and inter-rater consistency assessments, showcasing the scheme's efficacy.</p>

                  <p>The IoT and Business Process Management (BPM) communities co-exist in many shared application domains, such as manufacturing and healthcare.The IoT community has a strong focus on hardware, connectivity and data; the BPM community focuses mainly on finding, controlling, and enhancing the structured interactions among the IoT devices in processes.While the field of Process Mining deals with the extraction of process models and process analytics from process event logs, the data produced by IoT sensors often is at a lower granularity than these process-level events.The fundamental questions about extracting and abstracting process-related data from streams of IoT sensor values are: (1) Which sensor values can be clustered together as part of process events?, (2) Which sensor values signify the start and end of such events?, (3) Which sensor values are related but not essential?This work proposes a framework to semi-automatically perform a set of structured steps to convert low-level IoT sensor data into higher-level process events that are suitable for process mining.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework is meant to provide a generic sequence of abstract steps to guide the event extraction, abstraction, and correlation, with variation points for plugging in specific analysis techniques and algorithms for each step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>To assess the completeness of the framework, we present a set of challenges, how they can be tackled through the framework, and an example on how to instantiate the framework in a real-world demonstration from the field of smart manufacturing.Based on this framework, future research can be conducted in a structured manner through refining and improving individual steps.</p>

                  <p>It seems that in the current age, computers, computation, and data have an increasingly important role to play in scientific research and discovery.This is reflected in part by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have become great areas of interest not just for computer science but also for many other fields of study.More generally, there have been trends moving towards the use of bigger, more complex and higher capacity models.It also seems that stochastic models, and stochastic variants of existing deterministic models, have become important research directions in various fields.For all of these types of models, gradient-based optimization remains as the dominant paradigm for model fitting, control, and more.This dissertation considers unconstrained, nonlinear optimization problems, with a focus on the gradient itself, that key quantity which enables the solution of such problems.   In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of reverse differentiation, a term which describes the body of techniques which enables the efficient computation of gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We cover relevant techniques both in the deterministic and stochastic cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We present a new framework for calculating the gradient of problems which involve both deterministic and stochastic elements.In chapter 2, we analyze the properties of the gradient estimator, with a focus on those properties which are typically assumed in convergence proofs of optimization algorithms.Chapter 3 gives various examples of applying our new gradient estimator.We further explore the idea of working with piecewise continuous models, that is, models with distinct branches and if statements which define what specific branch to use.</p>

Next, we show how to construct (i) a secret sharing scheme with no-signaling certified deletion for any monotone access structure, and (ii) a threshold secret sharing scheme with adaptive certified deletion.Our first construction uses Bartusek and Khurana's (CRYPTO 2023) 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme with certified deletion as a building block, while our second construction is built from scratch and requires several new technical ideas.For example, we significantly generalize the ``XOR extractor'' of Agarwal, Bartusek, Khurana, and Kumar (EUROCRYPT 2023) in order to obtain high rate seedless extraction from certain quantum sources of entropy.</p>

                  <p>Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima.To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis.Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data.We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network.Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework.Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness.Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.</p>

                  <p>Facing the current debate on whether Large Language Models (LLMs) attain near-human intelligence levels (Mitchell & Krakauer, 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023; Kosinski, 2023; Shiffrin & Mitchell, 2023; Ullman, 2023), the current study introduces a benchmark for evaluating social intelligence, one of the most distinctive aspects of human cognition.We developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for social dynamics and introduced two evaluation tasks: Inverse Reasoning (IR) and Inverse Inverse Planning (IIP).Our approach also encompassed a computational model based on recursive Bayesian inference, adept at elucidating diverse human behavioral patterns.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses revealed that humans surpassed the latest GPT models in overall performance, zero-shot learning, one-shot generalization, and adaptability to multi-modalities.Notably, GPT models demonstrated social intelligence only at the most basic order (order = 0), in stark contrast to human social intelligence (order >= 2).Further examination indicated a propensity of LLMs to rely on pattern recognition for shortcuts, casting doubt on their possession of authentic human-level social intelligence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our codes, dataset, appendix and human data are released at https://github.com/bigai-ai/Evaluate-n-Model-Social-Intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.586</span></span></p>

In this study, we explore optimization games, in which the value of the characteristic function is provided as the optimal value of an optimization problem.To assess the robustness of the allocation methods, we use the Lipschitz constant, which quantifies the extent of change in the allocation vector in response to a unit perturbation in the weight vector of the underlying problem.Thereafter, we provide an algorithm for the matching game that returns an allocation belonging to the $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon\right)$-approximate core with Lipschitz constant $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Additionally, we provide an algorithm for a minimum spanning tree game that returns an allocation belonging to the $4$-approximate core with a constant Lipschitz constant.   The Shapley value is a popular allocation that satisfies several desirable properties.Therefore, we investigate the robustness of the Shapley value.We demonstrate that the Lipschitz constant of the Shapley value for the minimum spanning tree is constant, whereas that for the matching game is $\Omega(\log n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices.</p>
