                  <p>As a neuromorphic sensor with high temporal resolution, spike cameras offer notable advantages over traditional cameras in high-speed vision applications such as high-speed optical estimation, depth estimation, and object tracking.Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes.Instead of the multi-view images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time.To reconstruct a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function.We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes generated by blender with the spike camera simulator.Our results demonstrate that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span></p>

                  <p>The continual expansion of software size and complexity has led to an increased focus on reducing defects and bugs during development.Although Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) offer help, in practice, the significant number of false positives can impede developers' productivity and confidence in the tools.Therefore, previous research efforts have explored learning-based methods to validate the reported warnings.Nevertheless, there are still some limitations.(1) The granularity of prior research is coarse, as it focuses on identifying either actionable warnings throughout extensive development histories or potential true warnings at the function level.These approaches lack specificity regarding individual bugs and warnings.(2) Machine learning-based approaches need much manual effort for feature engineering while existing deep learning-based approaches ignore key semantics between source code and warnings.(3) The small number of selected projects hinders the comprehensive evaluation of these approaches.In this paper, we proposed a fine-grained warning verification approach that is sensitive to bugs for improving the results of ASATs, namely \ourtool.Specifically, we design a novel LSTM-based model that captures both fine-grained semantics of source code and warnings from ASATs and highlights their correlations with cross-attention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle the data scarcity of training and evaluation, we collected a large-scale dataset of 280,273 warnings, namely FineWA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>It is ten times larger than the existing largest dataset.Then, we conducted extensive experiments on the dataset to evaluate FineWAVE.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with an F1-score of 97.79% for reducing false alarms and 67.06% for confirming actual warnings, which also significantly outperforms all baselines.</p>

                  <p>In recent research, contrastive learning has proven to be a highly effective method for representation learning and is widely used for dense retrieval.However, we identify that relying solely on contrastive learning can lead to suboptimal retrieval performance.On the other hand, despite many retrieval datasets supporting various learning objectives beyond contrastive learning, combining them efficiently in multi-task learning scenarios can be challenging.In this paper, we introduce M3, an advanced recursive Multi-hop dense sentence retrieval system built upon a novel Multi-task Mixed-objective approach for dense text representation learning, addressing the aforementioned challenges.Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale open-domain fact verification benchmark dataset, FEVER.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/TonyBY/M3 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Remote sensing through unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been increasing in forestry in recent years, along with using machine learning for data processing.Deep learning architectures, extensively applied in natural language and image processing, have recently been extended to the point cloud domain.However, the availability of point cloud datasets for training and testing remains limited.Creating forested environment point cloud datasets is expensive, requires high-precision sensors, and is time-consuming as manual point classification is required.Moreover, forest areas could be inaccessible or dangerous for humans, further complicating data collection.Then, a question arises whether it is possible to use synthetic data to train deep learning networks without the need to rely on large volumes of real forest data.To answer this question, we developed a realistic simulator that procedurally generates synthetic forest scenes.Thanks to this, we have conducted a comparative study of different state-of-the-art point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation.Using created datasets, we determined the feasibility of using synthetic data to train deep learning networks to classify point clouds from real forest datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the simulator and the datasets are released as part of this work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.841</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the emergence of vision language models in the medical imaging domain, numerous studies have focused on two dominant research activities: (1) report generation from Chest X-rays (CXR), and (2) synthetic scan generation from text or reports.Despite some research incorporating multi-view CXRs into the generative process, prior patient scans and reports have been generally disregarded.This can inadvertently lead to the leaving out of important medical information, thus affecting generation quality.To address this, we propose TiBiX: Leveraging Temporal information for Bidirectional X-ray and Report Generation.Considering previous scans, our approach facilitates bidirectional generation, primarily addressing two challenging problems: (1) generating the current image from the previous image and current report and (2) generating the current report based on both the previous and current images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we extract and release a curated temporal benchmark dataset derived from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, which focuses on temporal data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Our comprehensive experiments and ablation studies explore the merits of incorporating prior CXRs and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the report generation task.Furthermore, we attain on-par performance with SOTA image generation efforts, thus serving as a new baseline in longitudinal bidirectional CXR-to-report generation.The code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/TiBiX.</p>

                  <p>Currently, text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) can embed hidden features to texts generated by LLMs to facilitate subsequent detection, thus alleviating the problem of misuse of LLMs.Although the current text watermarking algorithms perform well in most high-entropy scenarios, its performance in low-entropy scenarios still needs to be improved.In this work, we proposed that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in the watermark detection process, that is, the weight of each token should be adjusted according to its entropy during watermark detection, rather than setting the weight of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods.Specifically, we proposed an Entropy-based Watermark Detection (EWD) that gives higher-entropy tokens higher weights during watermark detection, so as to better reflect the degree of watermarking.Furthermore, the proposed detection process is training-free and fully automated.%In actual detection, we use a proxy-LLM to calculate the entropy of each token, without the need to use the original LLM.In the experiment, we found that our method can achieve better detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

Objectives:The aim of this study is to evaluate the Mann-Whitney U test on DP-synthetic biomedical data in terms of Type I and Type II errors, in order to establish whether statistical hypothesis testing performed on privacy preserving synthetic data is likely to lead to loss of test's validity or decreased power.   Methods: We evaluate the Mann-Whitney U test on DP-synthetic data generated from real-world data, including a prostate cancer dataset (n=500) and a cardiovascular dataset (n=70 000), as well as on data drawn from two Gaussian distributions.Five different DP-synthetic data generation methods are evaluated, including two basic DP histogram release methods and MWEM, Private-PGM, and DP GAN algorithms.   Conclusion: Most of the tested DP-synthetic data generation methods showed inflated Type I error, especially at privacy budget levels of $\epsilon\leq 1$.This result calls for caution when releasing and analyzing DP-synthetic data: low p-values may be obtained in statistical tests simply as a byproduct of the noise added to protect privacy.A DP smoothed histogram-based synthetic data generation method was shown to produce valid Type I error for all privacy levels tested but required a large original dataset size and a modest privacy budget ($\epsilon\geq 5$) in order to have reasonable Type II error levels.</p>

                  <p>Bounding boxes uniquely characterize object detection, where a good detector gives accurate bounding boxes of categories of interest.However, in the real-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find out whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the detector generalization ability.In this work, we find under feature map dropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not change much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable position changes.We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect this stability.Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of bounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout.To obtain BoS score, we use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets and compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test set.We contribute to finding that BoS score has a strong, positive correlation with detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various test environments.This relationship allows us to predict the accuracy of detectors on various real-world test sets without accessing test ground truths, verified on canonical detection tasks such as vehicle detection and pedestrian detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/YangYangGirl/BoS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset.We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>

                  <p>Although mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) algorithms perform well in academic datasets, their performance is limited in practical application due to the ideal experimental setting of clean training data.Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom discussed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper considers label-level noise in image sensory anomaly detection for the first time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To solve this problem, we proposed a memory-based unsupervised AD method, SoftPatch, which efficiently denoises the data at the patch level.Noise discriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset construction.The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary.Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset.Comprehensive experiments in various noise scenes demonstrate that SoftPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art AD methods on the MVTecAD and BTAD benchmarks and is comparable to those methods under the setting without noise.</p>

                  <p>Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in learning semantic category discrimination.Despite the remarkable performance of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to the well-annotated data.However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the multimodal scenario.In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges -- enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and \emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval.First, we propose a semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend different modalities and provide precise transport cost.Second, to narrow the discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching.Both of these two components leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate effective cost function.The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) heavily depends on label quality for its performance.However, the label distribution among individual clients is always both noisy and heterogeneous.The high loss incurred by client-specific samples in heterogeneous label noise poses challenges for distinguishing between client-specific and noisy label samples, impacting the effectiveness of existing label noise learning approaches.To tackle this issue, we propose FedFixer, where the personalized model is introduced to cooperate with the global model to effectively select clean client-specific samples.In the dual models, updating the personalized model solely at a local level can lead to overfitting on noisy data due to limited samples, consequently affecting both the local and global models' performance.To mitigate overfitting, we address this concern from two perspectives.Firstly, we employ a confidence regularizer to alleviate the impact of unconfident predictions caused by label noise.Secondly, a distance regularizer is implemented to constrain the disparity between the personalized and global models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness of FedFixer through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>The results demonstrate that FedFixer can perform well in filtering noisy label samples on different clients, especially in highly heterogeneous label noise scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Graph augmentation with contrastive learning has gained significant attention in the field of recommendation systems due to its ability to learn expressive user representations, even when labeled data is limited.However, directly applying existing GCL models to real-world recommendation environments poses challenges.There are two primary issues to address.Firstly, the lack of consideration for data noise in contrastive learning can result in noisy self-supervised signals, leading to degraded performance.Secondly, many existing GCL approaches rely on graph neural network (GNN) architectures, which can suffer from over-smoothing problems due to non-adaptive message passing.To address these challenges, we propose a principled framework called GraphAug.This framework introduces a robust data augmentor that generates denoised self-supervised signals, enhancing recommender systems.The GraphAug framework incorporates a graph information bottleneck (GIB)-regularized augmentation paradigm, which automatically distills informative self-supervision information and adaptively adjusts contrastive view generation.Through rigorous experimentation on real-world datasets, we thoroughly assessed the performance of our novel GraphAug model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The outcomes consistently unveil its superiority over existing baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>The source code for our model is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphAug.</p>

                  <p>The continual expansion of software size and complexity has led to an increased focus on reducing defects and bugs during development.Although Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) offer help, in practice, the significant number of false positives can impede developers' productivity and confidence in the tools.Therefore, previous research efforts have explored learning-based methods to validate the reported warnings.Nevertheless, there are still some limitations.(1) The granularity of prior research is coarse, as it focuses on identifying either actionable warnings throughout extensive development histories or potential true warnings at the function level.These approaches lack specificity regarding individual bugs and warnings.(2) Machine learning-based approaches need much manual effort for feature engineering while existing deep learning-based approaches ignore key semantics between source code and warnings.(3) The small number of selected projects hinders the comprehensive evaluation of these approaches.In this paper, we proposed a fine-grained warning verification approach that is sensitive to bugs for improving the results of ASATs, namely \ourtool.Specifically, we design a novel LSTM-based model that captures both fine-grained semantics of source code and warnings from ASATs and highlights their correlations with cross-attention.To tackle the data scarcity of training and evaluation, we collected a large-scale dataset of 280,273 warnings, namely FineWA.It is ten times larger than the existing largest dataset.Then, we conducted extensive experiments on the dataset to evaluate FineWAVE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with an F1-score of 97.79% for reducing false alarms and 67.06% for confirming actual warnings, which also significantly outperforms all baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Latent fingerprints are one of the most widely used forensic evidence by law enforcement agencies.However, latent recognition performance is far from the exemplary performance of sensor fingerprint recognition due to deformations and artifacts within these images.In this study, we propose a fusion based local matching approach towards latent fingerprint recognition.Recent latent recognition studies typically relied on local descriptor generation methods, in which either handcrafted minutiae features or deep neural network features are extracted around a minutia of interest, in the latent recognition process.Proposed approach would integrate these handcrafted features with a recently proposed deep neural network embedding features in a multi-stage fusion approach to significantly improve latent recognition results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown on several public and private data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As demonstrated in our experimental results, proposed method improves rank-1 identification accuracy by considerably for real-world datasets when compared to either the single usage of these features or existing state-of-the-art methods in the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span></p>

                  <p>One of the biggest challenges in single-view 3D shape reconstruction in the wild is the scarcity of <3D shape, 2D image>-paired data from real-world environments.Inspired by remarkable achievements via domain randomization, we propose ObjectDR which synthesizes such paired data via a random simulation of visual variations in object appearances and backgrounds.Our data synthesis framework exploits a conditional generative model (e.g., ControlNet) to generate images conforming to spatial conditions such as 2.5D sketches, which are obtainable through a rendering process of 3D shapes from object collections (e.g., Objaverse-XL).To simulate diverse variations while preserving object silhouettes embedded in spatial conditions, we also introduce a disentangled framework which leverages an initial object guidance.After synthesizing a wide range of data, we pre-train a model on them so that it learns to capture a domain-invariant geometry prior which is consistent across various domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate its effectiveness by substantially improving 3D shape reconstruction models on a real-world benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>In a scale-up evaluation, our pre-training achieves 23.6% superior results compared with the pre-training on high-quality computer graphics renderings.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation.Yet, incorporating LLM-based code generation into real-life software projects poses challenges, as the generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information.As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper puts forward a novel approach, termed ProCoder, which iteratively refines the project-level code context for precise code generation, guided by the compiler feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>In particular, ProCoder first leverages compiler techniques to identify a mismatch between the generated code and the project's context.It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository.We integrate ProCoder with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation.Experimental results show that ProCoder significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on project context, and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines.</p>

                  <p>Human motion prediction is consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences.It is a longstanding challenge due to motion's complex dynamics and uncertainty.Existing methods focus on building up complicated neural networks to model the motion dynamics.The predicted results are required to be strictly similar to the training samples with L2 loss in current training pipeline.However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty property which is crucial to the prediction task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that the recorded motion in training data could be an observation of possible future, rather than a predetermined result. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>In addition, existing works calculate the predicted error on each future frame equally during training, while recent work indicated that different frames could play different roles.In this work, a novel computationally efficient encoder-decoder model with uncertainty consideration is proposed, which could learn proper characteristics for future frames by a dynamic function.Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our uncertainty consideration approach has obvious advantages both in quantity and quality.Moreover, the proposed method could produce motion sequences with much better quality that avoids the intractable shaking artefacts.We believe our work could provide a novel perspective to consider the uncertainty quality for the general motion prediction task and encourage the studies in this field.The code will be available in https://github.com/Motionpre/Adaptive-Salient-Loss-SAGGB.</p>

                  <p>Traditional approaches to neuroevolution often start from scratch.This becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and data requirements when targeting modern, deep neural networks.Using a warm start could be highly advantageous, e.g., using previously trained networks, potentially from different sources.This moreover enables leveraging the benefits of transfer learning (in particular vastly reduced training effort).However, recombining trained networks is non-trivial because architectures and feature representations typically differ.Consequently, a straightforward exchange of layers tends to lead to a performance breakdown.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We overcome this by matching the layers of parent networks based on their connectivity, identifying potential crossover points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>To correct for differing feature representations between these layers we employ stitching, which merges the networks by introducing new layers at crossover points.To train the merged network, only stitching layers need to be considered.New networks can then be created by selecting a subnetwork by choosing which stitching layers to (not) use.Assessing their performance is efficient as only their evaluation on data is required.We experimentally show that our approach enables finding networks that represent novel trade-offs between performance and computational cost, with some even dominating the original networks.</p>

On the other hand, using large base objects, we give a strong possibility result in the form of a universal construction: an object with $s$ possible states can be implemented in a wait-free, history-independent manner from compare-and-swap base objects that each have $O(s + 2^n)$ possible memory states, where $n$ is the number of processes in the system.</p>

                  <p>Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing.Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data.With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities.However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset.Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation.In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space.Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency.Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns.Our implementation is available at https://github.com/WAL-l/SeisFusion.</p>

                  <p>In the development of advanced Texas Hold'em AI systems, abstraction technology has garnered widespread attention due to its significant effect in simplifying game complexity.This study adopts a more specific model, the games of ordered signal, to describe Texas Hold'em-style games and optimizes this model to streamline its mathematical representation and broaden its applicability.By transitioning from a broad imperfect information game model to a game with ordered signals model, we have separated the previously intertwined infoset abstraction and action abstraction into independent signal abstraction and action abstraction.Importantly, this signal abstraction provides a mathematical framework for the hand abstraction task, which is emphatically discussed in this paper.Additionally, a novel common refinement principle is introduced, revealing the limit performance of hand abstraction algorithms.We introduce potential outcome isomorphism (POI) and pinpoint that it suffers from the issue of excessive abstraction.Futher, We demonstrate that POI serves as a common refinement for leading outcome-based hand abstraction algorithms, such as E[HS] and PA\&PAEMD.Consequently, excessive abstraction also inherently affects these algorithms, leading to suboptimal performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our investigation reveals the omission of historical data as a primary contributor to excessive abstraction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>To remedy this, we propose the K-Recall Outcome Isomorphism (KROI) to incorporate the missing information.Compared with POI, KROI more accurately mirrors lossless isomorphism (LI), the ground truth, offering enhanced signal abstraction resolution.Experimental results in the Numeral211 Hold'em indicate that strategies developed through KROI approximate the exploitability of those developed through LI more closely than those trained through POI.</p>

                  <p>The unprecedented availability of large-scale datasets in neuroscience has spurred the exploration of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) both as empirical tools and as models of natural neural systems.Their appeal lies in their ability to approximate arbitrary functions directly from observations, circumventing the need for cumbersome mechanistic modeling.However, without appropriate constraints, DNNs risk producing implausible models, diminishing their scientific value.Moreover, the interpretability of DNNs poses a significant challenge, particularly with the adoption of more complex expressive architectures.In this perspective, we argue for universal differential equations (UDEs) as a unifying approach for model development and validation in neuroscience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>UDEs view differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable mathematical objects that can be augmented and trained with scalable deep learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This synergy facilitates the integration of decades of extensive literature in calculus, numerical analysis, and neural modeling with emerging advancements in AI into a potent framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>We provide a primer on this burgeoning topic in scientific machine learning and demonstrate how UDEs fill in a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience.We outline a flexible recipe for modeling neural systems with UDEs and discuss how they can offer principled solutions to inherent challenges across diverse neuroscience applications such as understanding neural computation, controlling neural systems, neural decoding, and normative modeling.</p>

                  <p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from both `seen' and `unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled `seen' class images.A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task.An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model.As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning).Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes.We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods.Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%.The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/sptnet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span></p>

                  <p>{\em Minimum-weight spanning tree} (MST) is one of the fundamental and well-studied problems in distributed computing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we initiate the study of constructing MST using mobile agents (aka robots). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.591</span></span>Suppose $n$ agents are positioned initially arbitrarily on the nodes of a connected, undirected, arbitrary, anonymous, port-labeled, weighted $n$-node, $m$-edge graph $G$ of diameter $D$ and maximum degree $\Delta$.The agents relocate themselves autonomously and compute an MST of $G$ such that exactly one agent positions on a node and tracks in its memory which of its adjacent edges belong to the MST.The objective is to minimize time and memory requirements.Following the literature, we consider the synchronous setting in which each agent performs its operations synchronously with others and hence time can be measured in rounds.We first establish a generic result: if $n$ and $\Delta$ are known a priori and memory per agent is as much as node memory in the message-passing model (of distributed computing), agents can simulate any $O(T)$-round deterministic algorithm for any problem in the message-passing model to the agent model in $O(\Delta T \log n+n\log^2n)$ rounds.As a corollary, MST can be constructed in the agent model in $O(\max\{\Delta \sqrt{n} \log n \log^*n, \Delta D \log n,n\log^2n\})$ rounds simulating the celebrated $O(\sqrt{n} \log^*n +D)$-round GKP algorithm for MST in the message-passing model.We then establish that, without knowing any graph parameter a priori, there exists a deterministic algorithm to construct MST in the agent model in $O(m+n\log n)$ rounds with $O(n \log n)$ bits memory at each agent.The presented algorithm needs to overcome highly non-trivial challenges on how to synchronize agents in computing MST as they may initially be positioned arbitrarily on the graph nodes.</p>

                  <p>In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing private data.In semantic segmentation, the Federated source Free Domain Adaptation (FFreeDA) setting is of particular interest, where clients undergo unsupervised training after supervised pretraining at the server side.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While few recent works address FL for autonomous vehicles, intrinsic real-world challenges such as the presence of adverse weather conditions and the existence of different autonomous agents are still unexplored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>To bridge this gap, we address both problems and introduce a new federated semantic segmentation setting where both car and drone clients co-exist and collaborate.Specifically, we propose a novel approach for this setting which exploits a batch-norm weather-aware strategy to dynamically adapt the model to the different weather conditions, while hyperbolic space prototypes are used to align the heterogeneous client representations.Finally, we introduce FLYAWARE, the first semantic segmentation dataset with adverse weather data for aerial vehicles.</p>
