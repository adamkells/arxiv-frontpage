                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have profoundly transformed natural language applications, with a growing reliance on instruction-based definitions for designing chatbots.However, post-deployment the chatbot definitions are fixed and are vulnerable to attacks by malicious users, emphasizing the need to prevent unethical applications and financial losses.Existing studies explore user prompts' impact on LLM-based chatbots, yet practical methods to contain attacks on application-specific chatbots remain unexplored.This paper presents System Prompt Meta Language (SPML), a domain-specific language for refining prompts and monitoring the inputs to the LLM-based chatbots.SPML actively checks attack prompts, ensuring user inputs align with chatbot definitions to prevent malicious execution on the LLM backbone, optimizing costs.It also streamlines chatbot definition crafting with programming language capabilities, overcoming natural language design challenges.Additionally, we introduce a groundbreaking benchmark with 1.8k system prompts and 20k user inputs, offering the inaugural language and benchmark for chatbot definition evaluation.Experiments across datasets demonstrate SPML's proficiency in understanding attacker prompts, surpassing models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and codes are publicly available at: https://prompt-compiler.github.io/SPML/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning architectures have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation.This may be attributed to the use of over-parameterized, monolithic deep learning architectures executed on large datasets.Although such architectures lead to increased accuracy, this is usually accompanied by a large increase in computation and memory requirements during inference.While this is a non-issue in traditional machine learning pipelines, the recent confluence of machine learning and fields like the Internet of Things has rendered such large architectures infeasible for execution in low-resource settings.In such settings, previous efforts have proposed decision cascades where inputs are passed through models of increasing complexity until desired performance is achieved.However, we argue that cascaded prediction leads to increased computational cost due to wasteful intermediate computations.To address this, we propose PaSeR (Parsimonious Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning) a non-cascading, cost-aware learning pipeline as an alternative to cascaded architectures.Through experimental evaluation on real-world and standard datasets, we demonstrate that PaSeR achieves better accuracy while minimizing computational cost relative to cascaded models.Further, we introduce a new metric IoU/GigaFlop to evaluate the balance between cost and performance.On the real-world task of battery material phase segmentation, PaSeR yields a minimum performance improvement of 174% on the IoU/GigaFlop metric with respect to baselines.We also demonstrate PaSeR's adaptability to complementary models trained on a noisy MNIST dataset, where it achieved a minimum performance improvement on IoU/GigaFlop of 13.4% over SOTA models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/scailab/paser . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the health domain, decisions are often based on different data modalities.Thus, when creating prediction models, multimodal fusion approaches that can extract and combine relevant features from different data modalities, can be highly beneficial.Furthermore, it is important to understand how each modality impacts the final prediction, especially in high-stake domains, so that these models can be used in a trustworthy and responsible manner.We propose MultiFIX: a new interpretability-focused multimodal data fusion pipeline that explicitly induces separate features from different data types that can subsequently be combined to make a final prediction.An end-to-end deep learning architecture is used to train a predictive model and extract representative features of each modality.Each part of the model is then explained using explainable artificial intelligence techniques.Attention maps are used to highlight important regions in image inputs.Inherently interpretable symbolic expressions, learned with GP-GOMEA, are used to describe the contribution of tabular inputs.The fusion of the extracted features to predict the target label is also replaced by a symbolic expression, learned with GP-GOMEA.Results on synthetic problems demonstrate the strengths and limitations of MultiFIX.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we apply MultiFIX to a publicly available dataset for the detection of malignant skin lesions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, many versatile Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged continuously.However, their capacity to query information depicted in visual charts and engage in reasoning based on the queried contents remains under-explored.In this paper, to comprehensively and rigorously benchmark the ability of the off-the-shelf MLLMs in the chart domain, we construct ChartX, a multi-modal evaluation set covering 18 chart types, 7 chart tasks, 22 disciplinary topics, and high-quality chart data.Besides, we develop ChartVLM to offer a new perspective on handling multi-modal tasks that strongly depend on interpretable patterns, such as reasoning tasks in the field of charts or geometric images.We evaluate the chart-related ability of mainstream MLLMs and our ChartVLM on the proposed ChartX evaluation set.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChartVLM surpasses both versatile and chart-related large models, achieving results comparable to GPT-4V. We believe that our study can pave the way for further exploration in creating a more comprehensive chart evaluation set and developing more interpretable multi-modal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both ChartX and ChartVLM are available at: https://github.com/UniModal4Reasoning/ChartVLM <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years, but they may still generate descriptions that include objects not present in the corresponding images, a phenomenon known as object hallucination.To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text.However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms.To address these issues, we borrow the idea of unlearning and propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which can eliminate hallucinations without the need for paired data.Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets will be publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.915</span></span></p>

                  <p>Several recent deep learning (DL) based techniques perform considerably well on image-based multilingual text detection.However, their performance relies heavily on the availability and quality of training data.There are numerous types of page-level document images consisting of information in several modalities, languages, fonts, and layouts.This makes text detection a challenging problem in the field of computer vision (CV), especially for low-resource or handwritten languages.Furthermore, there is a scarcity of word-level labeled data for text detection, especially for multilingual settings and Indian scripts that incorporate both printed and handwritten text.Conventionally, Indian script text detection requires training a DL model on plenty of labeled data, but to the best of our knowledge, no relevant datasets are available.Manual annotation of such data requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise.In order to solve this problem, we propose TEXTRON, a Data Programming-based approach, where users can plug various text detection methods into a weak supervision-based learning framework.One can view this approach to multilingual text detection as an ensemble of different CV-based techniques and DL approaches.TEXTRON can leverage the predictions of DL models pre-trained on a significant amount of language data in conjunction with CV-based methods to improve text detection in other languages.We demonstrate that TEXTRON can improve the detection performance for documents written in Indian languages, despite the absence of corresponding labeled data.Further, through extensive experimentation, we show improvement brought about by our approach over the current State-of-the-art (SOTA) models, especially for handwritten Devanagari text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset has been made available at https://github.com/IITB-LEAP-OCR/TEXTRON <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.896</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emerging mobile virtual reality (VR) systems will require to continuously perform complex computer vision tasks on ultra-high-resolution video frames through the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs)-based algorithms.Since state-of-the-art DNNs require computational power that is excessive for mobile devices, techniques based on wireless edge computing (WEC) have been recently proposed.However, existing WEC methods require the transmission and processing of a high amount of video data which may ultimately saturate the wireless link.In this paper, we propose a novel Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing (SAWEC) paradigm to address this issue.SAWEC leverages knowledge about the physical environment to reduce the end-to-end latency and overall computational burden by transmitting to the edge server only the relevant data for the delivery of the service.Our intuition is that the transmission of the portion of the video frames where there are no changes with respect to previous frames can be avoided.Specifically, we leverage wireless sensing techniques to estimate the location of objects in the environment and obtain insights about the environment dynamics.Hence, only the part of the frames where any environmental change is detected is transmitted and processed.We evaluated SAWEC by using a 10K 360$^{\circ}$ camera with a Wi-Fi 6 sensing system operating at 160 MHz and performing localization and tracking.We perform experiments in an anechoic chamber and a hall room with two human subjects in six different setups.Experimental results show that SAWEC reduces the channel occupation, and end-to-end latency by 93.81%, and 96.19% respectively while improving the instance segmentation performance by 46.98% with respect to state-of-the-art WEC approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For reproducibility purposes, we pledge to share our whole dataset and code repository. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span></p>

                  <p>Timeline algorithms are key parts of online social networks, but during recent years they have been blamed for increasing polarization and disagreement in our society.Opinion-dynamics models have been used to study a variety of phenomena in online social networks, but an open question remains on how these models can be augmented to take into account the fine-grained impact of user-level timeline algorithms.We make progress on this question by providing a way to model the impact of timeline algorithms on opinion dynamics.Specifically, we show how the popular Friedkin--Johnsen opinion-formation model can be augmented based on aggregate information, extracted from timeline data.We use our model to study the problem of minimizing the polarization and disagreement; we assume that we are allowed to make small changes to the users' timeline compositions by strengthening some topics of discussion and penalizing some others.We present a gradient descent-based algorithm for this problem, and show that under realistic parameter settings, our algorithm computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n} \lg(1/\varepsilon))$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $n$ is the number of vertices.We also present an algorithm that provably computes an $\varepsilon$-approximation of our model in near-linear time.We evaluate our method on real-world data and show that it effectively reduces the polarization and disagreement in the network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we release an anonymized graph dataset with ground-truth opinions and more than 27\,000 nodes (the previously largest publicly available dataset contains less than 550 nodes). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics.These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements).While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors.These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift.For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment.In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction.HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy.Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE.Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets and videos can be found on https://hiss-csp.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

                  <p>Transfer learning aims to boost the learning on the target task leveraging knowledge learned from other relevant tasks.However, when the source and target are not closely related, the learning performance may be adversely affected, a phenomenon known as negative transfer.In this paper, we investigate the negative transfer in graph transfer learning, which is important yet underexplored.We reveal that, unlike image or text, negative transfer commonly occurs in graph-structured data, even when source and target graphs share semantic similarities.Specifically, we identify that structural differences significantly amplify the dissimilarities in the node embeddings across graphs.To mitigate this, we bring a new insight: for semantically similar graphs, although structural differences lead to significant distribution shift in node embeddings, their impact on subgraph embeddings could be marginal.Building on this insight, we introduce two effective yet elegant methods, Subgraph Pooling (SP) and Subgraph Pooling++ (SP++), that transfer subgraph-level knowledge across graphs.We theoretically analyze the role of SP in reducing graph discrepancy and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its superiority under various settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/Subgraph-Pooling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span></p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational context.Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships.However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic.This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities.The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le\'on, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020.The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to "track" contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data.The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures.The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection.The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection.The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network.Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p>Microbial communities play a key role in biological wastewater treatment processes.Activated sludge settling characteristics, for example, are affected by microbial community composition, varying by changes in operating conditions and influent characteristics of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).Timely assessment and prediction of changes in microbial composition leading to settling problems, such as filamentous bulking (FB), can prevent operational challenges, reductions in treatment efficiency, and adverse environmental impacts.This study presents an innovative computer vision-based approach to assess activated sludge-settling characteristics based on the morphological properties of flocs and filaments in microscopy images.Implementing the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing quantitative image analysis techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The offline microscopy image dataset was collected over two years, with weekly sampling at a full-scale industrial WWTP in Belgium. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>Multiple data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the CNN models.Various CNN architectures, including Inception v3, ResNet18, ResNet152, ConvNeXt-nano, and ConvNeXt-S, were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting sludge settling characteristics.The sludge volume index was used as the final prediction variable, but the method can easily be adjusted to predict any other settling metric of choice.The results showed that the suggested CNN-based approach provides less labour-intensive, objective, and consistent assessments, while transfer learning notably minimises the training phase, resulting in a generalizable system that can be employed in real-time applications.</p>

                  <p>Repetitive DNA (repeats) poses significant challenges for accurate and efficient genome assembly and sequence alignment.This is particularly true for metagenomic data, where genome dynamics such as horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and gene loss/gain complicate accurate genome assembly from metagenomic communities.Detecting repeats is a crucial first step in overcoming these challenges.To address this issue, we propose GraSSRep, a novel approach that leverages the assembly graph's structure through graph neural networks (GNNs) within a self-supervised learning framework to classify DNA sequences into repetitive and non-repetitive categories.Specifically, we frame this problem as a node classification task within a metagenomic assembly graph.In a self-supervised fashion, we rely on a high-precision (but low-recall) heuristic to generate pseudo-labels for a small proportion of the nodes.We then use those pseudo-labels to train a GNN embedding and a random forest classifier to propagate the labels to the remaining nodes.In this way, GraSSRep combines sequencing features with pre-defined and learned graph features to achieve state-of-the-art performance in repeat detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method using simulated and synthetic metagenomic datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>The results on the simulated data highlight our GraSSRep's robustness to repeat attributes, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling the complexity of repeated sequences.Additionally, our experiments with synthetic metagenomic datasets reveal that incorporating the graph structure and the GNN enhances our detection performance.Finally, in comparative analyses, GraSSRep outperforms existing repeat detection tools with respect to precision and recall.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that facilitates collaborative training of a shared global model across devices while keeping data localized.The deployment of FL in numerous real-world applications faces delays, primarily due to the prevalent reliance on supervised tasks.Generating detailed labels at edge devices, if feasible, is demanding, given resource constraints and the imperative for continuous data updates.In addressing these challenges, solutions such as federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL), which relies on unlabeled clients' data and a limited amount of labeled data on the server, become pivotal.In this paper, we propose FedAnchor, an innovative FSSL method that introduces a unique double-head structure, called anchor head, paired with the classification head trained exclusively on labeled anchor data on the server.The anchor head is empowered with a newly designed label contrastive loss based on the cosine similarity metric.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach mitigates the confirmation bias and overfitting issues associated with pseudo-labeling techniques based on high-confidence model prediction samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Extensive experiments on CIFAR10/100 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a significant margin in terms of convergence rate and model accuracy.</p>

                  <p>In the era of widespread social networks, the rapid dissemination of fake news has emerged as a significant threat, inflicting detrimental consequences across various dimensions of people's lives.Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively employed for identifying fake news.However, a significant challenge in identifying fake news is the limited availability of labeled news datasets.Therefore, the One-Class Learning (OCL) approach, utilizing only a small set of labeled data from the interest class, can be a suitable approach to address this challenge.On the other hand, representing data as a graph enables access to diverse content and structural information, and label propagation methods on graphs can be effective in predicting node labels.In this paper, we adopt a graph-based model for data representation and introduce a semi-supervised and one-class approach for fake news detection, called LOSS-GAT.Initially, we employ a two-step label propagation algorithm, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an initial classifier to categorize news into two groups: interest (fake) and non-interest (real).Subsequently, we enhance the graph structure using structural augmentation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ultimately, we predict the final labels for all unlabeled data using a GNN that induces randomness within the local neighborhood of nodes through the aggregation function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We evaluate our proposed method on five common datasets and compare the results against a set of baseline models, including both OCL and binary labeled models.The results demonstrate that LOSS-GAT achieves a notable improvement, surpassing 10%, with the advantage of utilizing only a limited set of labeled fake news.Noteworthy, LOSS-GAT even outperforms binary labeled models.</p>

                  <p>When resources are scarce, an allocation policy is needed to decide who receives a resource.This problem occurs, for instance, when allocating scarce medical resources and is often solved using modern ML methods.This paper introduces methods to evaluate index-based allocation policies -- that allocate a fixed number of resources to those who need them the most -- by using data from a randomized control trial.Such policies create dependencies between agents, which render the assumptions behind standard statistical tests invalid and limit the effectiveness of estimators.Addressing these challenges, we translate and extend recent ideas from the statistics literature to present an efficient estimator and methods for computing asymptotically correct confidence intervals.This enables us to effectively draw valid statistical conclusions, a critical gap in previous work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments validate our methodology in practical settings, while also showcasing its statistical power. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>We conclude by proposing and empirically verifying extensions of our methodology that enable us to reevaluate a past randomized control trial to evaluate different ML allocation policies in the context of a mHealth program, drawing previously invisible conclusions.</p>

                  <p>Self-Supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful method for obtaining high-quality representations from unlabeled data.However, feature suppression has recently been identified in standard contrastive learning ($e.g.$, SimCLR, CLIP): in a single end-to-end training stage, the contrastive model captures only parts of the shared information across contrasting views, while ignore the other potentially useful information.With feature suppression, contrastive models often fail to learn sufficient representations capable for various downstream tasks.To mitigate the feature suppression problem and ensure the contrastive model to learn comprehensive representations, we develop a novel Multistage Contrastive Learning (MCL) framework.Unlike standard contrastive learning that often result in feature suppression, MCL progressively learn new features that have not been explored in the previous stage, while maintaining the well-learned features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span>In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed MCL can be adapted to a variety of popular contrastive learning backbones and boost their performance by learning features that could not be gained from standard contrastive learning procedures.</p>

                  <p>Logs are widely used in the development and maintenance of software systems.Logs can help engineers understand the runtime behavior of systems and diagnose system failures.For anomaly diagnosis, existing methods generally use log event data extracted from historical logs to build diagnostic models.However, we find that existing methods do not make full use of two types of features, (1) statistical features: some inherent statistical features in log data, such as word frequency and abnormal label distribution, are not well exploited.Compared with log raw data, statistical features are deterministic and naturally compatible with corresponding tasks.(2) semantic features:Logs contain the execution logic behind software systems, thus log statements share deep semantic relationships.How to effectively combine statistical features and semantic features in log data to improve the performance of log anomaly diagnosis is the key point of this paper.In this paper, we propose an adaptive semantic gate networks (ASGNet) that combines statistical features and semantic features to selectively use statistical features to consolidate log text semantic representation.Specifically, ASGNet encodes statistical features via a variational encoding module and fuses useful information through a well-designed adaptive semantic threshold mechanism.The threshold mechanism introduces the information flow into the classifier based on the confidence of the semantic features in the decision, which is conducive to training a robust classifier and can solve the overfitting problem caused by the use of statistical features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results on the real data set show that our method proposed is superior to all baseline methods in terms of various performance indicators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.896</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning models continue to advance in accuracy, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which often lead to the misclassification of adversarial examples.Adversarial training is used to mitigate this problem by increasing robustness against these attacks.However, this approach typically reduces a model's standard accuracy on clean, non-adversarial samples.The necessity for deep learning models to balance both robustness and accuracy for security is obvious, but achieving this balance remains challenging, and the underlying reasons are yet to be clarified.This paper proposes a novel adversarial training method called Adversarial Feature Alignment (AFA), to address these problems.Our research unveils an intriguing insight: misalignment within the feature space often leads to misclassification, regardless of whether the samples are benign or adversarial.AFA mitigates this risk by employing a novel optimization algorithm based on contrastive learning to alleviate potential feature misalignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of AFA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The baseline AFA delivers higher robust accuracy than previous adversarial contrastive learning methods while minimizing the drop in clean accuracy to 1.86% and 8.91% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively, in comparison to cross-entropy.We also show that joint optimization of AFA and TRADES, accompanied by data augmentation using a recent diffusion model, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness.</p>

                  <p>The fairness-aware online learning framework has emerged as a potent tool within the context of continuous lifelong learning.In this scenario, the learner's objective is to progressively acquire new tasks as they arrive over time, while also guaranteeing statistical parity among various protected sub-populations, such as race and gender, when it comes to the newly introduced tasks.A significant limitation of current approaches lies in their heavy reliance on the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) assumption concerning data, leading to a static regret analysis of the framework.Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that achieving low static regret does not necessarily translate to strong performance in dynamic environments characterized by tasks sampled from diverse distributions.In this paper, to tackle the fairness-aware online learning challenge in evolving settings, we introduce a unique regret measure, FairSAR, by incorporating long-term fairness constraints into a strongly adapted loss regret framework.Moreover, to determine an optimal model parameter at each time step, we introduce an innovative adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, referred to as FairSAOML.This algorithm possesses the ability to adjust to dynamic environments by effectively managing bias control and model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The problem is framed as a bi-level convex-concave optimization, considering both the model's primal and dual parameters, which pertain to its accuracy and fairness attributes, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Theoretical analysis yields sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and the cumulative violation of fairness constraints.Our experimental evaluation on various real-world datasets in dynamic environments demonstrates that our proposed FairSAOML algorithm consistently outperforms alternative approaches rooted in the most advanced prior online learning methods.</p>

                  <p>The rapidly evolving multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) urgently require new benchmarks to uniformly evaluate their performance on understanding and textually describing music.However, due to semantic gaps between Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and human understanding, discrepancies between professionals and the public, and low precision of annotations, existing music description datasets cannot serve as benchmarks.To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music.We established the Caichong Music Annotation Platform (CaiMAP) that employs an innovative multi-person, multi-stage assurance method, and recruited both amateurs and professionals to ensure the precision of annotations and alignment with popular semantics.Utilizing this method, we built a dataset with multi-dimensional, high-precision music annotations, the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD), and carefully selected 1,000 high-quality entries to serve as the test set for MuChin.Based on MuChin, we analyzed the discrepancies between professionals and amateurs in terms of music description, and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of annotated data for fine-tuning LLMs.Ultimately, we employed MuChin to evaluate existing music understanding models on their ability to provide colloquial descriptions of music.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All data related to the benchmark and the code for scoring have been open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span></p>

                  <p>Adversarial attacks represent a substantial challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP).This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks.   In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation.Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively.Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks.   The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data.This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks.Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks.Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets.However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration.</p>

Methods: We investigate the effectiveness of FedAvg and FedProx to train an OCT image classification model in a decentralized fashion, addressing privacy concerns associated with centralizing data.We partitioned a publicly available OCT dataset across multiple clients under IID and Non-IID settings and conducted local training on the subsets for each client.We evaluated two federated learning methods, FedAvg and FedProx for these settings.

                  <p>In the current environment, psychological issues are prevalent and widespread, with social media serving as a key outlet for individuals to share their feelings.This results in the generation of vast quantities of data daily, where negative emotions have the potential to precipitate crisis situations.There is a recognized need for models capable of efficient analysis.While pre-trained language models have demonstrated their effectiveness broadly, there's a noticeable gap in pre-trained models tailored for specialized domains like psychology.To address this, we have collected a huge dataset from Chinese social media platforms and enriched it with publicly available datasets to create a comprehensive database encompassing 3.36 million text entries.To enhance the model's applicability to psychological text analysis, we integrated psychological lexicons into the pre-training masking mechanism.Building on an existing Chinese language model, we performed adaptive training to develop a model specialized for the psychological domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We assessed our model's effectiveness across four public benchmarks, where it not only surpassed the performance of standard pre-trained models but also showed a inclination for making psychologically relevant predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Due to concerns regarding data privacy, the dataset will not be made publicly available.However, we have made the pre-trained models and codes publicly accessible to the community via: https://github.com/zwzzzQAQ/Chinese-MentalBERT.</p>

                  <p>Over the last ten years the literature in computer science and philosophy has formulated different criteria of algorithmic fairness.One of the most discussed, classification parity, requires that the erroneous classifications of a predictive algorithm occur with equal frequency for groups picked out by protected characteristics.Despite its intuitive appeal, classification parity has come under attack.Multiple scenarios can be imagined in which - intuitively - a predictive algorithm does not treat any individual unfairly, and yet classification parity is violated.To make progress, we turn to a related principle, equal protection, originally developed in the context of criminal justice.Key to equal protection is equalizing the risks of erroneous classifications (in a sense to be specified) as opposed to equalizing the rates of erroneous classifications.We show that equal protection avoids many of the counterexamples to classification parity, but also fails to model our moral intuitions in a number of common scenarios, for example, when the predictor is causally downstream relative to the protected characteristic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these difficulties, we defend a novel principle, causal equal protection, that models the fair allocation of the risks of erroneous classification through the lenses of causality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fervent calls for more robust governance of the harms associated with artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to the adoption around the world of what regulatory scholars have called a management-based approach to regulation.Recent initiatives in the United States and Europe, as well as the adoption of major self-regulatory standards by the International Organization for Standardization, share in common a core management-based paradigm.These management-based initiatives seek to motivate an increase in human oversight of how AI tools are trained and developed.Refinements and systematization of human-guided training techniques will thus be needed to fit within this emerging era of management-based regulatory paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If taken seriously, human-guided training can alleviate some of the technical and ethical pressures on AI, boosting AI performance with human intuition as well as better addressing the needs for fairness and effective explainability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>In this paper, we discuss the connection between the emerging management-based regulatory frameworks governing AI and the need for human oversight during training.We broadly cover some of the technical components involved in human-guided training and then argue that the kinds of high-stakes use cases for AI that appear of most concern to regulators should lean more on human-guided training than on data-only training.We hope to foster a discussion between legal scholars and computer scientists involving how to govern a domain of technology that is vast, heterogenous, and dynamic in its applications and risks.</p>

We consider several problems to demonstrate the performance of the framework in learning both static and time-dependent PDEs on non-rigid geometries; these include solving the Laplace equation, reaction-diffusion equations, and a multiscale PDE that characterizes the electrical propagation on the left ventricle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work paves the way toward the fast prediction of PDE solutions on a family of domains and the application of neural operators in engineering and precision medicine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

We show that this problem is NP-complete for many simple classes of graphs, the problem of determining the fastest schedule, defined by the number of time steps required for a robot to visit every vertex in the schedule and complete every task assigned in its assigned schedule.Explicitly, we provide this result for complete graphs, bipartite graphs, star graphs, and planar graphs.Finally, we provide positive results for line graphs, showing that we can find an optimal set of schedules for $k$ robots completing $m$ tasks of equal length of a path of length $n$ in $O(kmn)$ time, and a $k$-approximation when the length of the tasks is unbounded.</p>

                  <p>Associative memory and probabilistic modeling are two fundamental topics in artificial intelligence.The first studies recurrent neural networks designed to denoise, complete and retrieve data, whereas the second studies learning and sampling from probability distributions.Based on the observation that associative memory's energy functions can be seen as probabilistic modeling's negative log likelihoods, we build a bridge between the two that enables useful flow of ideas in both directions.We showcase four examples: First, we propose new energy-based models that flexibly adapt their energy functions to new in-context datasets, an approach we term \textit{in-context learning of energy functions}.Second, we propose two new associative memory models: one that dynamically creates new memories as necessitated by the training data using Bayesian nonparametrics, and another that explicitly computes proportional memory assignments using the evidence lower bound.Third, using tools from associative memory, we analytically and numerically characterize the memory capacity of Gaussian kernel density estimators, a widespread tool in probababilistic modeling.Fourth, we study a widespread implementation choice in transformers -- normalization followed by self attention -- to show it performs clustering on the hypersphere.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Altogether, this work urges further exchange of useful ideas between these two continents of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gradient Boost Decision Trees (GBDT) is a powerful additive model based on tree ensembles.Its nature makes GBDT a black-box model even though there are multiple explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models obtaining information by reinterpreting the model globally and locally.Each tree of the ensemble is a transparent model itself but the final outcome is the result of a sum of these trees and it is not easy to clarify.   In this paper, a feature contribution method for GBDT is developed.The proposed method takes advantage of the GBDT architecture to calculate the contribution of each feature using the residue of each node.This algorithm allows to calculate the sequence of node decisions given a prediction.   Theoretical proofs and multiple experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our method which is not only a local explicability model for the GBDT algorithm but also a unique option that reflects GBDTs internal behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposal is aligned to the contribution of characteristics having impact in some artificial intelligence problems such as ethical analysis of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and comply with the new European laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) about the right to explain and nondiscrimination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span></p>

In this paper, we present UR2M, a novel Uncertainty and Resource-aware event detection framework for MCUs.Specifically, we (i) develop an uncertainty-aware WED based on evidential theory for accurate event detection and reliable uncertainty estimation; (ii) introduce a cascade ML framework to achieve efficient model inference via early exits, by sharing shallower model layers among different event models; (iii) optimize the deployment of the model and MCU library for system efficiency.We conducted extensive experiments and compared UR2M to traditional uncertainty baselines using three wearable datasets.Our results demonstrate that UR2M achieves up to 864% faster inference speed, 857% energy-saving for uncertainty estimation, 55% memory saving on two popular MCUs, and a 22% improvement in uncertainty quantification performance.   UR2M can be deployed on a wide range of MCUs, significantly expanding real-time and reliable WED applications.</p>
