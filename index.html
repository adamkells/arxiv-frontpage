                  <p>In this paper, we address the problem of plausible object placement for the challenging task of realistic image composition.We propose DiffPop, the first framework that utilizes plausibility-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn the scale and spatial relations among multiple objects and the corresponding scene image.First, we train an unguided diffusion model to directly learn the object placement parameters in a self-supervised manner.Then, we develop a human-in-the-loop pipeline which exploits human labeling on the diffusion-generated composite images to provide the weak supervision for training a structural plausibility classifier.The classifier is further used to guide the diffusion sampling process towards generating the plausible object placement.Experimental results verify the superiority of our method for producing plausible and diverse composite images on the new Cityscapes-OP dataset and the public OPA dataset, as well as demonstrate its potential in applications such as data augmentation and multi-object placement tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.968</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is important for video enhancement, frame rate up-conversion, and slow-motion generation.The introduction of event cameras, which capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, has significantly enhanced VFI capabilities, particularly for high-speed, nonlinear motions.However, these event-based methods encounter challenges in low-light conditions, notably trailing artifacts and signal latency, which hinder their direct applicability and generalization.Addressing these issues, we propose a novel per-scene optimization strategy tailored for low-light conditions.This approach utilizes the internal statistics of a sequence to handle degraded event data under low-light conditions, improving the generalizability to different lighting and camera settings.To evaluate its robustness in low-light condition, we further introduce EVFI-LL, a unique RGB+Event dataset captured under low-light conditions.Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in low-light environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span>Project page: https://naturezhanghn.github.io/sim2real.</p>

                  <p>Seeing clearly with high resolution is a foundation of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which has been proven to be vital for visual perception and reasoning.Existing works usually employ a straightforward resolution upscaling method, where the image consists of global and local branches, with the latter being the sliced image patches but resized to the same resolution as the former.This means that higher resolution requires more local patches, resulting in exorbitant computational expenses, and meanwhile, the dominance of local image tokens may diminish the global context.In this paper, we dive into the problems and propose a new framework as well as an elaborate optimization strategy.Specifically, we extract contextual information from the global view using a mixture of adapters, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks.With regard to local patches, learnable query embeddings are introduced to reduce image tokens, the most important tokens accounting for the user question will be further selected by a similarity-based selector.Our empirical results demonstrate a `less is more' pattern, where \textit{utilizing fewer but more informative local image tokens leads to improved performance}.Besides, a significant challenge lies in the training strategy, as simultaneous end-to-end training of the global mining block and local compression block does not yield optimal results.We thus advocate for an alternating training way, ensuring balanced learning between global and local aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we also introduce a challenging dataset with high requirements for image detail, enhancing the training of the local compression layer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>The proposed method, termed LMM with Sophisticated Tasks, Local image compression, and Mixture of global Experts (SliME), achieves leading performance across various benchmarks with only 2 million training data.</p>

                  <p>The sparse dictionary coding framework represents signals as a linear combination of a few predefined dictionary atoms.It has been employed for images, time series, graph signals and recently for 2-way (or 2D) spatio-temporal data employing jointly temporal and spatial dictionaries.Large and over-complete dictionaries enable high-quality models, but also pose scalability challenges which are exacerbated in multi-dictionary settings.Hence, an important problem that we address in this paper is: How to scale multi-dictionary coding for large dictionaries and datasets?   We propose a multi-dictionary atom selection technique for low-rank sparse coding named LRMDS.To enable scalability to large dictionaries and datasets, it progressively selects groups of row-column atom pairs based on their alignment with the data and performs convex relaxation coding via the corresponding sub-dictionaries.We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that when the data has a low-rank encoding with a sparse subset of the atoms, LRMDS is able to select them with strong guarantees under mild assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and quality of LRMDS in both synthetic and real-world datasets and for a range of coding dictionaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>It achieves 3X to 10X speed-up compared to baselines, while obtaining up to two orders of magnitude improvement in representation quality on some of the real world datasets given a fixed target number of atoms.</p>

                  <p>Automatic methods for generating and gathering linguistic data have proven effective for fine-tuning Language Models (LMs) in languages less resourced than English.Still, while there has been emphasis on data quantity, less attention has been given to its quality.In this work, we investigate the impact of human intervention on machine-generated data when fine-tuning dialogical models.In particular, we study (1) whether post-edited dialogues exhibit higher perceived quality compared to the originals that were automatically generated; (2) whether fine-tuning with post-edited dialogues results in noticeable differences in the generated outputs; and (3) whether post-edited dialogues influence the outcomes when considering the parameter size of the LMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end we created HED-IT, a large-scale dataset where machine-generated dialogues are paired with the version post-edited by humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>Using both the edited and unedited portions of HED-IT, we fine-tuned three different sizes of an LM.Results from both human and automatic evaluation show that the different quality of training data is clearly perceived and it has an impact also on the models trained on such data.Additionally, our findings indicate that larger models are less sensitive to data quality, whereas this has a crucial impact on smaller models.These results enhance our comprehension of the impact of human intervention on training data in the development of high-quality LMs.</p>

                  <p>Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict four aspect-based elements, including aspect term, opinion term, aspect category, and sentiment polarity.In practice, unseen aspects, due to distinct data distribution, impose many challenges for a trained neural model.Motivated by this, this work formulates ASQP into the few-shot scenario, which aims for fast adaptation in real applications.Therefore, we first construct a few-shot ASQP dataset (FSQP) that contains richer categories and is more balanced for the few-shot study.Moreover, recent methods extract quads through a generation paradigm, which involves converting the input sentence into a templated target sequence.However, they primarily focus on the utilization of a single template or the consideration of different template orders, thereby overlooking the correlations among various templates.To tackle this issue, we further propose a Broadview Soft Prompting (BvSP) method that aggregates multiple templates with a broader view by taking into account the correlation between the different templates.Specifically, BvSP uses the pre-trained language model to select the most relevant k templates with Jensen-Shannon divergence.BvSP further introduces soft prompts to guide the pre-trained language model using the selected templates.Then, we aggregate the results of multi-templates by voting mechanism.Empirical results demonstrate that BvSP significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art methods under four few-shot settings and other public datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/byinhao/BvSP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.947</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as knowledge bases and significant in-context reasoning capabilities.However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt.This paper focuses on a significant facet of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge.We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs.Using this dataset, we evaluated the LLaMA2-13B-chat model and discovered that its proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings.Moreover, training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement.Training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge.Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability.Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset used in this study is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ID-OCKR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern alignment techniques based on human preferences, such as RLHF and DPO, typically employ divergence regularization relative to the reference model to ensure training stability.However, this often limits the flexibility of models during alignment, especially when there is a clear distributional discrepancy between the preference data and the reference model.In this paper, we focus on the alignment of recent text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and find that this "reference mismatch" is indeed a significant problem in aligning these models due to the unstructured nature of visual modalities: e.g., a preference for a particular stylistic aspect can easily induce such a discrepancy.Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel and memory-friendly preference alignment method for diffusion models that does not depend on any reference model, coined margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO).MaPO jointly maximizes the likelihood margin between the preferred and dispreferred image sets and the likelihood of the preferred sets, simultaneously learning general stylistic features and preferences.For evaluation, we introduce two new pairwise preference datasets, which comprise self-generated image pairs from SDXL, Pick-Style and Pick-Safety, simulating diverse scenarios of reference mismatch.Our experiments validate that MaPO can significantly improve alignment on Pick-Style and Pick-Safety and general preference alignment when used with Pick-a-Pic v2, surpassing the base SDXL and other existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, models, and datasets are publicly available via https://mapo-t2i.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images.This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images.While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing.However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts.We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements.We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</p>

                  <p>The development of multi-modal object detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically relies on a large amount of pixel-aligned multi-modal image data.However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations.To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV-based object detection dataset, UEMM-Air.Specially, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE).Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 20k pairs of images with 5 modalities and precise annotations.Moreover, we conduct numerous experiments and establish new benchmark results on our dataset.We found that models pre-trained on UEMM-Air exhibit better performance on downstream tasks compared to other similar datasets.The dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) to support the research of multi-modal UAV object detection models.</p>

                  <p>Distributed databases are fundamental infrastructures of today's large-scale software systems such as cloud systems.Detecting anomalies in distributed databases is essential for maintaining software availability.Existing approaches, predominantly developed using Loghub-a comprehensive collection of log datasets from various systems-lack datasets specifically tailored to distributed databases, which exhibit unique anomalies.Additionally, there's a notable absence of datasets encompassing multi-anomaly, multi-node logs.Consequently, models built upon these datasets, primarily designed for standalone systems, are inadequate for distributed databases, and the prevalent method of deeming an entire cluster anomalous based on irregularities in a single node leads to a high false-positive rate.This paper addresses the unique anomalies and multivariate nature of logs in distributed databases.We expose the first open-sourced, comprehensive dataset with multivariate logs from distributed databases.Utilizing this dataset, we conduct an extensive study to identify multiple database anomalies and to assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art anomaly detection using multivariate log data.Our findings reveal that relying solely on logs from a single node is insufficient for accurate anomaly detection on distributed database.Leveraging these insights, we propose MultiLog, an innovative multivariate log-based anomaly detection approach tailored for distributed databases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments, based on this novel dataset, demonstrate MultiLog's superiority, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by approximately 12%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) have been widely utilized to address resource allocation problems with Markov reward processes (MRPs).Existing works often assume that the dynamics of MRPs are known prior, which makes the RMAB problem solvable from an optimization perspective.Nevertheless, an efficient learning-based solution for RMABs with unknown system dynamics remains an open problem.In this paper, we study the cooperative resource allocation problem with unknown system dynamics of MRPs.This problem can be modeled as a multi-agent online RMAB problem, where multiple agents collaboratively learn the system dynamics while maximizing their accumulated rewards.We devise a federated online RMAB framework to mitigate the communication overhead and data privacy issue by adopting the federated learning paradigm.Based on this framework, we put forth a Federated Thompson Sampling-enabled Whittle Index (FedTSWI) algorithm to solve this multi-agent online RMAB problem.The FedTSWI algorithm enjoys a high communication and computation efficiency, and a privacy guarantee.Moreover, we derive a regret upper bound for the FedTSWI algorithm.Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the case of online multi-user multi-channel access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ and better performance compared with baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>More importantly, its sample complexity decreases with the number of agents.</p>

                  <p>Tabular synthesis models remain ineffective at capturing complex dependencies, and the quality of synthetic data is still insufficient for comprehensive downstream tasks, such as prediction under distribution shifts, automated decision-making, and cross-table understanding.A major challenge is the lack of prior knowledge about underlying structures and high-order relationships in tabular data.We argue that a systematic evaluation on high-order structural information for tabular data synthesis is the first step towards solving the problem.In this paper, we introduce high-order structural causal information as natural prior knowledge and provide a benchmark framework for the evaluation of tabular synthesis models.The framework allows us to generate benchmark datasets with a flexible range of data generation processes and to train tabular synthesis models using these datasets for further evaluation.We propose multiple benchmark tasks, high-order metrics, and causal inference tasks as downstream tasks for evaluating the quality of synthetic data generated by the trained models.Our experiments demonstrate to leverage the benchmark framework for evaluating the model capability of capturing high-order structural causal information.Furthermore, our benchmarking results provide an initial assessment of state-of-the-art tabular synthesis models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They have clearly revealed significant gaps between ideal and actual performance and how baseline methods differ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark framework is available at URL https://github.com/TURuibo/CauTabBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs).Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights, their alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI.High human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent existing open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively, potentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets.Is it possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM?We present a self-synthesis method for generating large-scale alignment data named Magpie.Our key observation is that aligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only the left-side templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks to their auto-regressive nature.We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct and generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses.We perform a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data and select 300K high-quality instances.To compare Magpie data with other public instruction datasets, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models.Our results indicate that in some tasks, models fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and subsequent feedback learning.We also show that using Magpie solely for SFT can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This advantage is evident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we propose a two-stage sign language production (SLP) paradigm that first encodes sign language sequences into discrete codes and then autoregressively generates sign language from text based on the learned codebook.However, existing vector quantization (VQ) methods are fixed-length encodings, overlooking the uneven information density in sign language, which leads to under-encoding of important regions and over-encoding of unimportant regions.To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic vector quantization (DVA-VAE) model that can dynamically adjust the encoding length based on the information density in sign language to achieve accurate and compact encoding.Then, a GPT-like model learns to generate code sequences and their corresponding durations from spoken language text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>To promote sign language research, we propose a new large German sign language dataset, PHOENIX-News, which contains 486 hours of sign language videos, audio, and transcription texts.Experimental analysis on PHOENIX-News shows that the performance of our model can be further improved by increasing the size of the training data.Our project homepage is https://t2sgpt-demo.yinaoxiong.cn.</p>

                  <p>Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common.It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries.In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score.Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only.In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's.In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation.We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not.Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID.Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.</p>

                  <p>The Bhutanese government is increasing its utilization of technological approaches such as including Remote Sensing-based knowledge in their decision-making process.This study focuses on crop type and crop extent in Paro, one of the top rice-yielding districts in Bhutan, and employs publicly available NICFI high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet.Two Deep Learning (DL) approaches, point-based (DNN) and patch-based (U-Net), models were used in conjunction with cloud-computing platforms.Three different models per DL approaches (DNN and U-Net) were trained: 1) RGBN channels from Planet; 2) RGBN and elevation data (RGBNE); 3) RGBN and Sentinel-1 (S1) data (RGBNS), and RGBN with E and S1 data (RGBNES).From this comprehensive analysis, the U-Net displayed higher performance metrics across both model training and model validation efforts.Among the U-Net model sets, the RGBN, RGBNE, RGBNS, and RGBNES models had an F1-score of 0.8546, 0.8563, 0.8467, and 0.8500 respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An independent model evaluation was performed and found a high level of performance variation across all the metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>For this independent model evaluation, the U-Net RGBN, RGBNE, RGBNES, and RGBN models displayed the F1-scores of 0.5935, 0.6154, 0.5882, and 0.6582, suggesting U-Net RGBNES as the best model.The study shows that the DL approaches can predict rice.Also, DL methods can be used with the survey-based approaches currently utilized by the Bhutan Department of Agriculture.Further, this study demonstrated the usage of regional land cover products such as SERVIR's RLCMS as a weak label approach to capture different strata addressing the class imbalance problem and improving the sampling design for DL application.Finally, through preliminary model testing and comparisons outlined it was shown that using additional features such as NDVI, EVI, and NDWI did not drastically improve model performance.</p>

                  <p>In 1907, Sir Francis Galton independently asked 787 villagers to estimate the weight of an ox.Although none of them guessed the exact weight, the average estimate was remarkably accurate.This phenomenon is known as wisdom of crowds.In a clever experiment, Asch employed actors to demonstrate the human tendency to conform to others' opinions.The question we ask is: what would Sir Francis Galton have observed if Asch had interfered by employing actors?Would the wisdom of crowds become even wiser or not?The problem becomes intriguing when considering the inter-connectedness of the villagers, which is the central theme of this work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We examine a scenario where $n$ agents are interconnected and influence each other. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.578</span></span>The average of their opinions provides an estimator of a certain quality for some unknown quantity.How can one improve or reduce the quality of the original estimator in terms of the MSE by utilizing Asch's strategy of hiring a few stooges?   We present a new formulation of this problem, assuming that nodes adjust their opinions according to the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics.We demonstrate that selecting $k$ stooges for maximizing and minimizing the MSE is NP-hard.We also demonstrate that our formulation is closely related to maximizing or minimizing polarization and show NP-hardness.We propose an efficient greedy heuristic that scales to large networks and test our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets.Although MSE and polarization objectives differ, we find in practice that maximizing polarization often yields solutions that are nearly optimal for minimizing the wisdom of crowds in terms of MSE.Our analysis of real-world data reveals that even a small number of stooges can significantly influence the conversation on the war in Ukraine, resulting in a relative increase of the MSE of 207.80% (maximization) or a decrease of 50.62% (minimization).</p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalized recommender systems, the challenge of adapting to evolving user preferences and the continuous influx of new users and items is paramount.Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands.Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution.However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies.To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation.Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views.After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph.Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views.These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated.Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</p>

                  <p>Rowhammer is a security vulnerability that allows unauthorized attackers to induce errors within DRAM cells.To prevent fault injections from escalating to successful attacks, a widely accepted mitigation is implementing fault checks on instructions and data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We challenge the validity of this assumption by examining the impact of the fault on the victim's functionality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Specifically, we illustrate that an attacker can construct a profile of the victim's memory based on the directional patterns of bit flips.This profile is then utilized to identify the most susceptible bit locations within DRAM rows.These locations are then subsequently leveraged during an online attack phase with side information observed from the change in the victim's behavior to deduce sensitive bit values.Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to utilize Rowhammer as a probe, shifting the emphasis away from the victim's memory integrity and toward statistical fault analysis (SFA) based on the victim's operational behavior.   We show FAULT+PROBE may be used to circumvent the verify-after-sign fault check mechanism, which is designed to prevent the generation of erroneous signatures that leak sensitive information.It does so by injecting directional faults into key positions identified during a memory profiling stage.The attacker observes the signature generation rate and decodes the secret bit value accordingly.This circumvention is enabled by an observable channel in the victim.FAULT+PROBE is not limited to signing victims and can be used to probe secret bits on arbitrary systems where an observable channel is present that leaks the result of the fault injection attempt.To demonstrate the attack, we target the fault-protected ECDSA in wolfSSL's implementation of the TLS 1.3 handshake.We recover 256-bit session keys with an average recovery rate of 22 key bits/hour and a 100% success rate.</p>

                  <p>Text classification is a crucial task encountered frequently in practical scenarios, yet it is still under-explored in the era of large language models (LLMs).This study shows that LLMs are vulnerable to changes in the number and arrangement of options in text classification.Our extensive empirical analyses reveal that the key bottleneck arises from ambiguous decision boundaries and inherent biases towards specific tokens and positions.To mitigate these issues, we make the first attempt and propose a novel two-stage classification framework for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is grounded in the empirical observation that pairwise comparisons can effectively alleviate boundary ambiguity and inherent bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>Specifically, we begin with a self-reduction technique to efficiently narrow down numerous options, which contributes to reduced decision space and a faster comparison process.Subsequently, pairwise contrastive comparisons are employed in a chain-of-thought manner to draw out nuances and distinguish confusable options, thus refining the ambiguous decision boundary.Extensive experiments on four datasets (Banking77, HWU64, LIU54, and Clinic150) verify the effectiveness of our framework.Furthermore, benefitting from our framework, various LLMs can achieve consistent improvements.Our code and data are available in \url{https://github.com/Chuge0335/PC-CoT}.</p>

                  <p>Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common.It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries.In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score.Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation.We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not.Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated.Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures.We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID.Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.</p>

                  <p>Recently, vision model pre-training has evolved from relying on manually annotated datasets to leveraging large-scale, web-crawled image-text data.Despite these advances, there is no pre-training method that effectively exploits the interleaved image-text data, which is very prevalent on the Internet.Inspired by the recent success of compression learning in natural language processing, we propose a novel vision model pre-training method called Latent Compression Learning (LCL) for interleaved image-text data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method performs latent compression learning by maximizing the mutual information between the inputs and outputs of a causal attention model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>The training objective can be decomposed into two basic tasks: 1) contrastive learning between visual representation and preceding context, and 2) generating subsequent text based on visual representation.Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only matches the performance of CLIP on paired pre-training datasets (e.g., LAION), but can also leverage interleaved pre-training data (e.g., MMC4) to learn robust visual representation from scratch, showcasing the potential of vision model pre-training with interleaved image-text data.Code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LCL.</p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the performance of source-domain pretrained models when tested on unknown shifted target domains.Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data.Recently, diffusion-driven TTA methods have demonstrated strong performance by using an unconditional diffusion model, which is also trained on the source domain to transform target data into synthetic data as a source domain projection.This allows the source model to make predictions without weight adaptation.In this paper, we argue that the domains of the source model and the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA methods are not aligned.To adapt the source model to the synthetic domain of the unconditional diffusion model, we introduce a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data.Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset.Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process mitigates the potential domain gap between the conditional and unconditional models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Diffusion-Driven-Test-Time-Adaptation-via-Synthetic-Domain-Alignment.</p>

                  <p>Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change.Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations.These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections.Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard.However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation.We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training.First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered.Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features.We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.</p>

                  <p>The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions have posed challenges in accurate soft robot control.Neural networks, especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely leveraged for this issue due to their nonlinear activation functions and recurrent structures.Although they have shown satisfying accuracy in most tasks, these black-box approaches are not explainable, and hence, they are unsuitable for areas with high safety requirements, like robot-assisted surgery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the RNN controllers, we propose a data-driven explainable controller (DDEC) whose parameters can be updated online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>We discuss the Jacobian controller and kinematics controller in theory and demonstrate that they are only special cases of DDEC.Moreover, we utilize RNN, the Jacobian controller, the kinematics controller, and DDECs for trajectory following tasks.Experimental results have shown that our approach outperforms the other controllers considering trajectory following errors while being explainable.We also conduct a study to explore and explain the functions of each DDEC component.This is the first interpretable soft robot controller that overcomes the shortcomings of both NN controllers and interpretable controllers.Future work may involve proposing different DDECs based on different RNN controllers and exploiting them for high-safety-required applications.</p>

                  <p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable.In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability.Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage.Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting.These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations.They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces \emph{VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction)}, a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks.We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments.In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.</p>

We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms.In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem.For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.</p>

We present a new formulation of this problem, assuming that nodes adjust their opinions according to the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics.We demonstrate that selecting $k$ stooges for maximizing and minimizing the MSE is NP-hard.We also demonstrate that our formulation is closely related to maximizing or minimizing polarization and show NP-hardness.We propose an efficient greedy heuristic that scales to large networks and test our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets.Although MSE and polarization objectives differ, we find in practice that maximizing polarization often yields solutions that are nearly optimal for minimizing the wisdom of crowds in terms of MSE.Our analysis of real-world data reveals that even a small number of stooges can significantly influence the conversation on the war in Ukraine, resulting in a relative increase of the MSE of 207.80% (maximization) or a decrease of 50.62% (minimization).</p>

                  <p>Large language model systems face important security risks from maliciously crafted messages that aim to overwrite the system's original instructions or leak private data.To study this problem, we organized a capture-the-flag competition at IEEE SaTML 2024, where the flag is a secret string in the LLM system prompt.The competition was organized in two phases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the first phase, teams developed defenses to prevent the model from leaking the secret. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>During the second phase, teams were challenged to extract the secrets hidden for defenses proposed by the other teams.This report summarizes the main insights from the competition.Notably, we found that all defenses were bypassed at least once, highlighting the difficulty of designing a successful defense and the necessity for additional research to protect LLM systems.To foster future research in this direction, we compiled a dataset with over 137k multi-turn attack chats and open-sourced the platform.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed natural language processing, enabling machines to generate human-like text and engage in meaningful conversations.This development necessitates speed, efficiency, and accessibility in LLM inference as the computational and memory requirements of these systems grow exponentially.Meanwhile, advancements in computing and memory capabilities are lagging behind, exacerbated by the discontinuation of Moore's law.With LLMs exceeding the capacity of single GPUs, they require complex, expert-level configurations for parallel processing.Memory accesses become significantly more expensive than computation, posing a challenge for efficient scaling, known as the memory wall.Here, compute-in-memory (CIM) technologies offer a promising solution for accelerating AI inference by directly performing analog computations in memory, potentially reducing latency and power consumption.By closely integrating memory and compute elements, CIM eliminates the von Neumann bottleneck, reducing data movement and improving energy efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This survey paper provides an overview and analysis of transformer-based models, reviewing various CIM architectures and exploring how they can address the imminent challenges of modern AI computing systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.569</span></span>We discuss transformer-related operators and their hardware acceleration schemes and highlight challenges, trends, and insights in corresponding CIM designs.</p>

                  <p>The translation of gender-neutral person-referring terms (e.g., the students) is often non-trivial.Translating from English into German poses an interesting case -- in German, person-referring nouns are usually gender-specific, and if the gender of the referent(s) is unknown or diverse, the generic masculine (die Studenten (m.)) is commonly used.This solution, however, reduces the visibility of other genders, such as women and non-binary people.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To counteract gender discrimination, a societal movement towards using gender-fair language exists (e.g., by adopting neosystems). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>However, gender-fair German is currently barely supported in machine translation (MT), requiring post-editing or manual translations.We address this research gap by studying gender-fair language in English-to-German MT.Concretely, we enrich a community-created gender-fair language dictionary and sample multi-sentence test instances from encyclopedic text and parliamentary speeches.Using these novel resources, we conduct the first benchmark study involving two commercial systems and six neural MT models for translating words in isolation and natural contexts across two domains.Our findings show that most systems produce mainly masculine forms and rarely gender-neutral variants, highlighting the need for future research.We release code and data at https://github.com/g8a9/building-bridges-gender-fair-german-mt.</p>
