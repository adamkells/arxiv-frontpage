                  <p>Interactive virtual humanoid agent is a crucial interface with the physical world.A relatively complete humanoid agent first needs to have face and body, then possess both verbal and non-verbal (such as eye contact, facial expression, lip motion, gesture, and manipulation) abilities, and finally, it is capable of real-time duplex communication, e.g., the ability to actively interrupt conversations.Most prior systems typically only consider a subset of these elements, leaving a gap from realistic humanoid agent.In this work, we propose a real-time, duplex, interactive end-to-end network capable of modeling realistic agent behaviors, including speech, full-body movements for talking, responding, idling, and manipulation.This system is a multimodal model integrating audio and visual inputs, extended from a pre-trained large language model (LLM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect approximately 200,000 hours of audio, around 130,000 hours of video data, and about 20,000 alignment samples to build the model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>The final model demonstrates capabilities that are difficult to achieve in previous systems, such as generalized object manipulation.This work performs a preliminary exploration of the end-to-end approach in this field, aiming to inspire further research towards scaling up.</p>

                  <p>With growing interest in recent years, medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) has rapidly evolved, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging as an alternative to classical model architectures.Specifically, their ability to add visual information to the input of pre-trained LLMs brings new capabilities for image interpretation.However, simple visual errors cast doubt on the actual visual understanding abilities of these models.To address this, region-based questions have been proposed as a means to assess and enhance actual visual understanding through compositional evaluation.To combine these two perspectives, this paper introduces targeted visual prompting to equip MLLMs with region-based questioning capabilities.By presenting the model with both the isolated region and the region in its context in a customized visual prompt, we show the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets while comparing it to several baseline models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/sergiotasconmorales/locvqallm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks.Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances.Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions.By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation.Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks.Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method for image understanding tasks under Curriculum Learning (CL) paradigm which leverages RGB-D. The method utilizes Multi-Modal Contrastive Masked Autoencoder and Denoising techniques.Recent approaches either use masked autoencoding (e.g., MultiMAE) or contrastive learning(e.g., Pri3D, or combine them in a single contrastive masked autoencoder architecture such as CMAE and CAV-MAE.However, none of the single contrastive masked autoencoder is applicable to RGB-D datasets.To improve the performance and efficacy of such methods, we propose a new pre-training strategy based on CL.Specifically, in the first stage, we pre-train the model using contrastive learning to learn cross-modal representations.In the second stage, we initialize the modality-specific encoders using the weights from the first stage and then pre-train the model using masked autoencoding and denoising/noise prediction used in diffusion models.Masked autoencoding focuses on reconstructing the missing patches in the input modality using local spatial correlations, while denoising learns high frequency components of the input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is scalable, robust and suitable for pre-training with limited RGB-D datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as ScanNet, NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D show the efficacy and superior performance of our approach.Specifically, we show an improvement of +1.0% mIoU against Mask3D on ScanNet semantic segmentation.We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in low-data regime by evaluating it for semantic segmentation task against the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Unsupervised 3D keypoints estimation from Point Cloud Data (PCD) is a complex task, even more challenging when an object shape is deforming.As keypoints should be semantically and geometrically consistent across all the 3D frames - each keypoint should be anchored to a specific part of the deforming shape irrespective of intrinsic and extrinsic motion.This paper presents, "SelfGeo", a self-supervised method that computes persistent 3D keypoints of non-rigid objects from arbitrary PCDs without the need of human annotations.The gist of SelfGeo is to estimate keypoints between frames that respect invariant properties of deforming bodies.Our main contribution is to enforce that keypoints deform along with the shape while keeping constant geodesic distances among them.This principle is then propagated to the design of a set of losses which minimization let emerge repeatable keypoints in specific semantic locations of the non-rigid shape.We show experimentally that the use of geodesic has a clear advantage in challenging dynamic scenes and with different classes of deforming shapes (humans and animals).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/IIT-PAVIS/SelfGeo <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span></p>

                  <p>Researchers in the highly active field of intrusion detection largely rely on public datasets for their experimental evaluations.However, the large number of existing datasets, the discovery of previously unknown flaws therein, and the frequent publication of new datasets make it hard to select suitable options and sufficiently understand their respective limitations.Hence, there is a great risk of drawing invalid conclusions from experimental results with respect to detection performance of novel methods in the real world.While there exist various surveys on intrusion detection datasets, they have deficiencies in providing researchers with a profound decision basis since they lack comprehensiveness, actionable details, and up-to-dateness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present COMIDDS, an ongoing effort to comprehensively survey intrusion detection datasets with an unprecedented level of detail, implemented as a website backed by a public GitHub repository. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span>COMIDDS allows researchers to quickly identify suitable datasets depending on their requirements and provides structured and critical information on each dataset, including actual data samples and links to relevant publications.COMIDDS is freely accessible, regularly updated, and open to contributions.</p>

                  <p>Cybercrime and the market for cyber-related compromises are becoming attractive revenue sources for state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals and technical individuals affected by financial hardships.Due to burgeoning cybercrime on new technological frontiers, efforts have been made to assist digital forensic investigators (DFI) and law enforcement agencies (LEA) in their investigative efforts.   Forensic tool innovations and ontology developments, such as the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE), have been proposed to assist DFI and LEA.Although these tools and ontologies are useful, they lack extensive information sharing and tool interoperability features, and the ontologies lack the latest Smart City Infrastructure (SCI) context that was proposed.   To mitigate the weaknesses in both solutions and to ensure a safer cyber-physical environment for all, we propose the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE), an expansion profile of the UCO and CASE ontology that implements SCI threat models, SCI digital forensic evidence, attack techniques, patterns and classifications from MITRE.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We showcase how SCOPE could present complex data such as SCI-specific threats, cybercrime, investigation data and incident handling workflows via an incident scenario modelled after publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>We also make SCOPE available to the community so that threats, digital evidence and cybercrime in emerging trends such as SCI can be identified, represented, and shared collaboratively.</p>

                  <p>Perception systems of autonomous vehicles are susceptible to occlusion, especially when examined from a vehicle-centric perspective.Such occlusion can lead to overlooked object detections, e.g., larger vehicles such as trucks or buses may create blind spots where cyclists or pedestrians could be obscured, accentuating the safety concerns associated with such perception system limitations.To mitigate these challenges, the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigm suggests employing an infrastructure-side perception system (IPS) to complement autonomous vehicles with a broader perceptual scope.Nevertheless, the scarcity of real-world 3D infrastructure-side datasets constrains the advancement of V2X technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces a new 3D infrastructure-side collaborative perception dataset, abbreviated as inscope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Notably, InScope is the first dataset dedicated to addressing occlusion challenges by strategically deploying multiple-position Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems on the infrastructure side.Specifically, InScope encapsulates a 20-day capture duration with 303 tracking trajectories and 187,787 3D bounding boxes annotated by experts.Through analysis of benchmarks, four different benchmarks are presented for open traffic scenarios, including collaborative 3D object detection, multisource data fusion, data domain transfer, and 3D multiobject tracking tasks.Additionally, a new metric is designed to quantify the impact of occlusion, facilitating the evaluation of detection degradation ratios among various algorithms.The Experimental findings showcase the enhanced performance of leveraging InScope to assist in detecting and tracking 3D multiobjects in real-world scenarios, particularly in tracking obscured, small, and distant objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/xf-zh/InScope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets.Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span></p>

                  <p>Technological advances facilitate the ability to acquire multimodal data, posing a challenge for recognition systems while also providing an opportunity to use the heterogeneous nature of the information to increase the generalization capability of models.An often overlooked issue is the cost of the labeling process, which is typically high due to the need for a significant investment in time and money associated with human experts.Existing semi-supervised learning methods often focus on operating in the feature space created by the fusion of available modalities, neglecting the potential for cross-utilizing complementary information available in each modality.To address this problem, we propose Cross-Modality Clustering-based Self-Labeling (CMCSL).Based on a small set of pre-labeled data, CMCSL groups instances belonging to each modality in the deep feature space and then propagates known labels within the resulting clusters.Next, information about the instances' class membership in each modality is exchanged based on the Euclidean distance to ensure more accurate labeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluation conducted on 20 datasets derived from the MM-IMDb dataset indicates that cross-propagation of labels between modalities -- especially when the number of pre-labeled instances is small -- can allow for more reliable labeling and thus increase the classification performance in each modality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models have become cornerstone technologies, driving innovation in diverse fields from art creation to healthcare.Despite their potential, these models face the significant challenge of data memorization, which poses risks to privacy and the integrity of generated content.Among various metrics of memorization detection, our study delves into the memorization scores calculated from encoder layer embeddings, which involves measuring distances between samples in the embedding spaces.Particularly, we find that the memorization scores calculated from layer embeddings of Vision Transformers (ViTs) show an notable trend - the latter (deeper) the layer, the less the memorization measured.It has been found that the memorization scores from the early layers' embeddings are more sensitive to low-level memorization (e.g. colors and simple patterns for an image), while those from the latter layers are more sensitive to high-level memorization (e.g. semantic meaning of an image).We also observe that, for a specific model architecture, its degree of memorization on different levels of information is unique.It can be viewed as an inherent property of the architecture.Building upon this insight, we introduce a unique fingerprinting methodology.This method capitalizes on the unique distributions of the memorization score across different layers of ViTs, providing a novel approach to identifying models involved in generating deepfakes and malicious content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach demonstrates a marked 30% enhancement in identification accuracy over existing baseline methods, offering a more effective tool for combating digital misinformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study explores the emerging area of continual panoptic segmentation, highlighting three key balances.First, we introduce past-class backtrace distillation to balance the stability of existing knowledge with the adaptability to new information.This technique retraces the features associated with past classes based on the final label assignment results, performing knowledge distillation targeting these specific features from the previous model while allowing other features to flexibly adapt to new information.Additionally, we introduce a class-proportional memory strategy, which aligns the class distribution in the replay sample set with that of the historical training data.This strategy maintains a balanced class representation during replay, enhancing the utility of the limited-capacity replay sample set in recalling prior classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, recognizing that replay samples are annotated only for the classes of their original step, we devise balanced anti-misguidance losses, which combat the impact of incomplete annotations without incurring classification bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Building upon these innovations, we present a new method named Balanced Continual Panoptic Segmentation (BalConpas).Our evaluation on the challenging ADE20K dataset demonstrates its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.The official code is available at https://github.com/jinpeng0528/BalConpas.</p>

                  <p>In object detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.However, UDA's reliance on labeled source data restricts its adaptability in privacy-related scenarios.This study focuses on source-free object detection (SFOD), which adapts a source-trained detector to an unlabeled target domain without using labeled source data.Recent advancements in self-training, particularly with the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, show promise for SFOD deployment.However, the absence of source supervision significantly compromises the stability of these approaches.We identify two primary issues, (1) uncontrollable degradation of the teacher model due to inopportune updates from the student model, and (2) the student model's tendency to replicate errors from incorrect pseudo labels, leading to it being trapped in a local optimum.Both factors contribute to a detrimental circular dependency, resulting in rapid performance degradation in recent self-training frameworks.To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dynamic Retraining-Updating (DRU) mechanism, which actively manages the student training and teacher updating processes to achieve co-evolutionary training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Historical Student Loss to mitigate the influence of incorrect pseudo labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SFOD setting on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks, comparable to or even surpassing advanced UDA methods.The code will be released at https://github.com/lbktrinh/DRU</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable advancements in various fields using large, well-annotated datasets.However, real-world data often exhibit long-tailed distributions and label noise, significantly degrading generalization performance.Recent studies addressing these issues have focused on noisy sample selection methods that estimate the centroid of each class based on high-confidence samples within each target class.The performance of these methods is limited because they use only the training samples within each class for class centroid estimation, making the quality of centroids susceptible to long-tailed distributions and noisy labels.In this study, we present a robust training framework called Distribution-aware Sample Selection and Contrastive Learning (DaSC).Specifically, DaSC introduces a Distribution-aware Class Centroid Estimation (DaCC) to generate enhanced class centroids.DaCC performs weighted averaging of the features from all samples, with weights determined based on model predictions.Additionally, we propose a confidence-aware contrastive learning strategy to obtain balanced and robust representations.The training samples are categorized into high-confidence and low-confidence samples.Our method then applies Semi-supervised Balanced Contrastive Loss (SBCL) using high-confidence samples, leveraging reliable label information to mitigate class bias.For the low-confidence samples, our method computes Mixup-enhanced Instance Discrimination Loss (MIDL) to improve their representations in a self-supervised manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results on CIFAR and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DaSC compared to previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised video anomaly detection (UVAD).The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled videos as training data.The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a significant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in the feature space.We refer to this property as the "Anomaly Cluster" issue.The condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal data in the training set.Consequently, training conventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often leads to sub-optimal results.To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new method called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out the Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset.Following the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection capability.Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a significant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed cleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the proposed method on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate that CKNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art UVAD method by up to 8.5% (from 82.0 to 89.0) in terms of AUROC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Moreover, we emphasize that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art method trained using anomaly-free data.</p>

                  <p>Cross-view video geo-localization (CVGL) aims to derive GPS trajectories from street-view videos by aligning them with aerial-view images.Despite their promising performance, current CVGL methods face significant challenges.These methods use camera and odometry data, typically absent in real-world scenarios.They utilize multiple adjacent frames and various encoders for feature extraction, resulting in high computational costs.Moreover, these approaches independently predict each street-view frame's location, resulting in temporally inconsistent GPS trajectories.To address these challenges, in this work, we propose GAReT, a fully transformer-based method for CVGL that does not require camera and odometry data.We introduce GeoAdapter, a transformer-adapter module designed to efficiently aggregate image-level representations and adapt them for video inputs.Specifically, we train a transformer encoder on video frames and aerial images, then freeze the encoder to optimize the GeoAdapter module to obtain video-level representation.To address temporally inconsistent trajectories, we introduce TransRetriever, an encoder-decoder transformer model that predicts GPS locations of street-view frames by encoding top-k nearest neighbor predictions per frame and auto-regressively decoding the best neighbor based on the previous frame's predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method's effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.875</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/manupillai308/GAReT.</p>

Method: We design and apply a systematic method to select two sets of 94 non-IoT and IoT systems software from GitHub with comparable characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compute quality metrics on the systems in these two sets and then analyse and compare the metric values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We analyse in depth and provide specific examples of IoT system's complexity and how it manifests in the codebases.After the comparison, We systematically select and present a list of best practices to address the observed difference between IoT and non-IoT code.   Results: Through a comparison of metrics, we conclude that software for IoT systems is more complex, coupled, larger, less maintainable, and cohesive than non-IoT systems.Several factors, such as integrating multiple hardware and software components and managing data communication between them, contribute to these differences.Considering these differences, we present a revisited best practices list with approaches, tools, or techniques for developing IoT systems.As example, applying modularity, and refactoring are best practices for lowering the complexity.   Conclusion: Based on our work, researchers can now make an informed decision using existing studies on the quality of non-IoT systems for IoT systems.</p>

                  <p>Wearable systems provide continuous health monitoring and can lead to early detection of potential health issues.However, the lifecycle of wearable systems faces several challenges.First, effective model training for new wearable devices requires substantial labeled data from various subjects collected directly by the wearable.Second, subsequent model updates require further extensive labeled data for retraining.Finally, frequent model updating on the wearable device can decrease the battery life in long-term data monitoring.Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we propose MetaWearS, a meta-learning method to reduce the amount of initial data collection required.Moreover, our approach incorporates a prototypical updating mechanism, simplifying the update process by modifying the class prototype rather than retraining the entire model.We explore the performance of MetaWearS in two case studies, namely, the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of atrial fibrillation.We show that by fine-tuning with just a few samples, we achieve 70% and 82% AUC for the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of atrial fibrillation, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a conventional approach, our proposed method performs better with up to 45% AUC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Furthermore, updating the model with only 16 minutes of additional labeled data increases the AUC by up to 5.3%.Finally, MetaWearS reduces the energy consumption for model updates by 456x and 418x for epileptic seizure and AF detection, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a subclass of neuromorphic models that have great potential to be used as controllers in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) due to their energy efficiency.They can benefit from the prevalent approach of first training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and then translating to an SNN with subsequent hyperparameter tuning.The tuning is required to ensure that the resulting SNN is accurate with respect to the ANN in terms of metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).However, SNN controllers for safety-critical CPSs must also satisfy safety specifications, which are not guaranteed by the conversion approach.In this paper, we propose a solution which tunes the $temporal$ $window$ hyperparameter of the translated SNN to ensure both accuracy and compliance with the safe range specification that requires the SNN outputs to remain within a safe range.The core verification problem is modelled using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and is solved with Gurobi.When the controller fails to meet the range specification, we compute tight bounds on the SNN outputs as feedback for the CPS developer.To mitigate the high computational cost of verification, we integrate data-driven steps to minimize verification calls.Our approach provides designers with the confidence to safely integrate energy-efficient SNN controllers into modern CPSs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach with experimental results on five different benchmark neural controllers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference.Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical.To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism.To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs.We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured.For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, comparison between latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.All related contents are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fantastic-data-engineering.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML), driven by prominent paradigms such as centralized and federated learning, has made significant progress in various critical applications ranging from autonomous driving to face recognition.However, its remarkable success has been accompanied by various attacks.Recently, the model hijacking attack has shown that ML models can be hijacked to execute tasks different from their original tasks, which increases both accountability and parasitic computational risks.Nevertheless, thus far, this attack has only focused on centralized learning.In this work, we broaden the scope of this attack to the federated learning domain, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data.Specifically, we present HijackFL, the first-of-its-kind hijacking attack against the global model in federated learning.The adversary aims to force the global model to perform a different task (called hijacking task) from its original task without the server or benign client noticing.To accomplish this, unlike existing methods that use data poisoning to modify the target model's parameters, HijackFL searches for pixel-level perturbations based on their local model (without modifications) to align hijacking samples with the original ones in the feature space.When performing the hijacking task, the adversary applies these cloaks to the hijacking samples, compelling the global model to identify them as original samples and predict them accordingly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three popular models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results demonstrate that its attack performance outperforms baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>We further investigate the factors that affect its performance and discuss possible defenses to mitigate its impact.</p>

                  <p>Mix-up is a key technique for consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, generating strong-perturbed samples for strong-weak pseudo-supervision.Existing mix-up operations are performed either randomly or with predefined rules, such as replacing low-confidence patches with high-confidence ones.The former lacks control over the perturbation degree, leading to overfitting on randomly perturbed samples, while the latter tends to generate images with trivial perturbations, both of which limit the effectiveness of consistency learning.This paper aims to answer the following question: How can image mix-up perturbation be adaptively performed during training?To this end, we propose an Adaptive Mix algorithm (AdaMix) for image mix-up in a self-paced learning manner.Given that, in general, a model's performance gradually improves during training, AdaMix is equipped with a self-paced curriculum that, in the initial training stage, provides relatively simple perturbed samples and then gradually increases the difficulty of perturbed images by adaptively controlling the perturbation degree based on the model's learning state estimated by a self-paced regularize.We develop three frameworks with our AdaMix, i.e., AdaMix-ST, AdaMix-MT, and AdaMix-CT, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets, including both 2D and 3D modalities, show that the proposed frameworks are capable of achieving superior performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, compared with the state-of-the-art, AdaMix-CT achieves relative improvements of 2.62% in Dice and 48.25% in average surface distance on the ACDC dataset with 10% labeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>The results demonstrate that mix-up operations with dynamically adjusted perturbation strength based on the segmentation model's state can significantly enhance the effectiveness of consistency regularization.</p>

                  <p>Fredman proposed in 1976 the following algorithmic problem: Given are a ground set $X$, some partial order $P$ over $X$, and some comparison oracle $O_L$ that specifies a linear order $L$ over $X$ that extends $P$. A query to $O_L$ has as input distinct $x, x' \in X$ and outputs whether $x <_L x'$ or vice versa.If we denote by $e(P)$ the number of linear extensions of $P$, then $\log e(P)$ is a worst-case lower bound on the number of queries needed to output the sorted order of $X$.   Fredman did not specify in what form the partial order is given.Haeupler, Hlad\'ik, Iacono, Rozhon, Tarjan, and T\v{e}tek ('24) propose to assume as input a directed acyclic graph, $G$, with $m$ edges and $n=|X|$ vertices.Denote by $P_G$ the partial order induced by $G$. Algorithmic performance is measured in running time and the number of queries used, where they use $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries to output $X$ in its sorted order.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Their algorithm is worst-case optimal in terms of running time and queries, both. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Their algorithm combines topological sorting with heapsort, and uses sophisticated data structures (including a recent type of heap with a working-set bound).Their analysis relies upon sophisticated counting arguments using entropy, recursively defined sets defined over the run of their algorithm, and vertices in the graph that they identify as bottlenecks for sorting.   In this paper, we do away with sophistication.We show that when the input is a directed acyclic graph then the problem admits a simple solution using $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries.Especially our proofs are much simpler as we avoid the usage of advanced charging arguments and data structures, and instead rely upon two brief observations.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus.</p>

                  <p>Recent approaches have shown that large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP can improve semantic segmentation performance.These methods typically aim for pixel-level vision-language alignment, but often rely on low resolution image features from CLIP, resulting in class ambiguities along boundaries.Moreover, the global scene representations in CLIP text embeddings do not directly correlate with the local and detailed pixel-level features, making meaningful alignment more difficult.To address these limitations, we introduce MTA-CLIP, a novel framework employing mask-level vision-language alignment.Specifically, we first propose Mask-Text Decoder that enhances the mask representations using rich textual data with the CLIP language model.Subsequently, it aligns mask representations with text embeddings using Mask-to-Text Contrastive Learning.Furthermore, we introduce MaskText Prompt Learning, utilizing multiple context-specific prompts for text embeddings to capture diverse class representations across masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, MTA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art, surpassing prior works by an average of 2.8% and 1.3% on on standard benchmark datasets, ADE20k and Cityscapes, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks.However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times.This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing.Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT).From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory.Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detection of malicious behavior in a large network is a challenging problem for machine learning in computer security, since it requires a model with high expressive power and scalable inference.Existing solutions struggle to achieve this feat -- current cybersec-tailored approaches are still limited in expressivity, and methods successful in other domains do not scale well for large volumes of data, rendering frequent retraining impossible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work proposes a new perspective for learning from graph data that is modeling network entity interactions as a large heterogeneous graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>High expressivity of the method is achieved with neural network architecture HMILnet that naturally models this type of data and provides theoretical guarantees.The scalability is achieved by pursuing local graph inference, i.e., classifying individual vertices and their neighborhood as independent samples.Our experiments exhibit improvement over the state-of-the-art Probabilistic Threat Propagation (PTP) algorithm, show a further threefold accuracy improvement when additional data is used, which is not possible with the PTP algorithm, and demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the method to new, previously unseen entities.</p>

                  <p>Neurodegeneration as measured through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recognized as a potential biomarker for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), but is generally considered less specific than amyloid or tau based biomarkers.Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline.Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan.Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy.This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years.We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies).By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution.Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p>

                  <p>Recommender system of the e-commerce platform usually serves multiple business scenarios.Multi-scenario Recommendation (MSR) is an important topic that improves ranking performance by leveraging information from different scenarios.Recent methods for MSR mostly construct scenario shared or specific modules to model commonalities and differences among scenarios.However, when the amount of data among scenarios is skewed or data in some scenarios is extremely sparse, it is difficult to learn scenario-specific parameters well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, simple sharing of information from other scenarios may result in a negative transfer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>In this paper, we propose a unified model named Cross-Scenario Information Interaction (CSII) to serve all scenarios by a mixture of scenario-dominated experts.Specifically, we propose a novel method to select highly transferable features in data instances.Then, we propose an attention-based aggregator module, which can adaptively extract relative knowledge from cross-scenario.Experiments on the production dataset verify the superiority of our method.Online A/B test in Meituan Waimai APP also shows a significant performance gain, leading to an average improvement in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of 1.0% for overall scenarios.</p>

                  <p>In this thesis, we propose an approach to identity resolution across social media platforms using the topics, sentiments, and timings of the posts on the platforms.After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from Disqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the two platforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal approach generally performs better.We found that the temporal window size influences results more than the shifting amount.On the other hand, our sentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little difference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods.We also experimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model, which achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of 2525 in our collected corpus.Future work includes refining sentiment analysis by evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional phases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified rewards.</p>

                  <p>As learning-to-rank models are increasingly deployed for decision-making in areas with profound life implications, the FairML community has been developing fair learning-to-rank (LTR) models.These models rely on the availability of sensitive demographic features such as race or sex.However, in practice, regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns protect this data from collection and use.As a result, practitioners may either need to promote fairness despite the absence of these features or turn to demographic inference tools to attempt to infer them.Given that these tools are fallible, this paper aims to further understand how errors in demographic inference impact the fairness performance of popular fair LTR strategies.In which cases would it be better to keep such demographic attributes hidden from models versus infer them?We examine a spectrum of fair LTR strategies ranging from fair LTR with and without demographic features hidden versus inferred to fairness-unaware LTR followed by fair re-ranking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a controlled empirical investigation modeling different levels of inference errors by systematically perturbing the inferred sensitive attribute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>We also perform three case studies with real-world datasets and popular open-source inference methods.Our findings reveal that as inference noise grows, LTR-based methods that incorporate fairness considerations into the learning process may increase bias.In contrast, fair re-ranking strategies are more robust to inference errors.All source code, data, and experimental artifacts of our experimental study are available here: https://github.com/sewen007/hoiltr.git</p>

                  <p>Multi-task learning (MTL) is an inductive transfer mechanism designed to leverage useful information from multiple tasks to improve generalization performance compared to single-task learning.It has been extensively explored in traditional machine learning to address issues such as data sparsity and overfitting in neural networks.In this work, we apply MTL to problems in science and engineering governed by partial differential equations (PDEs).However, implementing MTL in this context is complex, as it requires task-specific modifications to accommodate various scenarios representing different physical processes.To this end, we present a multi-task deep operator network (MT-DeepONet) to learn solutions across various functional forms of source terms in a PDE and multiple geometries in a single concurrent training session.We introduce modifications in the branch network of the vanilla DeepONet to account for various functional forms of a parameterized coefficient in a PDE.Additionally, we handle parameterized geometries by introducing a binary mask in the branch network and incorporating it into the loss term to improve convergence and generalization to new geometry tasks.Our approach is demonstrated on three benchmark problems: (1) learning different functional forms of the source term in the Fisher equation; (2) learning multiple geometries in a 2D Darcy Flow problem and showcasing better transfer learning capabilities to new geometries; and (3) learning 3D parameterized geometries for a heat transfer problem and demonstrate the ability to predict on new but similar geometries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our MT-DeepONet framework offers a novel approach to solving PDE problems in engineering and science under a unified umbrella based on synergistic learning that reduces the overall training cost for neural operators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pretraining for partial differential equation (PDE) modeling has recently shown promise in scaling neural operators across datasets to improve generalizability and performance.Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks.To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior.We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best.In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations.Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through providing insights into pretraining neural operators for physics prediction, we hope to motivate future work in developing and evaluating pretraining methods for PDEs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the challenge of perceiving complete object shapes through visual perception.While prior studies have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in segmenting the visible parts of objects within a scene, amodal segmentation, in particular, has the potential to allow robots to infer the occluded parts of objects.To this end, this paper introduces a new framework that explores amodal segmentation for robotic grasping in cluttered scenes, thus greatly enhancing robotic grasping abilities.Initially, we use a conventional segmentation algorithm to detect the visible segments of the target object, which provides shape priors for completing the full object mask.Particularly, to explore how to utilize semantic features from RGB images and geometric information from depth images, we propose a Linear-fusion Attention-guided Convolutional Network (LAC-Net).LAC-Net utilizes the linear-fusion strategy to effectively fuse this cross-modal data, and then uses the prior visible mask as attention map to guide the network to focus on target feature locations for further complete mask recovery.Using the amodal mask of the target object provides advantages in selecting more accurate and robust grasp points compared to relying solely on the visible segments.The results on different datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the robot experiments validate the feasibility and robustness of this method in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Our code and demonstrations are available on the project page: https://jrryzh.github.io/LAC-Net.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Earth system science have been marked by the exponential increase in the availability of diverse, multivariate datasets characterised by moderate to high spatio-temporal resolutions.Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) have emerged as one suitable solution for transforming this flood of data into a simple yet robust data structure.ESDCs achieve this by organising data into an analysis-ready format aligned with a spatio-temporal grid, facilitating user-friendly analysis and diminishing the need for extensive technical data processing knowledge.Despite these significant benefits, the completion of the entire ESDC life cycle remains a challenging task.Obstacles are not only of a technical nature but also relate to domain-specific problems in Earth system research.There exist barriers to realising the full potential of data collections in light of novel cloud-based technologies, particularly in curating data tailored for specific application domains.These include transforming data to conform to a spatio-temporal grid with minimum distortions and managing complexities such as spatio-temporal autocorrelation issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing these challenges is pivotal for the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span>Furthermore, adhering to open science principles for data dissemination, reproducibility, visualisation, and reuse is crucial for fostering sustainable research.Overcoming these challenges offers a substantial opportunity to advance data-driven Earth system research, unlocking the full potential of an integrated, multidimensional view of Earth system processes.This is particularly true when such research is coupled with innovative research paradigms and technological progress.</p>

                  <p>Representation-based retrieval models, so-called biencoders, estimate the relevance of a document to a query by calculating the similarity of their respective embeddings.Current state-of-the-art biencoders are trained using an expensive training regime involving knowledge distillation from a teacher model and batch-sampling.Instead of relying on a teacher model, we contribute a novel parameter-free loss function for self-supervision that exploits the pre-trained language modeling capabilities of the encoder model as a training signal, eliminating the need for batch sampling by performing implicit hard negative mining.We investigate the capabilities of our proposed approach through extensive ablation studies, demonstrating that self-distillation can match the effectiveness of teacher distillation using only 13.5% of the data, while offering a speedup in training time between 3x and 15x compared to parametrized losses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data is made openly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to sequentially learn new classes, while maintaining the capability to locate and identify old ones.As the training data arrives with annotations only with new classes, IOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting.Prior methodologies mainly tackle the forgetting issue through knowledge distillation and exemplar replay, ignoring the conflict between limited model capacity and increasing knowledge.In this paper, we explore \textit{dynamic object queries} for incremental object detection built on Transformer architecture.We propose the \textbf{Dy}namic object \textbf{Q}uery-based \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer (DyQ-DETR), which incrementally expands the model representation ability to achieve stability-plasticity tradeoff.First, a new set of learnable object queries are fed into the decoder to represent new classes.These new object queries are aggregated with those from previous phases to adapt both old and new knowledge well.Second, we propose the isolated bipartite matching for object queries in different phases, based on disentangled self-attention.The interaction among the object queries at different phases is eliminated to reduce inter-class confusion.Thanks to the separate supervision and computation over object queries, we further present the risk-balanced partial calibration for effective exemplar replay.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyQ-DETR significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, with limited parameter overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>
