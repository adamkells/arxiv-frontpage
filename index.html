                  <p>The sparse dictionary coding framework represents signals as a linear combination of a few predefined dictionary atoms.It has been employed for images, time series, graph signals and recently for 2-way (or 2D) spatio-temporal data employing jointly temporal and spatial dictionaries.Large and over-complete dictionaries enable high-quality models, but also pose scalability challenges which are exacerbated in multi-dictionary settings.Hence, an important problem that we address in this paper is: How to scale multi-dictionary coding for large dictionaries and datasets?   We propose a multi-dictionary atom selection technique for low-rank sparse coding named LRMDS.To enable scalability to large dictionaries and datasets, it progressively selects groups of row-column atom pairs based on their alignment with the data and performs convex relaxation coding via the corresponding sub-dictionaries.We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that when the data has a low-rank encoding with a sparse subset of the atoms, LRMDS is able to select them with strong guarantees under mild assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and quality of LRMDS in both synthetic and real-world datasets and for a range of coding dictionaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>It achieves 3X to 10X speed-up compared to baselines, while obtaining up to two orders of magnitude improvement in representation quality on some of the real world datasets given a fixed target number of atoms.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks and enabling widespread real-world applications.However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating content that either conflicts with established knowledge or is unfaithful to the original sources.Existing hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on sentence- or passage-level hallucination detection, neglecting dialogue-level evaluation, hallucination localization, and rationale provision.They also predominantly target factuality hallucinations while underestimating faithfulness hallucinations, often relying on labor-intensive or non-specialized evaluators.To address these limitations, we propose HalluDial, the first comprehensive large-scale benchmark for automatic dialogue-level hallucination evaluation.HalluDial encompasses both spontaneous and induced hallucination scenarios, covering factuality and faithfulness hallucinations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark includes 4,094 dialogues with a total of 146,856 samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Leveraging HalluDial, we conduct a comprehensive meta-evaluation of LLMs' hallucination evaluation capabilities in information-seeking dialogues and introduce a specialized judge language model, HalluJudge.The high data quality of HalluDial enables HalluJudge to achieve superior or competitive performance in hallucination evaluation, facilitating the automatic assessment of dialogue-level hallucinations in LLMs and providing valuable insights into this phenomenon.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and the code are available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/HalluDial. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we propose a two-stage sign language production (SLP) paradigm that first encodes sign language sequences into discrete codes and then autoregressively generates sign language from text based on the learned codebook.However, existing vector quantization (VQ) methods are fixed-length encodings, overlooking the uneven information density in sign language, which leads to under-encoding of important regions and over-encoding of unimportant regions.To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic vector quantization (DVA-VAE) model that can dynamically adjust the encoding length based on the information density in sign language to achieve accurate and compact encoding.Then, a GPT-like model learns to generate code sequences and their corresponding durations from spoken language text.Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To promote sign language research, we propose a new large German sign language dataset, PHOENIX-News, which contains 486 hours of sign language videos, audio, and transcription texts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.941</span></span>Experimental analysis on PHOENIX-News shows that the performance of our model can be further improved by increasing the size of the training data.Our project homepage is https://t2sgpt-demo.yinaoxiong.cn.</p>

                  <p>Pioneering advancements in large language model-powered agents have underscored the design pattern of multi-agent collaboration, demonstrating that collective intelligence can surpass the capabilities of each individual.Inspired by the neural scaling law, which posits that increasing neurons leads to emergent abilities, this study investigates whether a similar principle applies to increasing agents in multi-agent collaboration.Technically, we propose multi-agent collaboration networks (MacNet), which utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents and streamline their interactive reasoning via topological ordering, with solutions derived from their dialogues.Extensive experiments show that MacNet consistently outperforms baseline models, enabling effective agent collaboration across various network topologies and supporting cooperation among more than a thousand agents.Notably, we observed a small-world collaboration phenomenon, where topologies resembling small-world properties achieved superior performance.Additionally, we identified a collaborative scaling law, indicating that normalized solution quality follows a logistic growth pattern as scaling agents, with collaborative emergence occurring much earlier than previously observed instances of neural emergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic methods for generating and gathering linguistic data have proven effective for fine-tuning Language Models (LMs) in languages less resourced than English.Still, while there has been emphasis on data quantity, less attention has been given to its quality.In this work, we investigate the impact of human intervention on machine-generated data when fine-tuning dialogical models.In particular, we study (1) whether post-edited dialogues exhibit higher perceived quality compared to the originals that were automatically generated; (2) whether fine-tuning with post-edited dialogues results in noticeable differences in the generated outputs; and (3) whether post-edited dialogues influence the outcomes when considering the parameter size of the LMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end we created HED-IT, a large-scale dataset where machine-generated dialogues are paired with the version post-edited by humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>Using both the edited and unedited portions of HED-IT, we fine-tuned three different sizes of an LM.Results from both human and automatic evaluation show that the different quality of training data is clearly perceived and it has an impact also on the models trained on such data.Additionally, our findings indicate that larger models are less sensitive to data quality, whereas this has a crucial impact on smaller models.These results enhance our comprehension of the impact of human intervention on training data in the development of high-quality LMs.</p>

                  <p>Modern alignment techniques based on human preferences, such as RLHF and DPO, typically employ divergence regularization relative to the reference model to ensure training stability.However, this often limits the flexibility of models during alignment, especially when there is a clear distributional discrepancy between the preference data and the reference model.In this paper, we focus on the alignment of recent text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and find that this "reference mismatch" is indeed a significant problem in aligning these models due to the unstructured nature of visual modalities: e.g., a preference for a particular stylistic aspect can easily induce such a discrepancy.Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel and memory-friendly preference alignment method for diffusion models that does not depend on any reference model, coined margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO).MaPO jointly maximizes the likelihood margin between the preferred and dispreferred image sets and the likelihood of the preferred sets, simultaneously learning general stylistic features and preferences.For evaluation, we introduce two new pairwise preference datasets, which comprise self-generated image pairs from SDXL, Pick-Style and Pick-Safety, simulating diverse scenarios of reference mismatch.Our experiments validate that MaPO can significantly improve alignment on Pick-Style and Pick-Safety and general preference alignment when used with Pick-a-Pic v2, surpassing the base SDXL and other existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, models, and datasets are publicly available via https://mapo-t2i.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span></p>

                  <p>Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analysis on satellite images using deep learning-based methods is significantly helpful in understanding the geography, socio-economic conditions, poverty levels, and urban sprawl in developing countries.Recent works involve segmentation with LULC classes such as farmland, built-up areas, forests, meadows, water bodies, etc.Training deep learning methods on satellite images requires large sets of images annotated with LULC classes.However, annotated data for developing countries are scarce due to a lack of funding, absence of dedicated residential/industrial/economic zones, a large population, and diverse building materials.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>BD-SAT provides a high-resolution dataset that includes pixel-by-pixel LULC annotations for Dhaka metropolitan city and surrounding rural/urban areas. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span>Using a strict and standardized procedure, the ground truth is created using Bing satellite imagery with a ground spatial distance of 2.22 meters per pixel.A three-stage, well-defined annotation process has been followed with support from GIS experts to ensure the reliability of the annotations.We performed several experiments to establish benchmark results.The results show that the annotated BD-SAT is sufficient to train large deep learning models with adequate accuracy for five major LULC classes: forest, farmland, built-up areas, water bodies, and meadows.</p>

                  <p>In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner.However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community.For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route.Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.   To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 10000 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations.We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions.</p>

                  <p>Distributed tracing serves as a fundamental element in the monitoring of cloud-based and datacenter systems.It provides visibility into the full lifecycle of a request or operation across multiple services, which is essential for understanding system dependencies and performance bottlenecks.To mitigate computational and storage overheads, most tracing frameworks adopt a uniform sampling strategy, which inevitably captures overlapping and redundant information.More advanced methods employ learning-based approaches to bias the sampling toward more informative traces.However, existing methods fall short of considering the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of trace data, which is essential for the production deployment of trace sampling.To address these practical challenges, in this paper we present TraceMesh, a scalable and streaming sampler for distributed traces.TraceMesh employs Locality-Sensitivity Hashing (LSH) to improve sampling efficiency by projecting traces into a low-dimensional space while preserving their similarity.In this process, TraceMesh accommodates previously unseen trace features in a unified and streamlined way.Subsequently, TraceMesh samples traces through evolving clustering, which dynamically adjusts the sampling decision to avoid over-sampling of recurring traces.The proposed method is evaluated with trace data collected from both open-source microservice benchmarks and production service systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that TraceMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in both sampling accuracy and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common.It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries.In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score.Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only.In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's.In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation.We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not.Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID.Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.</p>

                  <p>This article introduces a novel method for converting 3D voxel maps, commonly utilized by robots for localization and navigation, into 2D occupancy maps that can be used for more computationally efficient large-scale navigation, both in the sense of computation time and memory usage.The main aim is to effectively integrate the distinct mapping advantages of 2D and 3D maps to enable efficient path planning for both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs).The proposed method uses the free space representation in the UFOMap mapping solution to generate 2D occupancy maps with height and slope information.In the process of 3D to 2D map conversion, the proposed method conducts safety checks and eliminates free spaces in the map with dimensions (in the height axis) lower than the robot's safety margins.This allows an aerial or ground robot to navigate safely, relying primarily on the 2D map generated by the method.Additionally, the method extracts height and slope data from the 3D voxel map.The slope data identifies areas too steep for a ground robot to traverse, marking them as occupied, thus enabling a more accurate representation of the terrain for ground robots.The height data is utilized to convert paths generated using the 2D map into paths in 3D space for both UAVs and UGVs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in two different environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>The quality of datasets plays an increasingly crucial role in the research and development of modern artificial intelligence (AI).Despite the proliferation of open dataset platforms nowadays, data quality issues, such as insufficient documentation, inaccurate annotations, and ethical concerns, remain common in datasets widely used in AI.Furthermore, these issues are often subtle and difficult to be detected by rule-based scripts, requiring expensive manual identification and verification by dataset users or maintainers.With the increasing capability of large language models (LLMs), it is promising to streamline the curation of datasets with LLM agents.In this work, as the initial step towards this goal, we propose a dataset curation agent benchmark, DCA-Bench, to measure LLM agents' capability of detecting hidden dataset quality issues.Specifically, we collect diverse real-world dataset quality issues from eight open dataset platforms as a testbed.Additionally, to establish an automatic pipeline for evaluating the success of LLM agents, which requires a nuanced understanding of the agent outputs, we implement a dedicated Evaluator using another LLM agent.We demonstrate that the LLM-based Evaluator empirically aligns well with human evaluation, allowing reliable automatic evaluation on the proposed benchmark.We further conduct experiments on several baseline LLM agents on the proposed benchmark and demonstrate the complexity of the task, indicating that applying LLMs to real-world dataset curation still requires further in-depth exploration and innovation.Finally, the proposed benchmark can also serve as a testbed for measuring the capability of LLMs in problem discovery rather than just problem-solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark suite is available at \url{https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab/dca-bench}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Exploring proper way to conduct multi-speech feature fusion for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition is crucial as different speech features could provide complementary cues reflecting human emotion status.While most previous approaches only extract a single speech feature for emotion recognition, existing fusion methods such as concatenation, parallel connection, and splicing ignore heterogeneous patterns in the interaction between features and features, resulting in performance of existing systems.In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fusion method to explicitly model the relationships between every pair of speech features.Specifically, we propose a multi-dimensional edge features learning strategy called Graph-based multi-Feature fusion method for speech emotion recognition.It represents each speech feature as a node and learns multi-dimensional edge features to explicitly describe the relationship between each feature-feature pair in the context of emotion recognition.This way, the learned multi-dimensional edge features encode speech feature-level information from both the vertex and edge dimensions.Our Approach consists of three modules: an Audio Feature Generation(AFG)module, an Audio-Feature Multi-dimensional Edge Feature(AMEF) module and a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) module.The proposed methodology yielded satisfactory outcomes on the SEWA dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the method demonstrated enhanced performance compared to the baseline in the AVEC 2019 Workshop and Challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>We used data from two cultures as our training and validation sets: two cultures containing German and Hungarian on the SEWA dataset, the CCC scores for German are improved by 17.28% for arousal and 7.93% for liking.The outcomes of our methodology demonstrate a 13% improvement over alternative fusion techniques, including those employing one dimensional edge-based feature fusion approach.</p>

                  <p>In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, existing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches tend to focus on autoregressive formulations and overlook the information within exogenous indicators.To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy.It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB).Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB.We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.</p>

                  <p>Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods principally deploy the ImageNet-1K dataset for model initialization, which inevitably results in sub-optimal situations due to the large domain gap.One of the key challenges is that building large-scale person Re-ID datasets is time-consuming.Some previous efforts address this problem by collecting person images from the internet e.g., LUPerson, but it struggles to learn from unlabeled, uncontrollable, and noisy data.In this paper, we present a novel paradigm Diffusion-ReID to efficiently augment and generate diverse images based on known identities without requiring any cost of data collection and annotation.Technically, this paradigm unfolds in two stages: generation and filtering.During the generation stage, we propose Language Prompts Enhancement (LPE) to ensure the ID consistency between the input image sequence and the generated images.In the diffusion process, we propose a Diversity Injection (DI) module to increase attribute diversity.In order to make the generated data have higher quality, we apply a Re-ID confidence threshold filter to further remove the low-quality images.Benefiting from our proposed paradigm, we first create a new large-scale person Re-ID dataset Diff-Person, which consists of over 777K images from 5,183 identities.Next, we build a stronger person Re-ID backbone pre-trained on our Diff-Person.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on four person Re-ID benchmarks in six widely used settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Compared with other pre-training and self-supervised competitors, our approach shows significant superiority.</p>

                  <p>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), induced by diabetes, poses a significant risk of visual impairment.Accurate and effective grading of DR aids in the treatment of this condition.Yet existing models experience notable performance degradation on unseen domains due to domain shifts.Previous methods address this issue by simulating domain style through simple visual transformation and mitigating domain noise via learning robust representations.However, domain shifts encompass more than image styles.They overlook biases caused by implicit factors such as ethnicity, age, and diagnostic criteria.In our work, we propose a novel framework where representations of paired data from different domains are decoupled into semantic features and domain noise.The resulting augmented representation comprises original retinal semantics and domain noise from other domains, aiming to generate enhanced representations aligned with real-world clinical needs, incorporating rich information from diverse domains.Subsequently, to improve the robustness of the decoupled representations, class and domain prototypes are employed to interpolate the disentangled representations while data-aware weights are designed to focus on rare classes and domains.Finally, we devise a robust pixel-level semantic alignment loss to align retinal semantics decoupled from features, maintaining a balance between intra-class diversity and dense class features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on unseen domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>The code implementations are accessible on https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/DECO.</p>

                  <p>Text-guided video prediction (TVP) involves predicting the motion of future frames from the initial frame according to an instruction, which has wide applications in virtual reality, robotics, and content creation.Previous TVP methods make significant breakthroughs by adapting Stable Diffusion for this task.However, they struggle with frame consistency and temporal stability primarily due to the limited scale of video datasets.We observe that pretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good priors for video dynamics but they lack textual control.Hence, transferring Image2Video models to leverage their video dynamic priors while injecting instruction control to generate controllable videos is both a meaningful and challenging task.To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to predict future video states based on initial frames and text instructions.More specifically, we design a dual query transformer (DQFormer) architecture, which integrates the instructions and frames into the conditional embeddings for future frame prediction.Additionally, we develop Long-Short Term Temporal Adapters and Spatial Adapters that can quickly transfer general video diffusion models to specific scenarios with minimal training costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets: Something Something V2, Epic Kitchen-100, Bridge Data, and UCF-101. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Notably, AID achieves 91.2% and 55.5% FVD improvements on Bridge and SSv2 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.More examples can be found at our website https://chenhsing.github.io/AID.</p>

                  <p>Realtime finite element modeling of bridges assists modern structural health monitoring systems by providing comprehensive insights into structural integrity.This capability is essential for ensuring the safe operation of bridges and preventing sudden catastrophic failures.However, FEM computational cost and the need for realtime analysis pose significant challenges.Additionally, the input data is a 7 dimensional vector, while the output is a 1017 dimensional vector, making accurate and efficient analysis particularly difficult.In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum classical Multilayer Perceptron pipeline leveraging Symmetric Positive Definite matrices and Riemannian manifolds for effective data representation.To maintain the integrity of the qubit structure, we utilize SPD matrices, ensuring data representation is well aligned with the quantum computational framework.Additionally, the method leverages polynomial feature expansion to capture nonlinear relationships within the data.The proposed pipeline combines classical fully connected neural network layers with quantum circuit layers to enhance model performance and efficiency.Our experiments focused on various configurations of such hybrid models to identify the optimal structure for accurate and efficient realtime analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The best performing model achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.00031, significantly outperforming traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>The task of detecting moral values in text has significant implications in various fields, including natural language processing, social sciences, and ethical decision-making.Previously proposed supervised models often suffer from overfitting, leading to hyper-specialized moral classifiers that struggle to perform well on data from different domains.To address this issue, we introduce novel systems that leverage abstract concepts and common-sense knowledge acquired from Large Language Models and Natural Language Inference models during previous stages of training on multiple data sources.By doing so, we aim to develop versatile and robust methods for detecting moral values in real-world scenarios.Our approach uses the GPT 3.5 model as a zero-shot ready-made unsupervised multi-label classifier for moral values detection, eliminating the need for explicit training on labeled data.We compare it with a smaller NLI-based zero-shot model.The results show that the NLI approach achieves competitive results compared to the Davinci model.Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the performance of supervised systems in the context of cross-domain multi-label moral value detection.This involves training supervised models on different domains to explore their effectiveness in handling data from different sources and comparing their performance with the unsupervised methods.Our contributions encompass a thorough analysis of both supervised and unsupervised methodologies for cross-domain value detection.We introduce the Davinci model as a state-of-the-art zero-shot unsupervised moral values classifier, pushing the boundaries of moral value detection without the need for explicit training on labeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we perform a comparative evaluation of our approach with the supervised models, shedding light on their respective strengths and weaknesses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

We show FAULT+PROBE may be used to circumvent the verify-after-sign fault check mechanism, which is designed to prevent the generation of erroneous signatures that leak sensitive information.It does so by injecting directional faults into key positions identified during a memory profiling stage.The attacker observes the signature generation rate and decodes the secret bit value accordingly.This circumvention is enabled by an observable channel in the victim.FAULT+PROBE is not limited to signing victims and can be used to probe secret bits on arbitrary systems where an observable channel is present that leaks the result of the fault injection attempt.To demonstrate the attack, we target the fault-protected ECDSA in wolfSSL's implementation of the TLS 1.3 handshake.We recover 256-bit session keys with an average recovery rate of 22 key bits/hour and a 100% success rate.</p>

                  <p>Text classification is a crucial task encountered frequently in practical scenarios, yet it is still under-explored in the era of large language models (LLMs).This study shows that LLMs are vulnerable to changes in the number and arrangement of options in text classification.Our extensive empirical analyses reveal that the key bottleneck arises from ambiguous decision boundaries and inherent biases towards specific tokens and positions.To mitigate these issues, we make the first attempt and propose a novel two-stage classification framework for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is grounded in the empirical observation that pairwise comparisons can effectively alleviate boundary ambiguity and inherent bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>Specifically, we begin with a self-reduction technique to efficiently narrow down numerous options, which contributes to reduced decision space and a faster comparison process.Subsequently, pairwise contrastive comparisons are employed in a chain-of-thought manner to draw out nuances and distinguish confusable options, thus refining the ambiguous decision boundary.Extensive experiments on four datasets (Banking77, HWU64, LIU54, and Clinic150) verify the effectiveness of our framework.Furthermore, benefitting from our framework, various LLMs can achieve consistent improvements.Our code and data are available in \url{https://github.com/Chuge0335/PC-CoT}.</p>

                  <p>Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common.It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries.In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score.Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation.We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not.Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated.Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures.We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID.Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.</p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the performance of source-domain pretrained models when tested on unknown shifted target domains.Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data.Recently, diffusion-driven TTA methods have demonstrated strong performance by using an unconditional diffusion model, which is also trained on the source domain to transform target data into synthetic data as a source domain projection.This allows the source model to make predictions without weight adaptation.In this paper, we argue that the domains of the source model and the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA methods are not aligned.To adapt the source model to the synthetic domain of the unconditional diffusion model, we introduce a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data.Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset.Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process mitigates the potential domain gap between the conditional and unconditional models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Diffusion-Driven-Test-Time-Adaptation-via-Synthetic-Domain-Alignment.</p>

                  <p>Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is to identify a wireless device from its uniqueness of the analog circuitry or hardware imperfections.However, unlike the MAC address which can be modified, such hardware feature is inevitable for the signal emitted to air, which can possibly reveal device whereabouts, e.g., a sniffer can use a pre-trained model to identify a nearby device when receiving its signal.Such fingerprint may expose critical private information, e.g., the associated upper-layer applications or the end-user.In this paper, we propose to erase such RF feature for wireless devices, which can prevent fingerprinting by actively perturbation from the signal perspective.Specifically, we consider a common RF fingerprinting scenario, where machine learning models are trained from pilot signal data for identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel adversarial attack solution is designed to generate proper perturbations, whereby the perturbed pilot signal can hide the hardware feature and misclassify the model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>We theoretically show that the perturbation would not affect the communication function within a tolerable perturbation threshold.We also implement the pilot signal fingerprinting and the proposed perturbation process in a practical LTE system.Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the RF fingerprints can be effectively erased to protect the user privacy.</p>

                  <p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable.In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability.Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage.Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting.These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations.They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces \emph{VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction)}, a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks.We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments.In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.</p>

We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms.In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem.For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.</p>

                  <p>The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities.In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest.However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.539</span></span>In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation.In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration.We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data.We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty.A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid.Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a Finite Element Method-based calibration.Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time.This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.</p>

                  <p>The translation of gender-neutral person-referring terms (e.g., the students) is often non-trivial.Translating from English into German poses an interesting case -- in German, person-referring nouns are usually gender-specific, and if the gender of the referent(s) is unknown or diverse, the generic masculine (die Studenten (m.)) is commonly used.This solution, however, reduces the visibility of other genders, such as women and non-binary people.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To counteract gender discrimination, a societal movement towards using gender-fair language exists (e.g., by adopting neosystems). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>However, gender-fair German is currently barely supported in machine translation (MT), requiring post-editing or manual translations.We address this research gap by studying gender-fair language in English-to-German MT.Concretely, we enrich a community-created gender-fair language dictionary and sample multi-sentence test instances from encyclopedic text and parliamentary speeches.Using these novel resources, we conduct the first benchmark study involving two commercial systems and six neural MT models for translating words in isolation and natural contexts across two domains.Our findings show that most systems produce mainly masculine forms and rarely gender-neutral variants, highlighting the need for future research.We release code and data at https://github.com/g8a9/building-bridges-gender-fair-german-mt.</p>

                  <p>In recent years there has been a tremendous surge in the general capabilities of AI systems, mainly fuelled by training foundation models on internetscale data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, the creation of openended, ever self-improving AI remains elusive. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this position paper, we argue that the ingredients are now in place to achieve openendedness in AI systems with respect to a human observer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we claim that such open-endedness is an essential property of any artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We begin by providing a concrete formal definition of open-endedness through the lens of novelty and learnability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then illustrate a path towards ASI via open-ended systems built on top of foundation models, capable of making novel, humanrelevant discoveries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude by examining the safety implications of generally-capable openended AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>We expect that open-ended foundation models will prove to be an increasingly fertile and safety-critical area of research in the near future.</p>
