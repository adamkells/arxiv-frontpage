                  <p>Simulating soil reflectance spectra is invaluable for soil-plant radiative modeling and training machine learning models, yet it is difficult as the intricate relationships between soil structure and its constituents.To address this, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra based on soil property inputs was developed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The model is trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property pairs from 17 datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.889</span></span>It generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format.The generative model can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties.SOGM is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the full visible-near-infrared range (VIS-NIR; 400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM.The SOGM was up-scaled by coupling with the Helios 3D plant modeling software, which allowed for generation of synthetic aerial images of simulated soil and plant scenes.It can also be easily integrated with soil-plant radiation model used for remote sensin research like PROSAIL.The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets that not included in model training proved that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs.The presented models are openly accessible on: https://github.com/GEMINI-Breeding/SOGM_soil_spectra_simulation.</p>

                  <p>Temporally localizing the presence of object states in videos is crucial in understanding human activities beyond actions and objects.This task has suffered from a lack of training data due to object states' inherent ambiguity and variety.To avoid exhaustive annotation, learning from transcribed narrations in instructional videos would be intriguing.However, object states are less described in narrations compared to actions, making them less effective.In this work, we propose to extract the object state information from action information included in narrations, using large language models (LLMs).Our observation is that LLMs include world knowledge on the relationship between actions and their resulting object states, and can infer the presence of object states from past action sequences.The proposed LLM-based framework offers flexibility to generate plausible pseudo-object state labels against arbitrary categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method with our newly collected Multiple Object States Transition (MOST) dataset including dense temporal annotation of 60 object state categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Our model trained by the generated pseudo-labels demonstrates significant improvement of over 29% in mAP against strong zero-shot vision-language models, showing the effectiveness of explicitly extracting object state information from actions through LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent works in hand-object reconstruction mainly focus on the single-view and dense multi-view settings.On the one hand, single-view methods can leverage learned shape priors to generalise to unseen objects but are prone to inaccuracies due to occlusions.On the other hand, dense multi-view methods are very accurate but cannot easily adapt to unseen objects without further data collection.In contrast, sparse multi-view methods can take advantage of the additional views to tackle occlusion, while keeping the computational cost low compared to dense multi-view methods.In this paper, we consider the problem of hand-object reconstruction with unseen objects in the sparse multi-view setting.Given multiple RGB images of the hand and object captured at the same time, our model SVHO combines the predictions from each view into a unified reconstruction without optimisation across views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train our model on a synthetic hand-object dataset and evaluate directly on a real world recorded hand-object dataset with unseen objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>We show that while reconstruction of unseen hands and objects from RGB is challenging, additional views can help improve the reconstruction quality.</p>

                  <p>The recent years have witnessed a great array of large multimodal models (LMMs) to effectively solve single-image vision language tasks.However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved.The existing multi-image LMMs (e.g. OpenFlamingo, Emu, Idefics, etc) mostly gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from web, which is neither efficient nor effective.In this paper, we aim at building strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K instances from 14 multi-image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span>We design Mantis-Instruct to cover different multi-image skills like co-reference, reasoning, comparing, temporal understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We combine Mantis-Instruct with several single-image visual-language datasets to train our model Mantis to handle any interleaved image-text inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>We evaluate the trained Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and eight single-image benchmarks.Though only requiring academic-level resources (i.e. 36 hours on 16xA100-40G), Mantis-8B can achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the multi-image benchmarks and beats the existing best multi-image LMM Idefics2-8B by an average of 9 absolute points.We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out evaluation benchmarks.We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis can maintain a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2.Our results are particularly encouraging as it shows that low-cost instruction tuning is indeed much more effective than intensive pre-training in terms of building multi-image LMMs.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions.A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data.In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language.By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models.Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span></p>

Focusing on the image domain of interior scenes, we introduce an improved diffusion model for RGB$\rightarrow$X, which also estimates lighting, as well as the first diffusion X$\rightarrow$RGB model capable of synthesizing realistic images from (full or partial) intrinsic channels.Our X$\rightarrow$RGB model explores a middle ground between traditional rendering and generative models: we can specify only certain appearance properties that should be followed, and give freedom to the model to hallucinate a plausible version of the rest.   This flexibility makes it possible to use a mix of heterogeneous training datasets, which differ in the available channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use multiple existing datasets and extend them with our own synthetic and real data, resulting in a model capable of extracting scene properties better than previous work and of generating highly realistic images of interior scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rising prevalence of deepfakes, there is a growing interest in developing generalizable detection methods for various types of deepfakes.While effective in their specific modalities, traditional detection methods fall short in addressing the generalizability of detection across diverse cross-modal deepfakes.This paper aims to explicitly learn potential cross-modal correlation to enhance deepfake detection towards various generation scenarios.Our approach introduces a correlation distillation task, which models the inherent cross-modal correlation based on content information.This strategy helps to prevent the model from overfitting merely to audio-visual synchronization.Additionally, we present the Cross-Modal Deepfake Dataset (CMDFD), a comprehensive dataset with four generation methods to evaluate the detection of diverse cross-modal deepfakes.The experimental results on CMDFD and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superior generalizability of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data can be found at \url{https://github.com/ljj898/CMDFD-Dataset-and-Deepfake-Detection}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cued Speech (CS) is an advanced visual phonetic encoding system that integrates lip reading with hand codings, enabling people with hearing impairments to communicate efficiently.CS video generation aims to produce specific lip and gesture movements of CS from audio or text inputs.The main challenge is that given limited CS data, we strive to simultaneously generate fine-grained hand and finger movements, as well as lip movements, meanwhile the two kinds of movements need to be asynchronously aligned.Existing CS generation methods are fragile and prone to poor performance due to template-based statistical models and careful hand-crafted pre-processing to fit the models.Therefore, we propose a novel Gloss-prompted Diffusion-based CS Gesture generation framework (called GlossDiff).Specifically, to integrate additional linguistic rules knowledge into the model.we first introduce a bridging instruction called \textbf{Gloss}, which is an automatically generated descriptive text to establish a direct and more delicate semantic connection between spoken language and CS gestures.Moreover, we first suggest rhythm is an important paralinguistic feature for CS to improve the communication efficacy.Therefore, we propose a novel Audio-driven Rhythmic Module (ARM) to learn rhythm that matches audio speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, in this work, we design, record, and publish the first Chinese CS dataset with four CS cuers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.946</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.We release the code and data at https://glossdiff.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Approximate k-Nearest Neighbour (ANN) methods are often used for mining information and aiding machine learning on large scale high-dimensional datasets.ANN methods typically differ in the index structure used for accelerating searches, resulting in various recall/runtime trade-off points.For applications with static datasets, runtime constraints and dataset properties can be used to empirically select an ANN method with suitable operating characteristics.However, for applications with dynamic datasets, which are subject to frequent online changes (like addition of new samples), there is currently no consensus as to which ANN methods are most suitable.Traditional evaluation approaches do not consider the computational costs of updating the index structure, as well as the frequency and size of index updates.To address this, we empirically evaluate 5 popular ANN methods on two main applications (online data collection and online feature learning) while taking into account these considerations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two dynamic datasets are used, derived from the SIFT1M dataset with 1 million samples and the DEEP1B dataset with 1 billion samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>The results indicate that the often used k-d trees method is not suitable on dynamic datasets as it is slower than a straightforward baseline exhaustive search method.For online data collection, the Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs method achieves a consistent speedup over baseline across a wide range of recall rates.For online feature learning, the Scalable Nearest Neighbours method is faster than baseline for recall rates below 75%.</p>

                  <p>Working with cognate data involves handling synonyms, that is, multiple words that describe the same concept in a language.In the early days of language phylogenetics it was recommended to select one synonym only.However, as we show here, binary character matrices, which are used as input for computational methods, do allow for representing the entire dataset including all synonyms.Here we address the question how one can and if one should include all synonyms or whether it is preferable to select synonyms a priori.To this end, we perform maximum likelihood tree inferences with the widely used RAxML-NG tool and show that it yields plausible trees when all synonyms are used as input.Furthermore, we show that a priori synonym selection can yield topologically substantially different trees and we therefore advise against doing so.To represent cognate data including all synonyms, we introduce two types of character matrices beyond the standard binary ones: probabilistic binary and probabilistic multi-valued character matrices.We further show that it is dataset-dependent for which character matrix type the inferred RAxML-NG tree is topologically closest to the gold standard.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also make available a Python interface for generating all of the above character matrix types for cognate data provided in CLDF format. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promising results in learning a task-specific policy from a fixed dataset.However, successful offline RL often relies heavily on the coverage and quality of the given dataset.In scenarios where the dataset for a specific task is limited, a natural approach is to improve offline RL with datasets from other tasks, namely, to conduct Multi-Task Data Sharing (MTDS).Nevertheless, directly sharing datasets from other tasks exacerbates the distribution shift in offline RL.In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based MTDS approach that shares the entire dataset without data selection.Given ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, we perform pessimistic value iteration on the shared offline dataset, which provides a unified framework for single- and multi-task offline RL.We further provide theoretical analysis, which shows that the optimality gap of our method is only related to the expected data coverage of the shared dataset, thus resolving the distribution shift issue in data sharing.Empirically, we release an MTDS benchmark and collect datasets from three challenging domains.The experimental results show our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in challenging MTDS problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>See https://github.com/Baichenjia/UTDS for the datasets and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.935</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>

                  <p>Recent research in dialogue systems and corpora has focused on two main categories: task-oriented (TOD) and open-domain (chit-chat) dialogues.TOD systems help users accomplish specific tasks, while open-domain systems aim to create engaging conversations.However, in real-world scenarios, user intents are often revealed during interactions.A recent study introduced SalesBot, which simulates dialogues transitioning from chit-chat to task-oriented scenarios to train sales agents.Unfortunately, the initial data lacked smooth transitions and coherent long-turn dialogues, resulting in poor naturalness in sales-customer interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, this paper presents SalesBot 2.0, an improved dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>It leverages commonsense knowledge from large language models (LLMs) through strategic prompting.Additionally, we introduce a novel model called SalesAgent, trained on salesperson's interactions, using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.This model excels in transitioning topics, understanding user intents, and selecting appropriate strategies.Experiments using diverse user simulations validate the effectiveness of our method in controlling dialogue strategies in LLMs.Furthermore, SalesBot 2.0 enhances coherence and reduces aggression, facilitating better model learning for sales-customer interactions.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces TVB-HKSL-News, a new Hong Kong sign language (HKSL) dataset collected from a TV news program over a period of 7 months.The dataset is collected to enrich resources for HKSL and support research in large-vocabulary continuous sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT).It consists of 16.07 hours of sign videos of two signers with a vocabulary of 6,515 glosses (for SLR) and 2,850 Chinese characters or 18K Chinese words (for SLT).One signer has 11.66 hours of sign videos and the other has 4.41 hours.One objective in building the dataset is to support the investigation of how well large-vocabulary continuous sign language recognition/translation can be done for a single signer given a (relatively) large amount of his/her training data, which could potentially lead to the development of new modeling methods.Besides, most parts of the data collection pipeline are automated with little human intervention; we believe that our collection method can be scaled up to collect more sign language data easily for SLT in the future for any sign languages if such sign-interpreted videos are available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also run a SOTA SLR/SLT model on the dataset and get a baseline SLR word error rate of 34.08% and a baseline SLT BLEU-4 score of 23.58 for benchmarking future research on the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated remarkable performance comparable to human capabilities across various supervised computer vision tasks.However, the prevalent assumption of having an extensive pool of training data encompassing all classes prior to model training often diverges from real-world scenarios, where limited data availability for novel classes is the norm.The challenge emerges in seamlessly integrating new classes with few samples into the training data, demanding the model to adeptly accommodate these additions without compromising its performance on base classes.To address this exigency, the research community has introduced several solutions under the realm of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL).   In this study, we introduce an innovative FSCIL framework that utilizes language regularizer and subspace regularizer.During base training, the language regularizer helps incorporate semantic information extracted from a Vision-Language model.The subspace regularizer helps in facilitating the model's acquisition of nuanced connections between image and text semantics inherent to base classes during incremental training.Our proposed framework not only empowers the model to embrace novel classes with limited data, but also ensures the preservation of performance on base classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three distinct FSCIL benchmarks, where our framework attains state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span></p>

                  <p>In contemporary mobile user authentication systems, verifying user legitimacy has become paramount due to the widespread use of smartphones.Although fingerprint and facial recognition are widely used for mobile authentication, PIN-based authentication is still employed as a fallback option if biometric authentication fails after multiple attempts.Consequently, the system remains susceptible to attacks targeting the PIN when biometric methods are unsuccessful.In response to these concerns, two-factor authentication has been proposed, albeit with the caveat of increased user effort.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a passive authentication system that utilizes keystroke data, a byproduct of primary authentication methods, for background user authentication.Additionally, we introduce a novel image encoding technique to capture the temporal dynamics of keystroke data, overcoming the performance limitations of deep learning models.Furthermore, we present a methodology for selecting suitable behavioral biometric features for image representation.The resulting images, depicting the user's PIN input patterns, enhance the model's ability to uniquely identify users through the secondary channel with high accuracy.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed imaging approach surpasses existing methods in terms of information capacity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In self-collected dataset experiments, incorporating features from prior research, our method achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 6.7\%, outperforming the existing method's 47.7\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Moreover, our imaging technique attained a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 94.4\% and a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 8\% for 17 users.</p>

                  <p>Non-autoregressive (NAR) language models are known for their low latency in neural machine translation (NMT).However, a performance gap exists between NAR and autoregressive models due to the large decoding space and difficulty in capturing dependency between target words accurately.Compounding this, preparing appropriate training data for NAR models is a non-trivial task, often exacerbating exposure bias.To address these challenges, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to Levenshtein Transformer, a representative edit-based NAR model, demonstrating that RL with self-generated data can enhance the performance of edit-based NAR models.We explore two RL approaches: stepwise reward maximization and episodic reward maximization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss the respective pros and cons of these two approaches and empirically verify them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Moreover, we experimentally investigate the impact of temperature setting on performance, confirming the importance of proper temperature setting for NAR models' training.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML).The interest is driven by the numerous situations in real-life applications where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously.A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which illustrates the inherent trade-offs between objectives.Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature that could serve as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners who want to use MOO.Hence, our goal in this paper is to produce such a resource.We critically review previous studies, particularly those involving MOO in deep learning (using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a guiding example), and identify misconceptions that highlight the need for a better grasp of MOO principles in ML.Using MOO of PINNs as a case study, we demonstrate the interplay between the data loss and the physics loss terms.We highlight the most common pitfalls one should avoid while using MOO techniques in ML.We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more complex techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA).Additionally, we compare the results obtained from the WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence can result in inaccurate outcomes and, consequently, a non-optimal solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Our goal is to offer a clear and practical guide for ML practitioners to effectively apply MOO, particularly in the context of DL.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked interest in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that tailor these large models to application domains outside their training data.However, different PEFT techniques modify the representation of a model differently, making it a non-trivial task to select the most appropriate method for the domain of interest.We propose a new framework, Mixture-of-PEFTs methods (MoPEFT), that is inspired by traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methodologies and is utilized for fine-tuning SAM.Our MoPEFT framework incorporates three different PEFT techniques as submodules and dynamically learns to activate the ones that are best suited for a given data-task setup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test our method on the Segment Anything Model and show that MoPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods on the MESS benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) has garnered increasing attention due to its wide range of applications in various fields, including human-machine interaction, virtual assistants, and mental health assistance.However, existing SER methods often overlook the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, resulting in sub-optimal performance.Moreover, current methods require much time for fine-tuning on each specific speech dataset, such as IEMOCAP, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale noisy data.To address these issues, we propose an active learning (AL)-based fine-tuning framework for SER, called \textsc{After}, that leverages task adaptation pre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency.Specifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream speech emotion recognition task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, AL methods are employed to iteratively select a subset of the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, thereby reducing time consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method \textsc{After}, using only 20\% of samples, improves accuracy by 8.45\% and reduces time consumption by 79\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>The additional extension of \textsc{After} and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness and applicability to various real-world scenarios.Our source code is available on Github for reproducibility.(https://github.com/Clearloveyuan/AFTER).</p>

A graph is complete partite if there exists a partition of its vertex set such that every pair of vertices from different sets is connected by an edge and vertices from the same set form an independent set.A clique $K_t$ and a bipartite clique $K_{t,t}$ are examples of complete partite graphs.These problems are natural generalizations of the triangle-free and square-free $2$-matching problems in subcubic graphs.In the weighted setting we assume that the weights of edges of $G$ are vertex-induced on every forbidden subgraph.We present simple and fast combinatorial algorithms for these problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The presented algorithms are the first ones for the weighted versions, and for the unweighted ones, are faster than those known previously. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Our approach relies on the use of gadgets with so-called half-edges.A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces MMTryon, a multi-modal multi-reference VIrtual Try-ON (VITON) framework, which can generate high-quality compositional try-on results by taking as inputs a text instruction and multiple garment images.Our MMTryon mainly addresses two problems overlooked in prior literature: 1) Support of multiple try-on items and dressing styleExisting methods are commonly designed for single-item try-on tasks (e.g., upper/lower garments, dresses) and fall short on customizing dressing styles (e.g., zipped/unzipped, tuck-in/tuck-out, etc.)2) Segmentation Dependency.They further heavily rely on category-specific segmentation models to identify the replacement regions, with segmentation errors directly leading to significant artifacts in the try-on results.For the first issue, our MMTryon introduces a novel multi-modality and multi-reference attention mechanism to combine the garment information from reference images and dressing-style information from text instructions.Besides, to remove the segmentation dependency, MMTryon uses a parsing-free garment encoder and leverages a novel scalable data generation pipeline to convert existing VITON datasets to a form that allows MMTryon to be trained without requiring any explicit segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on high-resolution benchmarks and in-the-wild test sets demonstrate MMTryon's superiority over existing SOTA methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Besides, MMTryon's impressive performance on multi-items and style-controllable virtual try-on scenarios and its ability to try on any outfit in a large variety of scenarios from any source image, opens up a new avenue for future investigation in the fashion community.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning applications on extremely low-power devices, commonly referred to as tiny machine learning (TinyML), promises a smarter and more connected world.However, the advancement of current TinyML research is hindered by the limited size and quality of pertinent datasets.To address this challenge, we introduce Wake Vision, a large-scale, diverse dataset tailored for person detection -- the canonical task for TinyML visual sensing.Wake Vision comprises over 6 million images, which is a hundredfold increase compared to the previous standard, and has undergone thorough quality filtering.Using Wake Vision for training results in a 2.41\% increase in accuracy compared to the established benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Alongside the dataset, we provide a collection of five detailed benchmark sets that assess model performance on specific segments of the test data, such as varying lighting conditions, distances from the camera, and demographic characteristics of subjects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These novel fine-grained benchmarks facilitate the evaluation of model quality in challenging real-world scenarios that are often ignored when focusing solely on overall accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Through an evaluation of a MobileNetV2 TinyML model on the benchmarks, we show that the input resolution plays a more crucial role than the model width in detecting distant subjects and that the impact of quantization on model robustness is minimal, thanks to the dataset quality.These findings underscore the importance of a detailed evaluation to identify essential factors for model development.The dataset, benchmark suite, code, and models are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, enabling their use for commercial use cases.</p>

                  <p>Conformal prediction is a powerful tool to generate uncertainty sets with guaranteed coverage using any predictive model, under the assumption that the training and test data are i.i.d..Recently, it has been shown that adversarial examples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets with invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated.To address this issue, a recent work, Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP), was first proposed to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to adversarial noise.However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness guarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large uncertainty sets.To address these limitations, we first propose a novel framework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation, which fixes the issues in the original RSCP method.Next, we propose two novel methods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results in CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet suggest the baseline method only yields trivial predictions including full label set, while our methods could boost the efficiency by up to $4.36\times$, $5.46\times$, and $16.9\times$ respectively and provide practical robustness guarantee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Our codes are available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/Provably-Robust-Conformal-Prediction.</p>

One of our new bounds, in contrast to the existing ones, allows us to separate complete-link from single-link in terms of approximation for the diameter, which corroborates the common perception that the former is more suitable than the latter when the goal is producing compact clusters.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our techniques can be employed to derive upper bounds on the cohesion of a class of linkage methods that includes the quite popular average-link. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding the non-literal meaning of an utterance is critical for large language models (LLMs) to become human-like social communicators.In this work, we introduce SwordsmanImp, the first Chinese multi-turn-dialogue-based dataset aimed at conversational implicature, sourced from dialogues in the Chinese sitcom $\textit{My Own Swordsman}$.It includes 200 carefully handcrafted questions, all annotated on which Gricean maxims have been violated.We test eight close-source and open-source LLMs under two tasks: a multiple-choice question task and an implicature explanation task.Our results show that GPT-4 attains human-level accuracy (94%) on multiple-choice questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CausalLM demonstrates a 78.5% accuracy following GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Other models, including GPT-3.5 and several open-source models, demonstrate a lower accuracy ranging from 20% to 60% on multiple-choice questions.Human raters were asked to rate the explanation of the implicatures generated by LLMs on their reasonability, logic and fluency.While all models generate largely fluent and self-consistent text, their explanations score low on reasonability except for GPT-4, suggesting that most LLMs cannot produce satisfactory explanations of the implicatures in the conversation.Moreover, we find LLMs' performance does not vary significantly by Gricean maxims, suggesting that LLMs do not seem to process implicatures derived from different maxims differently.Our data and code are available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/llm-pragmatics.</p>

                  <p>Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series.These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance.However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets.The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples.Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations.In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task.Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning.We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models.We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series.We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches.</p>

                  <p>General purpose Large Language Models (LLM) such as the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) have attracted much attention in recent years.There is strong evidence that these models can perform remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks.However, how to leverage them to approach domain-specific use cases and drive value remains an open question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we focus on a specific use case, pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations, and propose that leveraging historical records of manufacturing incidents and deviations in an organization can be beneficial for addressing and closing new cases, or de-risking new manufacturing campaigns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Using a small but diverse dataset of real manufacturing deviations selected from different product lines, we evaluate and quantify the power of three general purpose LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2) in performing tasks related to the above goal.In particular, (1) the ability of LLMs in automating the process of extracting specific information such as root cause of a case from unstructured data, as well as (2) the possibility of identifying similar or related deviations by performing semantic search on the database of historical records are examined.While our results point to the high accuracy of GPT-4 and Claude-2 in the information extraction task, we discuss cases of complex interplay between the apparent reasoning and hallucination behavior of LLMs as a risk factor.Furthermore, we show that semantic search on vector embedding of deviation descriptions can be used to identify similar records, such as those with a similar type of defect, with a high level of accuracy.We discuss further improvements to enhance the accuracy of similar record identification.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML).The interest is driven by the numerous situations in real-life applications where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously.A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which illustrates the inherent trade-offs between objectives.Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature that could serve as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners who want to use MOO.Hence, our goal in this paper is to produce such a resource.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We critically review previous studies, particularly those involving MOO in deep learning (using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a guiding example), and identify misconceptions that highlight the need for a better grasp of MOO principles in ML. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.569</span></span>Using MOO of PINNs as a case study, we demonstrate the interplay between the data loss and the physics loss terms.We highlight the most common pitfalls one should avoid while using MOO techniques in ML.We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more complex techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA).Additionally, we compare the results obtained from the WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II.We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence can result in inaccurate outcomes and, consequently, a non-optimal solution.Our goal is to offer a clear and practical guide for ML practitioners to effectively apply MOO, particularly in the context of DL.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the rise of Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), i.e., specialized AI systems designed to simulate assigned personas.By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance.RPLAs can mimic a wide range of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions, interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies.We categorize personas into three types: 1) Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2) Character Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3) Individualized Persona, customized through ongoing user interactions for personalized services.We begin by presenting a comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation.Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs.Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI applications, which reflects practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research.Through this work, we aim to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, and facilitate future research in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and RPLAs coexist in harmony.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data.It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications.While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required.Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology.To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems.By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span></p>

                  <p>Blockchain applications often rely on lightweight clients to access and verify on-chain data efficiently without the need to run a resource-intensive full node.These light clients must maintain robust security to protect the blockchain's integrity for users of applications built upon it, achieving this with minimal resources and without significant latency.Moreover, different applications have varying security needs.This work focuses on addressing these two key requirements in the context of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains and identifying the fundamental cost-latency trade-offs to achieve tailored, optimal security for each light client.   The key security guarantee of PoS blockchains is economic (implied by the "stake").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper we formalize this cryptoeconomic security to light clients, ensuring that the cost of corrupting the data provided to light clients must outweigh the potential profit, thereby economically deterring malicious actors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further introduce "insured" cryptoeconomic security to light clients, providing unconditional protection via the attribution of adversarial actions and the consequent slashing of stakes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>The divisible and fungible nature of stake facilitates programmable security, allowing for customization of the security level and insurance amount according to the specific needs of different applications.

                  <p>Mission critical communication (MCC) involves the exchange of information and data among emergency services, including the police, fire brigade, and other first responders, particularly during emergencies, disasters, or critical incidents.The widely-adopted TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio)-based communication for mission critical services faces challenges including limited data capacity, coverage limitations, spectrum congestion, and security concerns.Therefore, as an alternative, mission critical communication over cellular networks (4G and 5G) has emerged.While cellular-based MCC enables features like real-time video streaming and high-speed data transmission, the involvement of network operators and application service providers in the MCC architecture raises privacy concerns for mission critical users and services.For instance, the disclosure of a policeman's location details to the network operator raises privacy concerns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, no existing work considers the privacy issues in mission critical system with respect to 5G and upcoming technologies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Therefore, in this paper, we analyse the 3GPP standardised MCC architecture within the context of 5G core network concepts and assess the privacy implications for MC users, network entities, and MC servers.The privacy analysis adheres to the deployment strategies in the standard for MCC.Additionally, we explore emerging 6G technologies, such as off-network communications, joint communication and sensing, and non-3GPP communications, to identify privacy challenges in MCC architecture.Finally, we propose privacy controls to establish a next-generation privacy-preserving MCC architecture.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, intelligent systems are increasingly integrating into everyday life and people's homes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the proliferation of these technologies raises concerns about the security of smart home devices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>These devices often face resource constraints and may connect to unreliable networks, posing risks to the data they handle.Securing IoT technology is crucial due to the sensitive data involved.   Preventing energy attacks and ensuring the security of IoT infrastructure are key challenges in modern smart homes.Monitoring energy consumption can be an effective approach to detecting abnormal behavior and IoT cyberattacks.Lightweight algorithms are necessary to accommodate the resource limitations of IoT devices.   This paper presents a lightweight technique for detecting energy consumption attacks on smart home devices by analyzing received packets.The proposed algorithm considers TCP, UDP, and MQTT protocols, as well as device statuses (Idle, active, under attack).It accounts for resource constraints and promptly alerts administrators upon detecting an attack.The proposed approach effectively identifies energy consumption attacks by measuring packet reception rates for different protocols.</p>

Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>
