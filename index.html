                  <p>A key aspect of language documentation is the creation of annotated text in a format such as interlinear glossed text (IGT), which captures fine-grained morphosyntactic analyses in a morpheme-by-morpheme format.Prior work has explored methods to automatically generate IGT in order to reduce the time cost of language analysis.However, many languages (particularly those requiring preservation) lack sufficient IGT data to train effective models, and crosslingual transfer has been proposed as a method to overcome this limitation.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compile the largest existing corpus of IGT data from a variety of sources, covering over 450k examples across 1.8k languages, to enable research on crosslingual transfer and IGT generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>Then, we pretrain a large multilingual model on a portion of this corpus, and further finetune it to specific languages.Our model is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for segmented data and large monolingual datasets.Meanwhile, our model outperforms SOTA models on unsegmented text and small corpora by up to 6.6% morpheme accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of crosslingual transfer for low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>Pre-training has been investigated to improve the efficiency and performance of training neural operators in data-scarce settings.However, it is largely in its infancy due to the inherent complexity and diversity, such as long trajectories, multiple scales and varying dimensions of partial differential equations (PDEs) data.In this paper, we present a new auto-regressive denoising pre-training strategy, which allows for more stable and efficient pre-training on PDE data and generalizes to various downstream tasks.Moreover, by designing a flexible and scalable model architecture based on Fourier attention, we can easily scale up the model for large-scale pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train our PDE foundation model with up to 0.5B parameters on 10+ PDE datasets with more than 100k trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Extensive experiments show that we achieve SOTA on these benchmarks and validate the strong generalizability of our model to significantly enhance performance on diverse downstream PDE tasks like 3D data.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/thu-ml/DPOT}.</p>

                  <p>It is especially challenging to achieve real-time human motion tracking on a standalone VR Head-Mounted Display (HMD) such as Meta Quest and PICO.In this paper, we propose HMD-Poser, the first unified approach to recover full-body motions using scalable sparse observations from HMD and body-worn IMUs.In particular, it can support a variety of input scenarios, such as HMD, HMD+2IMUs, HMD+3IMUs, etc.The scalability of inputs may accommodate users' choices for both high tracking accuracy and easy-to-wear.A lightweight temporal-spatial feature learning network is proposed in HMD-Poser to guarantee that the model runs in real-time on HMDs.Furthermore, HMD-Poser presents online body shape estimation to improve the position accuracy of body joints.Extensive experimental results on the challenging AMASS dataset show that HMD-Poser achieves new state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and real-time performance.We also build a new free-dancing motion dataset to evaluate HMD-Poser's on-device performance and investigate the performance gap between synthetic data and real-captured sensor data.Finally, we demonstrate our HMD-Poser with a real-time Avatar-driving application on a commercial HMD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and free-dancing motion dataset are available https://pico-ai-team.github.io/hmd-poser <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>National Security Letters (NSLs) are similar to administrative subpoenas and can be issued directly by elements of the executive branch without requiring prior approval from a court or grand jury.Importantly, NSLs authorize the imposition of nondisclosure orders (aka "gag orders") on the receiving party.Controversy about potential abuses of this authority has driven a range of legal and policy discussions.To address these concerns, both the public sector and the private sector have sought to document the usage of NSLs in aggregated form.However, each data source is limited in scope, time, and kind.   In this paper, we consolidate the available data around NSLs and answer two questions: (1) what can the public effectively learn from the reported data and does this information suffice to assess the NSL usage?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) how accessible is this data collection? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>We show that longitudinal trends in the usage of NSLs can be observed.For instance, we find a significant increase in NSL requests for non-US persons and that the policy reforms to decrease the mandated nondisclosure period appear to be effective.The observed trends suggest that the current transparency mechanisms are viable safeguards against the excessive use of NSLs.However, aggregating and normalizing the data requires manual reviewing, parsing, and validating.We even find inconsistencies within and across official data sources.Overall, the laborious data collection process hinders external and internal auditing efforts and demonstrates the need for a unified and more usable dataset for NSLs.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reward hacking occurs when an agent performs very well with respect to a "proxy" reward function (which may be hand-specified or learned), but poorly with respect to the unknown true reward.Since ensuring good alignment between the proxy and true reward is extremely difficult, one approach to prevent reward hacking is optimizing the proxy conservatively.Prior work has particularly focused on enforcing the learned policy to behave similarly to a "safe" policy by penalizing the KL divergence between their action distributions (AD).However, AD regularization doesn't always work well since a small change in action distribution at a single state can lead to potentially calamitous outcomes, while large changes might not be indicative of any dangerous activity.Our insight is that when reward hacking, the agent visits drastically different states from those reached by the safe policy, causing large deviations in state occupancy measure (OM).Thus, we propose regularizing based on the OM divergence between policies instead of AD divergence to prevent reward hacking.We theoretically establish that OM regularization can more effectively avoid large drops in true reward.Then, we empirically demonstrate in a variety of realistic environments that OM divergence is superior to AD divergence for preventing reward hacking by regularizing towards a safe policy.Furthermore, we show that occupancy measure divergence can also regularize learned policies away from reward hacking behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/orpo <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span></p>

                  <p>Educational chatbots are a promising tool for assisting student learning.However, the development of effective chatbots in education has been challenging, as high-quality data is seldom available in this domain.In this paper, we propose a framework for generating synthetic teacher-student interactions grounded in a set of textbooks.Our approaches capture one aspect of learning interactions where curious students with partial knowledge interactively ask a teacher questions about the material in the textbook.We highlight various quality criteria that such dialogues should fulfill and compare several approaches relying on either prompting or fine-tuning large language models.We use synthetic dialogues to train educational chatbots and show benefits of further fine-tuning in different educational domains.However, human evaluation shows that our best data synthesis method still suffers from hallucinations and tends to reiterate information from previous conversations.Our findings offer insights for future efforts in synthesizing conversational data that strikes a balance between size and quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will open-source our data and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), also called zero-shot or dataless text classification, has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability in classifying a mass of texts within the dynamic and open Web environment, since it requires only a limited set of seed words (label names) for each category instead of labeled data.With the help of recently popular prompting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), many studies leveraged manually crafted and/or automatically identified verbalizers to estimate the likelihood of categories, but they failed to differentiate the effects of these category-indicative words, let alone capture their correlations and realize adaptive adjustments according to the unlabeled corpus.In this paper, in order to let the PLM effectively understand each category, we at first propose a novel form of rule-based knowledge using logical expressions to characterize the meanings of categories.Then, we develop a prompting PLM-based approach named RulePrompt for the WSTC task, consisting of a rule mining module and a rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module, plus a self-supervised fine-tuning module to make the PLM align with this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, the inaccurate pseudo labels assigned to texts and the imprecise logical rules associated with categories mutually enhance each other in an alternative manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>That establishes a self-iterative closed loop of knowledge (rule) acquisition and utilization, with seed words serving as the starting point.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which markedly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.What is more, our approach yields interpretable category rules, proving its advantage in disambiguating easily-confused categories.</p>

                  <p>While standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training is proven effective for image classification on in-distribution data, it fails to perform well on out-of-distribution samples.One of the main sources of distribution shift for image classification is the compositional nature of images.Specifically, in addition to the main object or component(s) determining the label, some other image components usually exist, which may lead to the shift of input distribution between train and test environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, these components may have spurious correlations with the label. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address this issue, we propose Decompose-and-Compose (DaC), which improves robustness to correlation shift by a compositional approach based on combining elements of images.Based on our observations, models trained with ERM usually highly attend to either the causal components or the components having a high spurious correlation with the label (especially in datapoints on which models have a high confidence).In fact, according to the amount of spurious correlation and the easiness of classification based on the causal or non-causal components, the model usually attends to one of these more (on samples with high confidence).Following this, we first try to identify the causal components of images using class activation maps of models trained with ERM.Afterward, we intervene on images by combining them and retraining the model on the augmented data, including the counterfactual ones.Along with its high interpretability, this work proposes a group-balancing method by intervening on images without requiring group labels or information regarding the spurious features during training.The method has an overall better worst group accuracy compared to previous methods with the same amount of supervision on the group labels in correlation shift.</p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation aims to provide users with personalized suggestions based on their historical interactions.When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batching-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length.The special value \emph{0} is usually used as the padding content, which does not contain the actual information and is ignored in the model calculations.This common-sense padding strategy leads us to a problem that has never been explored before: \emph{Can we fully utilize this idle input space by padding other content to further improve model performance and training efficiency?}   In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective padding method called \textbf{Rep}eated \textbf{Pad}ding (\textbf{RepPad}).Specifically, we use the original interaction sequences as the padding content and fill it to the padding positions during model training.This operation can be performed a finite number of times or repeated until the input sequences' length reaches the maximum limit.Our RepPad can be viewed as a sequence-level data augmentation strategy.Unlike most existing works, our method contains no trainable parameters or hyperparameters and is a plug-and-play data augmentation operation.Extensive experiments on various categories of sequential models and five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The average recommendation performance improvement is up to 60.3\% on GRU4Rec and 24.3\% on SASRec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We also provide in-depth analysis and explanation of what makes RepPad effective from multiple perspectives.The source code will be released to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments.</p>

                  <p>To enhance localization accuracy in urban environments, an innovative LiDAR-Visual-Inertial odometry, named HDA-LVIO, is proposed by employing hybrid data association.The proposed HDA_LVIO system can be divided into two subsystems: the LiDAR-Inertial subsystem (LIS) and the Visual-Inertial subsystem (VIS).In the LIS, the LiDAR pointcloud is utilized to calculate the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) error, serving as the measurement value of Error State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) to construct the global map.In the VIS, an incremental method is firstly employed to adaptively extract planes from the global map.And the centroids of these planes are projected onto the image to obtain projection points.Then, feature points are extracted from the image and tracked along with projection points using Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow.Next, leveraging the vehicle states from previous intervals, sliding window optimization is performed to estimate the depth of feature points.Concurrently, a method based on epipolar geometric constraints is proposed to address tracking failures for feature points, which can improve the accuracy of depth estimation for feature points by ensuring sufficient parallax within the sliding window.Subsequently, the feature points and projection points are hybridly associated to construct reprojection error, serving as the measurement value of ESIKF to estimate vehicle states.Finally, the localization accuracy of the proposed HDA-LVIO is validated using public datasets and data from our equipment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves obviously improvement in localization accuracy compared to various existing algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large size kernels have attracted much attention in the computer vision field, following the success of the Vision Transformers.Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance.The reason for the high-performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels, but this view has not been fully tested.We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task, focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task.WSOL, a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised, provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs.Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance.Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective, in which the main factor is feature map improvement.Furthermore, we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated, which has long been discussed in WSOL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CAM is the most classic WSOL method, but because of the above-mentioned problems, it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>However, experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN, CAM, and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method, which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing.The code is available at https://github.com/snskysk/CAM-Back-Again.</p>

                  <p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) stands as an effective intervention for alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).Traditional commercial DBS devices are only able to deliver fixed-frequency periodic pulses to the basal ganglia (BG) regions of the brain, i.e., continuous DBS (cDBS).However, they in general suffer from energy inefficiency and side effects, such as speech impairment.Recent research has focused on adaptive DBS (aDBS) to resolve the limitations of cDBS.Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches have been developed to adapt the frequencies of the stimuli in order to achieve both energy efficiency and treatment efficacy.However, RL approaches in general require significant amount of training data and computational resources, making it intractable to integrate RL policies into real-time embedded systems as needed in aDBS.In contrast, contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) in general lead to better sample efficiency compared to RL.In this study, we propose a CMAB solution for aDBS.Specifically, we define the context as the signals capturing irregular neuronal firing activities in the BG regions (i.e., beta-band power spectral density), while each arm signifies the (discretized) pulse frequency of the stimulation.Moreover, an {\epsilon}-exploring strategy is introduced on top of the classic Thompson sampling method, leading to an algorithm called {\epsilon}-Neural Thompson sampling ({\epsilon}-NeuralTS), such that the learned CMAB policy can better balance exploration and exploitation of the BG environment.The {\epsilon}-NeuralTS algorithm is evaluated using a computation BG model that captures the neuronal activities in PD patients' brains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that our method outperforms both existing cDBS methods and CMAB baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine Learning (ML) has replaced traditional handcrafted methods for perception and prediction in autonomous vehicles.Yet for the equally important planning task, the adoption of ML-based techniques is slow.We present nuPlan, the world's first real-world autonomous driving dataset, and benchmark.The benchmark is designed to test the ability of ML-based planners to handle diverse driving situations and to make safe and efficient decisions.To that end, we introduce a new large-scale dataset that consists of 1282 hours of diverse driving scenarios from 4 cities (Las Vegas, Boston, Pittsburgh, and Singapore) and includes high-quality auto-labeled object tracks and traffic light data.We exhaustively mine and taxonomize common and rare driving scenarios which are used during evaluation to get fine-grained insights into the performance and characteristics of a planner.Beyond the dataset, we provide a simulation and evaluation framework that enables a planner's actions to be simulated in closed-loop to account for interactions with other traffic participants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a detailed analysis of numerous baselines and investigate gaps between ML-based and traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Find the nuPlan dataset and code at nuplan.org.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm enabling collaborative model training on decentralized devices without exposing their local data.A key challenge in FL is the uneven data distribution across client devices, violating the well-known assumption of independent-and-identically-distributed (IID) training samples in conventional machine learning.Clustered federated learning (CFL) addresses this challenge by grouping clients based on the similarity of their data distributions.However, existing CFL approaches require a large number of communication rounds for stable cluster formation and rely on a predefined number of clusters, thus limiting their flexibility and adaptability.This paper proposes FedClust, a novel CFL approach leveraging correlations between local model weights and client data distributions.FedClust groups clients into clusters in a one-shot manner using strategically selected partial model weights and dynamically accommodates newcomers in real-time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate FedClust outperforms baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and communication costs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span></p>

In this paper, we develop an approach to reliably augment the implementation with explanatory names.We recover fine-grained input-output data from the synthesis algorithm to enhance the prompt supplied to the LLM, and use a combination of a program verifier and a second language model to validate the proposed explanations before presenting them to the user.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, these techniques massively improve the accuracy of the proposed names, from 24% to 79% respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Through a pair of small user studies, we find that users significantly prefer the explanations produced by our technique (76% of responses indicating the appropriateness of the presenting names) to the baseline (with only 2% of responses approving of the suggestions), and that the proposed names measurably help users in understanding the synthesized implementation.</p>

Second, some papers don't use a realistic membership base rate, leading to incorrect precision measures if precision is reported.Third, some papers unnecessarily report measures in such a way that it is difficult or impossible to assess risk.Virtually the entire literature on membership inference attacks, dozens of papers, make one or both of these errors.We propose that membership inference papers report precision/recall values using a representative range of base rates.</p>

                  <p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer an agent's preferences (represented as a reward function $R$) from their behaviour (represented as a policy $\pi$).To do this, we need a behavioural model of how $\pi$ relates to $R$. In the current literature, the most common behavioural models are optimality, Boltzmann-rationality, and causal entropy maximisation.However, the true relationship between a human's preferences and their behaviour is much more complex than any of these behavioural models.This means that the behavioural models are misspecified, which raises the concern that they may lead to systematic errors if applied to real data.In this paper, we analyse how sensitive the IRL problem is to misspecification of the behavioural model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that completely characterise how the observed data may differ from the assumed behavioural model without incurring an error above a given threshold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>In addition to this, we also characterise the conditions under which a behavioural model is robust to small perturbations of the observed policy, and we analyse how robust many behavioural models are to misspecification of their parameter values (such as e.g.\ the discount rate).Our analysis suggests that the IRL problem is highly sensitive to misspecification, in the sense that very mild misspecification can lead to very large errors in the inferred reward function.</p>

                  <p>Traditional sequential recommendation methods assume that users' sequence data is clean enough to learn accurate sequence representations to reflect user preferences.In practice, users' sequences inevitably contain noise (e.g., accidental interactions), leading to incorrect reflections of user preferences.Consequently, some pioneer studies have explored modeling sequentiality and correlations in sequences to implicitly or explicitly reduce noise's influence.However, relying on only available intra-sequence information (i.e., sequentiality and correlations in a sequence) is insufficient and may result in over-denoising and under-denoising problems (OUPs), especially for short sequences.To improve reliability, we propose to augment sequences by inserting items before denoising.However, due to the data sparsity issue and computational costs, it is challenging to select proper items from the entire item universe to insert into proper positions in a target sequence.Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel framework--Self-augmented Sequence Denoising for sequential Recommendation (SSDRec) with a three-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges.In the first stage, we empower SSDRec by a global relation encoder to learn multi-faceted inter-sequence relations in a data-driven manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These relations serve as prior knowledge to guide subsequent stages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>In the second stage, we devise a self-augmentation module to augment sequences to alleviate OUPs.Finally, we employ a hierarchical denoising module in the third stage to reduce the risk of false augmentations and pinpoint all noise in raw sequences.Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of \model over state-of-the-art denoising methods and its flexible applications to mainstream sequential recommendation models.The source code is available at https://github.com/zc-97/SSDRec.</p>

                  <p>Social recommendation systems face the problem of social influence bias, which can lead to an overemphasis on recommending items that friends have interacted with.Addressing this problem is crucial, and existing methods often rely on techniques such as weight adjustment or leveraging unbiased data to eliminate this bias.However, we argue that not all biases are detrimental, i.e., some items recommended by friends may align with the user's interests.Blindly eliminating such biases could undermine these positive effects, potentially diminishing recommendation accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a Causal Disentanglement-based framework for Regulating Social influence Bias in social recommendation, named CDRSB, to improve recommendation performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>From the perspective of causal inference, we find that the user social network could be regarded as a confounder between the user and item embeddings (treatment) and ratings (outcome). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the presence of this social network confounder, two paths exist from user and item embeddings to ratings: a non-causal social influence path and a causal interest path. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Building upon this insight, we propose a disentangled encoder that focuses on disentangling user and item embeddings into interest and social influence embeddings.Mutual information-based objectives are designed to enhance the distinctiveness of these disentangled embeddings, eliminating redundant information.Additionally, a regulatory decoder that employs a weight calculation module to dynamically learn the weights of social influence embeddings for effectively regulating social influence bias has been designed.Experimental results on four large-scale real-world datasets Ciao, Epinions, Dianping, and Douban book demonstrate the effectiveness of CDRSB compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we explore the capability of an agent to construct a logical sequence of action steps, thereby assembling a strategic procedural plan.This plan is crucial for navigating from an initial visual observation to a target visual outcome, as depicted in real-life instructional videos.Existing works have attained partial success by extensively leveraging various sources of information available in the datasets, such as heavy intermediate visual observations, procedural names, or natural language step-by-step instructions, for features or supervision signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the task remains formidable due to the implicit causal constraints in the sequencing of steps and the variability inherent in multiple feasible plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.58</span></span>To tackle these intricacies that previous efforts have overlooked, we propose to enhance the capabilities of the agent by infusing it with procedural knowledge.This knowledge, sourced from training procedure plans and structured as a directed weighted graph, equips the agent to better navigate the complexities of step sequencing and its potential variations.We coin our approach KEPP, a novel Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning system, which harnesses a probabilistic procedural knowledge graph extracted from training data, effectively acting as a comprehensive textbook for the training domain.Experimental evaluations across three widely-used datasets under settings of varying complexity reveal that KEPP attains superior, state-of-the-art results while requiring only minimal supervision.</p>

This is an Learned Image Compression (LIC) model trained using edge information created by Segment Anything.   Our method can be used for image recognition models with various tasks.   SA-ICM is also robust to changes in input data, making it effective for a variety of use cases.   Additionally, our method provides benefits from a privacy point of view, as it removes human facial information on the encoder's side, thus protecting one's privacy.   Furthermore, this LIC model training method can be used to train Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV), which is a video compression model.   By training NeRV using edge information created by Segment Anything, it is possible to create a NeRV that is effective for image recognition (SA-NeRV).   Experimental results confirm the advantages of SA-ICM, presenting the best performance in image compression for image recognition.   We also show that SA-NeRV is superior to ordinary NeRV in video compression for machines.</p>

                  <p>Training high-quality deep learning models is a challenging task due to computational and technical requirements.A growing number of individuals, institutions, and companies increasingly rely on pre-trained, third-party models made available in public repositories.These models are often used directly or integrated in product pipelines with no particular precautions, since they are effectively just data in tensor form and considered safe.In this paper, we raise awareness of a new machine learning supply chain threat targeting neural networks.We introduce MaleficNet 2.0, a novel technique to embed self-extracting, self-executing malware in neural networks.MaleficNet 2.0 uses spread-spectrum channel coding combined with error correction techniques to inject malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural networks.MaleficNet 2.0 injection technique is stealthy, does not degrade the performance of the model, and is robust against removal techniques.We design our approach to work both in traditional and distributed learning settings such as Federated Learning, and demonstrate that it is effective even when a reduced number of bits is used for the model parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept self-extracting neural network malware using MaleficNet 2.0, demonstrating the practicality of the attack against a widely adopted machine learning framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our aim with this work is to raise awareness against these new, dangerous attacks both in the research community and industry, and we hope to encourage further research in mitigation techniques against such threats. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span></p>

                  <p>To date, toxicity mitigation in language models has almost entirely been focused on single-language settings.As language models embrace multilingual capabilities, it's crucial our safety measures keep pace.Recognizing this research gap, our approach expands the scope of conventional toxicity mitigation to address the complexities presented by multiple languages.In the absence of sufficient annotated datasets across languages, we employ translated data to evaluate and enhance our mitigation techniques.We also compare finetuning mitigation approaches against retrieval-augmented techniques under both static and continual toxicity mitigation scenarios.This allows us to examine the effects of translation quality and the cross-lingual transfer on toxicity mitigation.We also explore how model size and data quantity affect the success of these mitigation efforts.Covering nine languages, our study represents a broad array of linguistic families and levels of resource availability, ranging from high to mid-resource languages.Through comprehensive experiments, we provide insights into the complexities of multilingual toxicity mitigation, offering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in this increasingly important field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/for-ai/goodtriever. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span></p>
