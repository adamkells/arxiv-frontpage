                  <p>In causal inference, generalization capability refers to the ability to conduct causal inference methods on new data to estimate the causal-effect between unknown phenomenon, which is crucial for expanding the boundaries of knowledge.Studies have evaluated the causal inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) concerning known phenomena, yet the generalization capabilities of LLMs concerning unseen phenomena remain unexplored.In this paper, we selected four tasks: Causal Path Discovery (CP), Backdoor Adjustment (BA), Factual Inference (FI), and Counterfactual Inference (CI) as representatives of causal inference tasks.To generate evaluation questions about previously unseen phenomena in new data on the four tasks, we propose a benchmark generation framework, which employs randomly generated graphs and node names to formulate questions within hypothetical new causal scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this framework, we compile a benchmark dataset of varying levels of question complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>We extensively tested the generalization capabilities of five leading LLMs across four tasks.Experiment results reveal that while LLMs exhibit good generalization performance in solving simple CP, FI, and complex CI questions, they encounter difficulties when tackling BA questions and face obvious performance fluctuations as the problem complexity changes.Furthermore, when the names of phenomena incorporate existing terms, even if these names are entirely novel, their generalization performance can still be hindered by interference from familiar terms.</p>

                  <p>As large language models rapidly evolve to support longer context, there is a notable disparity in their capability to generate output at greater lengths.Recent study suggests that the primary cause for this imbalance may arise from the lack of data with long-output during alignment training.In light of this observation, attempts are made to re-align foundation models with data that fills the gap, which result in models capable of generating lengthy output when instructed.In this paper, we explore the impact of data-quality in tuning a model for long output, and the possibility of doing so from the starting points of human-aligned (instruct or chat) models.With careful data curation, we show that it possible to achieve similar performance improvement in our tuned models, with only a small fraction of training data instances and compute.In addition, we assess the generalizability of such approaches by applying our tuning-recipes to several models.our findings suggest that, while capacities for generating long output vary across different models out-of-the-box, our approach to tune them with high-quality data using lite compute, consistently yields notable improvement across all models we experimented on.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have made public our curated dataset for tuning long-writing capability, the implementations of model tuning and evaluation, as well as the fine-tuned models, all of which can be openly-accessed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span></p>

                  <p>Meta-learning has emerged as a prominent technology for few-shot text classification and has achieved promising performance.However, existing methods often encounter difficulties in drawing accurate class prototypes from support set samples, primarily due to probable large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences within the task.Recent approaches attempt to incorporate external knowledge or pre-trained language models to augment data, but this requires additional resources and thus does not suit many few-shot scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel solution to address this issue by adequately leveraging the information within the task itself.Specifically, we utilize label information to construct a task-adaptive metric space, thereby adaptively reducing the intra-class differences and magnifying the inter-class differences.We further employ the optimal transport technique to estimate class prototypes with query set samples together, mitigating the problem of inaccurate and ambiguous support set samples caused by large intra-class differences.We conduct extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets, and our approach shows obvious advantages over state-of-the-art models across all the tasks on all the datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For reproducibility, all the datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/YvoGao/LAQDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.935</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in mono-channel audio generation.However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapes often have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions.Controlling stereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costs and unstable generative models.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address these issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first construct a large-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundant soundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Beyond text modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally paired stereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation.Existing audio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatial audio.To provide accurate guidance for latent diffusion models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance.By leveraging spatial guidance, our unified model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text and image but also enables interactive audio generation during inference.Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods.The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules.</p>

                  <p>This study exposes the safety vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, where malicious users can obscure harmful intents across several queries.We introduce ActorAttack, a novel multi-turn attack method inspired by actor-network theory, which models a network of semantically linked actors as attack clues to generate diverse and effective attack paths toward harmful targets.ActorAttack addresses two main challenges in multi-turn attacks: (1) concealing harmful intents by creating an innocuous conversation topic about the actor, and (2) uncovering diverse attack paths towards the same harmful target by leveraging LLMs' knowledge to specify the correlated actors as various attack clues.In this way, ActorAttack outperforms existing single-turn and multi-turn attack methods across advanced aligned LLMs, even for GPT-o1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will publish a dataset called SafeMTData, which includes multi-turn adversarial prompts and safety alignment data, generated by ActorAttack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span>We demonstrate that models safety-tuned using our safety dataset are more robust to multi-turn attacks.Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/ActorAttack.</p>

                  <p>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive advancements, yet information about their training data, a critical factor in their performance, remains undisclosed.Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific instance was part of a target model's training data.MIAs can offer insights into LLM outputs and help detect and address concerns such as data contamination and compliance with privacy and copyright standards.However, applying MIAs to LLMs presents unique challenges due to the massive scale of pre-training data and the ambiguous nature of membership.Additionally, creating appropriate benchmarks to evaluate MIA methods is not straightforward, as training and test data distributions are often unknown.In this paper, we introduce EM-MIA, a novel MIA method for LLMs that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm, leveraging the duality that the estimates of these scores can be improved by each other.Membership scores and prefix scores assess how each instance is likely to be a member and discriminative as a prefix, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the WikiMIA dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>To further evaluate EM-MIA, we present OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows us to control the difficulty of MIA tasks with varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions.We believe that EM-MIA serves as a robust MIA method for LLMs and that OLMoMIA provides a valuable resource for comprehensively evaluating MIA approaches, thereby driving future research in this critical area.</p>

                  <p>Human activities recognition is an important task for an intelligent robot, especially in the field of human-robot collaboration, it requires not only the label of sub-activities but also the temporal structure of the activity.In order to automatically recognize both the label and the temporal structure in sequence of human-object interaction, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN), which employs a pyramidal encoder-decoder architecture consisting of an attention based graph convolution network and a temporal pyramid pooling module for downsampling and upsampling interaction sequence on the temporal axis, respectively.The system represents the 2D or 3D spatial relation of human and objects from the detection results in video data as a graph.To learn the human-object relations, a new attention graph convolutional network is trained to extract condensed information from the graph representation.To segment action into sub-actions, a novel temporal pyramid pooling module is proposed, which upsamples compressed features back to the original time scale and classifies actions per frame.   We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</p>

                  <p>Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for learning.However, infrequently occurring concepts may have few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms, even in large KGs.For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples relative to the number of known diseases.Large Language Model (LLM) generation of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information extraction tasks.   Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13B<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Chat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>We measured overall and Out of Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data augmentation.We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4 different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.   Results:Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all 3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by 3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data.A small improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only one dataset showed OOD improvement.   Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data with synthetic mentions.Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance.The same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our software and dataset publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions.However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses.Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses.The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data.To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions.We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models.Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks.When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval.Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved reasonable quality improvements in machine translation (MT).However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces significant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when processing entire documents.In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a Document-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations.DelTA features a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various granularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and updated by auxiliary LLM-based components.Experimental results indicate that DelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation consistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two representative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in consistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to 3.16 points on average.DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient solution compared to the mainstream method.Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun translation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release our code and data at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.882</span></span></p>

                  <p>Achieving precise medical image segmentation is vital for effective treatment planning and accurate disease diagnosis.Traditional fully-supervised deep learning methods, though highly precise, are heavily reliant on large volumes of labeled data, which are often difficult to obtain due to the expertise required for medical annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This has led to the rise of semi-supervised learning approaches that utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to mitigate the label scarcity issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>In this paper, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Local Feature Modeling Network (MANet), which enhances the U-Net architecture by incorporating manifold supervision signals.This approach focuses on improving boundary accuracy, which is crucial for reliable medical diagnosis.To further extend the versatility of our method, we propose two variants: MA-Sobel and MA-Canny.The MA-Sobel variant employs the Sobel operator, which is effective for both 2D and 3D data, while the MA-Canny variant utilizes the Canny operator, specifically designed for 2D images, to refine boundary detection.These variants allow our method to adapt to various medical image modalities and dimensionalities, ensuring broader applicability.Our extensive experiments on datasets such as ACDC, LA, and Pancreas-NIH demonstrate that MANet consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores.The proposed method also shows improved generalization across various semi-supervised segmentation networks, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.Visual analysis of segmentation results confirms that MANet offers clearer and more accurate class boundaries, underscoring the value of manifold information in medical image segmentation.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaMA, and Claude have prevailed in countless domains, including legal scenarios.With LLMs' rapid technological progress, the development of prompt engineering (PE) as an interface between the LLMs and real-world applications has drawn the attention of all developers.Various PE methods have been proposed to overcome real-world challenges, such as few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).However, RAG for legal judgment prediction (LJP) is still underexplored.To address this, we propose "Athena", a novel framework cultivating RAG as a core preprocess component to enhance LLMs' performance on specialized tasks.Athena constructs a knowledge base for accusations, attached with a semantic retrieval mechanism through vectorization.Our experiments show that Athena's overall performance has improved significantly, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CAIL2018 dataset.Our ablation study on the in-context window size parameter further reproduces LLMs' "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon with a relative positional variation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>And with moderate hyper-parameter-tuning, we can achieve at most 95% of accuracy accordingly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We also study the impact of query rewriting and data distribution, providing possible directions for future research based on former analyses.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in differentially private federated learning (DPFL) algorithms have found that using correlated noise across the rounds of federated learning (DP-FTRL) yields provably and empirically better accuracy than using independent noise (DP-SGD).While DP-SGD is well-suited to federated learning with a single untrusted central server using lightweight secure aggregation protocols, secure aggregation is not conducive to implementing modern DP-FTRL techniques without assuming a trusted central server.DP-FTRL based approaches have already seen widespread deployment in industry, albeit with a trusted central curator who provides and applies the correlated noise.To realize a fully private, single untrusted server DP-FTRL federated learning protocol, we introduce secure stateful aggregation: a simple append-only data structure that allows for the private storage of aggregate values and reading linear functions of the aggregates.Assuming Ring Learning with Errors, we provide a lightweight and scalable realization of this protocol for high-dimensional data in a new security/resource model, Federated MPC : where a powerful persistent server interacts with weak, ephemeral clients.We observe that secure stateful aggregation suffices for realizing DP-FTRL-based private federated learning: improving DPFL utility guarantees over the state of the art while maintaining privacy with an untrusted central party.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach has minimal overhead relative to existing techniques which do not yield comparable utility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>The secure stateful aggregation primitive and the federated MPC paradigm may be of interest for other practical applications.</p>

                  <p>Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to recognize new classes with limited labeled data.Recent studies have attempted to address the challenge of rare samples with textual prompts to modulate visual features.However, they usually struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between textual and visual features.Moreover, vanilla self-attention is heavily affected by useless information in images, severely constraining the potential of semantic priors in FSL due to the confusion of numerous irrelevant tokens during interaction.To address these aforementioned issues, a K-NN Transformer with Pyramid Prompts (KTPP) is proposed to select discriminative information with K-NN Context Attention (KCA) and adaptively modulate visual features with Pyramid Cross-modal Prompts (PCP).First, for each token, the KCA only selects the K most relevant tokens to compute the self-attention matrix and incorporates the mean of all tokens as the context prompt to provide the global context in three cascaded stages.As a result, irrelevant tokens can be progressively suppressed.Secondly, pyramid prompts are introduced in the PCP to emphasize visual features via interactions between text-based class-aware prompts and multi-scale visual features.This allows the ViT to dynamically adjust the importance weights of visual features based on rich semantic information at different scales, making models robust to spatial variations.Finally, augmented visual features and class-aware prompts are interacted via the KCA to extract class-specific features.Consequently, our model further enhances noise-free visual representations via deep cross-modal interactions, extracting generalized visual representation in scenarios with few labeled samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span></p>

                  <p>Around 5-10\% of newborns need assistance to start breathing.Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based research, objective data collection, and opportunities for learning from real newborn resuscitation emergency events.Generating and evaluating automated newborn resuscitation algorithm activity timelines relative to the Time of Birth (ToB) offers a promising opportunity to enhance newborn care practices.Given the importance of prompt resuscitation interventions within the "golden minute" after birth, having an accurate ToB with second precision is essential for effective subsequent analysis of newborn resuscitation episodes.Instead, ToB is generally registered manually, often with minute precision, making the process inefficient and susceptible to error and imprecision.In this work, we explore the fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and thermal imaging to develop the first AI-driven ToB detector.The use of temperature information offers a promising alternative to detect the newborn while respecting the privacy of healthcare providers and mothers.However, the frequent inconsistencies in thermal measurements, especially in a multi-camera setup, make normalization strategies critical.Our methodology involves a three-step process: first, we propose an adaptive normalization method based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to mitigate issues related to temperature variations; second, we implement and deploy an AI model to detect the presence of the newborn within the thermal video frames; and third, we evaluate and post-process the model's predictions to estimate the ToB.A precision of 88.1\% and a recall of 89.3\% are reported in the detection of the newborn within thermal frames during performance evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach achieves an absolute median deviation of 2.7 seconds in estimating the ToB relative to the manual annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Conventional prediction methods such as logistic regression and gradient boosting have been widely utilized for disease onset prediction for their reliability and interpretability.Deep learning methods promise enhanced prediction performance by extracting complex patterns from clinical data, but face challenges like data sparsity and high dimensionality.   Methods: This study compares conventional and deep learning approaches to predict lung cancer, dementia, and bipolar disorder using observational data from eleven databases from North America, Europe, and Asia.Models were developed using logistic regression, gradient boosting, ResNet, and Transformer, and validated both internally and externally across the data sources.Discrimination performance was assessed using AUROC, and calibration was evaluated using Eavg.   Findings:Across 11 datasets, conventional methods generally outperformed deep learning methods in terms of discrimination performance, particularly during external validation, highlighting their better transportability.Learning curves suggest that deep learning models require substantially larger datasets to reach the same performance levels as conventional methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Calibration performance was also better for conventional methods, with ResNet showing the poorest calibration.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Interpretation: Despite the potential of deep learning models to capture complex patterns in structured observational healthcare data, conventional models remain highly competitive for disease onset prediction, especially in scenarios involving smaller datasets and if lengthy training times need to be avoided.The study underscores the need for future research focused on optimizing deep learning models to handle the sparsity, high dimensionality, and heterogeneity inherent in healthcare datasets, and find new strategies to exploit the full capabilities of deep learning methods.</p>

                  <p>The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning.Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information.Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space.As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space.To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE.Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model.To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Code and models are available at: https://github.com/modelscope/facechain/tree/main/face_module/TopoFR.</p>

                  <p>Despite significant advancements in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, existing methods still struggle to maintain robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications.Previous studies have attempted to address this challenge by exposing detectors to auxiliary OOD datasets alongside adversarial training.However, the increased data complexity inherent in adversarial training, and the myriad of ways that OOD samples can arise during testing, often prevent these approaches from establishing robust decision boundaries.To address these limitations, we propose AROS, a novel approach leveraging neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) with Lyapunov stability theorem in order to obtain robust embeddings for OOD detection.By incorporating a tailored loss function, we apply Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that both in-distribution (ID) and OOD data converge to stable equilibrium points within the dynamical system.This approach encourages any perturbed input to return to its stable equilibrium, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations.To not use additional data, we generate fake OOD embeddings by sampling from low-likelihood regions of the ID data feature space, approximating the boundaries where OOD data are likely to reside.To then further enhance robustness, we propose the use of an orthogonal binary layer following the stable feature space, which maximizes the separation between the equilibrium points of ID and OOD samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method through extensive experiments across several benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance, particularly under adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Notably, our approach improves robust detection performance from 37.8% to 80.1% on CIFAR-10 vs. CIFAR-100 and from 29.0% to 67.0% on CIFAR-100 vs. CIFAR-10.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of efforts to extend their capabilities to multimodal tasks.Among them, growing attention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM.Despite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a monolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging.In particular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a pre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and leads to performance degeneration.In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning.Specifically, our core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby incrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning, i.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters.Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure.Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP).In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>Experimental results not only validate the superior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on 6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but also confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced by up to 67%.</p>

In this work, we introduce Node Tokenizer for Large Language Models (NT-LLM), a novel framework that efficiently encodes graph structures by selecting key nodes as anchors and representing each node based on its relative distance to these anchors.This position-anchored encoding effectively captures the graph topology, enabling enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs over graph data.Additionally, we implement a task-specific tuning procedure to further improve structural understanding within LLMs.Through extensive empirical evaluations, NT-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements across a variety of graph-related tasks.</p>

                  <p>Recent works have shown that Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks.Existing defenses cluster submitted updates from clients and select the best cluster for aggregation.However, they often rely on unrealistic assumptions regarding client submissions and sampled clients population while choosing the best cluster.We show that in realistic FL settings, state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses struggle to perform well against backdoor attacks in FL.To address this, we highlight that backdoored submissions are adversarially biased and overconfident compared to clean submissions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We, therefore, propose an Adversarially Guided Stateful Defense (AGSD) against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in FL scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>AGSD employs adversarial perturbations to a small held-out dataset to compute a novel metric, called the trust index, that guides the cluster selection without relying on any unrealistic assumptions regarding client submissions.Moreover, AGSD maintains a trust state history of each client that adaptively penalizes backdoored clients and rewards clean clients.In realistic FL settings, where SOTA defenses mostly fail to resist attacks, AGSD mostly outperforms all SOTA defenses with minimal drop in clean accuracy (5% in the worst-case compared to best accuracy) even when (a) given a very small held-out dataset -- typically AGSD assumes 50 samples (<= 0.1% of the training data) and (b) no heldout dataset is available, and out-of-distribution data is used instead.For reproducibility, our code will be openly available at: https://github.com/hassanalikhatim/AGSD.</p>

In this paper, we introduce SIREN, a novel methodology to proactively trace unauthorized data usage in black-box personalized text-to-image diffusion models.Our approach optimizes the coating in a delicate way to be recognized by the model as a feature relevant to the personalization task, thus significantly improving its learnability.We also utilize a human perceptual-aware constraint, a hypersphere classification technique, and a hypothesis-testing-guided verification method to enhance the stealthiness and detection accuracy of the coating.The effectiveness of SIREN is verified through extensive experiments on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, models, and learning algorithms.SIREN is also effective in various real-world scenarios and evaluated against potential countermeasures.Our code is publicly available.</p>

In this work, we examine a key operational issue in AI auditing: what type of access to an AI system is needed to perform a meaningful audit?Addressing this question has direct policy relevance, as it can inform AI audit guidelines and requirements.We begin by discussing the factors that auditors balance when determining the appropriate type of access, and unpack the benefits and drawbacks of four types of access.We conclude that, at minimum, black-box access -- providing query access to a model without exposing its internal implementation -- should be granted to auditors, as it balances concerns related to trade secrets, data privacy, audit standardization, and audit efficiency.We then suggest a framework for determining how much further access (in addition to black-box access) to grant auditors.We show that auditing can be cast as a natural hypothesis test, draw parallels hypothesis testing and legal procedure, and argue that this framing provides clear and interpretable guidance on audit implementation.</p>

Moreover, systems leveraging human activity recognition frameworks for decision-making necessitate more than just the identification of actions.They require a confidence value indicative of the certainty regarding the correspondence between observations and training examples.This is crucial to prevent overly confident responses to unforeseen scenarios that were not part of the training data and may have resulted in mismatches due to weak similarity measures within the system.To address this, we propose the incorporation of a Spectral Normalized Residual connection aimed at enhancing efficient estimation of novelty in observations.This innovative approach ensures the preservation of input distance within the feature space by imposing constraints on the maximum gradients of weight updates.By limiting these gradients, we promote a more robust handling of novel situations, thereby mitigating the risks associated with overconfidence.Our methodology involves the use of a Gaussian process to quantify the distance in feature space.</p>

                Disease Entity Recognition and Normalization is Improved with Large Language Model Derived Synthetic Normalized Mentions

                  <p>Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for learning.However, infrequently occurring concepts may have few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms, even in large KGs.For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples relative to the number of known diseases.Large Language Model (LLM) generation of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information extraction tasks.   Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13BChat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group.We measured overall and Out of Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data augmentation.We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4 different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.   Results:Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all 3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by 3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data.A small improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only one dataset showed OOD improvement.   Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data with synthetic mentions.Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance.The same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our software and dataset publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>

                  <p>Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks.Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks.However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks.To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations.Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization.For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models.In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories.For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks.Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach.The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics.Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our anonymous website: https://sites.google.com/view/evaltasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>
