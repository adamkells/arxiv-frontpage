                  <p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images plays a vital role in a wide range of Earth Observation (EO) applications, such as land use land cover mapping, environment monitoring, and sustainable development.Driven by rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL) has emerged as the mainstream tool for semantic segmentation and achieved many breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing.However, the existing DL-based methods mainly focus on unimodal visual data while ignoring the rich multimodal information involved in the real world, usually demonstrating weak reliability and generlization.Inspired by the success of Vision Transformers and large language models, we propose a novel metadata-collaborative multimodal segmentation network (MetaSegNet) that applies vision-language representation learning for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike the common model structure that only uses unimodal visual data, we extract the key characteristic (i.e. the climate zone) from freely available remote sensing image metadata and transfer it into knowledge-based text prompts via the generic ChatGPT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>Then, we construct an image encoder, a text encoder and a crossmodal attention fusion subnetwork to extract the image and text feature and apply image-text interaction.Benefiting from such a design, the proposed MetaSegNet demonstrates superior generalization and achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on the large-scale OpenEarthMap dataset (68.6% mIoU) and Potsdam dataset (93.3% mean F1 score) as well as LoveDA dataset (52.2% mIoU).</p>

                  <p>Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia, but remains a challenging research problem.Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle.Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage, but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion.Moreover, training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images.This motivates the introduction of MoSAR, a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images.We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets.This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation.We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters, producing relightable avatars.As a result, MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps, and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce a new dataset, named FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics, the first public dataset providing intrisic face attributes at scale (diffuse, specular, ambient occlusion and translucency maps) for a total of 10k subjects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The project website and the dataset are available on the following link: https://ubisoftlaforge.github.io/character/mosar <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span></p>

                  <p>Embedding Human and Articulated Object Interaction (HAOI) in 3D is an important direction for a deeper human activity understanding.Different from previous works that use parametric and CAD models to represent humans and objects, in this work, we propose a novel 3D geometric primitive-based language to encode both humans and objects.Given our new paradigm, humans and objects are all compositions of primitives instead of heterogeneous entities.Thus, mutual information learning may be achieved between the limited 3D data of humans and different object categories.Moreover, considering the simplicity of the expression and the richness of the information it contains, we choose the superquadric as the primitive representation.To explore an effective embedding of HAOI for the machine, we build a new benchmark on 3D HAOI consisting of primitives together with their images and propose a task requiring machines to recover 3D HAOI using primitives from images.Moreover, we propose a baseline of single-view 3D reconstruction on HAOI.We believe this primitive-based 3D HAOI representation would pave the way for 3D HAOI studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/p3haoi. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently emerged as a significant breakthrough in foundation models, demonstrating remarkable zero-shot performance in object segmentation tasks.While SAM is designed for generalization, it exhibits limitations in handling specific medical imaging tasks that require fine-structure segmentation or precise boundaries.In this paper, we focus on the task of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) short-axis view segmentation using the SAM foundation model.We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the impact of different prompting strategies (including bounding boxes, positive points, negative points, and their combinations) on segmentation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on two public datasets using the baseline model and models fine-tuned with varying amounts of annotated data, ranging from a limited number of volumes to a fully annotated dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>Our findings indicate that prompting strategies significantly influence segmentation performance.Combining positive points with either bounding boxes or negative points shows substantial benefits, but little to no benefit when combined simultaneously.We further observe that fine-tuning SAM with a few annotated volumes improves segmentation performance when properly prompted.Specifically, fine-tuning with bounding boxes has a positive impact, while fine-tuning without bounding boxes leads to worse results compared to baseline.</p>

                  <p>Cross-lingual cross-modal retrieval has garnered increasing attention recently, which aims to achieve the alignment between vision and target language (V-T) without using any annotated V-T data pairs.Current methods employ machine translation (MT) to construct pseudo-parallel data pairs, which are then used to learn a multi-lingual and multi-modal embedding space that aligns visual and target-language representations.However, the large heterogeneous gap between vision and text, along with the noise present in target language translations, poses significant challenges in effectively aligning their representations.To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, Cross-Lingual to Cross-Modal (CL2CM), which improves the alignment between vision and target language using cross-lingual transfer.This approach allows us to fully leverage the merits of multi-lingual pre-trained models (e.g., mBERT) and the benefits of the same modality structure, i.e., smaller gap, to provide reliable and comprehensive semantic correspondence (knowledge) for the cross-modal network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our proposed approach on two multilingual image-text datasets, Multi30K and MSCOCO, and one video-text dataset, VATEX. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and its high potential for large-scale retrieval.</p>

                  <p>A timely software update is vital to combat the increasing security vulnerabilities.However, some software vendors may secretly patch their vulnerabilities without creating CVE entries or even describing the security issue in their change log.Thus, it is critical to identify these hidden security patches and defeat potential N-day attacks.Researchers have employed various machine learning techniques to identify security patches in open-source software, leveraging the syntax and semantic features of the software changes and commit messages.However, all these solutions cannot be directly applied to the binary code, whose instructions and program flow may dramatically vary due to different compilation configurations.In this paper, we propose BinGo, a new security patch detection system for binary code.The main idea is to present the binary code as code property graphs to enable a comprehensive understanding of program flow and perform a language model over each basic block of binary code to catch the instruction semantics.BinGo consists of four phases, namely, patch data pre-processing, graph extraction, embedding generation, and graph representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the lack of an existing binary security patch dataset, we construct such a dataset by compiling the pre-patch and post-patch source code of the Linux kernel. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.924</span></span>Our experimental results show BinGo can achieve up to 80.77% accuracy in identifying security patches between two neighboring versions of binary code.Moreover, BinGo can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives caused by the different compilers and optimization levels.</p>

                  <p>As the size of the datasets getting larger, accurately annotating such datasets is becoming more impractical due to the expensiveness on both time and economy.Therefore, crowd-sourcing has been widely adopted to alleviate the cost of collecting labels, which also inevitably introduces label noise and eventually degrades the performance of the model.To learn from crowd-sourcing annotations, modeling the expertise of each annotator is a common but challenging paradigm, because the annotations collected by crowd-sourcing are usually highly-sparse.To alleviate this problem, we propose Coupled Confusion Correction (CCC), where two models are simultaneously trained to correct the confusion matrices learned by each other.Via bi-level optimization, the confusion matrices learned by one model can be corrected by the distilled data from the other.Moreover, we cluster the ``annotator groups'' who share similar expertise so that their confusion matrices could be corrected together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this way, the expertise of the annotators, especially of those who provide seldom labels, could be better captured. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, we point out that the annotation sparsity not only means the average number of labels is low, but also there are always some annotators who provide very few labels, which is neglected by previous works when constructing synthetic crowd-sourcing annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Based on that, we propose to use Beta distribution to control the generation of the crowd-sourcing labels so that the synthetic annotations could be more consistent with the real-world ones.Extensive experiments are conducted on two types of synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets, the results of which demonstrate that CCC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>This paper examines the safety performance of the Waymo Driver, an SAE level 4 automated driving system (ADS) used in a rider-only (RO) ride-hailing application without a human driver, either in the vehicle or remotely.ADS crash data was derived from NHTSA's Standing General Order (SGO) reporting over 7.14 million RO miles through the end of October 2023 in Phoenix, AZ, San Francisco, CA, and Los Angeles, CA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study is one of the first to compare overall crashed vehicle rates using only RO data (as opposed to ADS testing with a human behind the wheel) to a human benchmark that also corrects for biases caused by underreporting and unequal reporting thresholds reported in the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>When considering all locations together, the any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rate was 0.41 incidents per million miles (IPMM) for the ADS vs 2.78 IPMM for the human benchmark, an 85% reduction or a 6.8 times lower rate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Police-reported crashed vehicle rates for all locations together were 2.1 IPMM for the ADS vs. 4.85 IPMM for the human benchmark, a 57% reduction or 2.3 times lower rate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Police-reported and any-injury-reported crashed vehicle rate reductions for the ADS were statistically significant when compared in San Francisco and Phoenix as well as combined across all locations.The comparison in Los Angeles, which to date has low mileage and no reported events, was not statistically significant.In general, the Waymo ADS had a lower any property damage or injury rate than the human benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given imprecision in the benchmark estimate and multiple potential sources of underreporting biasing the benchmarks, caution should be taken when interpreting the results of the any property damage or injury comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>Together, these crash-rate results should be interpreted as a directional and continuous confidence growth indicator, together with other methodologies, in a safety case approach.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) has shown remarkable success in cooperatively training deep models, while typically struggling with noisy labels.Advanced works propose to tackle label noise by a re-weighting strategy with a strong assumption, i.e., mild label noise.However, it may be violated in many real-world FL scenarios because of highly contaminated clients, resulting in extreme noise ratios, e.g., $>$90%.To tackle extremely noisy clients, we study the robustness of the re-weighting strategy, showing a pessimistic conclusion: minimizing the weight of clients trained over noisy data outperforms re-weighting strategies.To leverage models trained on noisy clients, we propose a novel approach, called negative distillation (FedNed).FedNed first identifies noisy clients and employs rather than discards the noisy clients in a knowledge distillation manner.In particular, clients identified as noisy ones are required to train models using noisy labels and pseudo-labels obtained by global models.The model trained on noisy labels serves as a `bad teacher' in knowledge distillation, aiming to decrease the risk of providing incorrect information.Meanwhile, the model trained on pseudo-labels is involved in model aggregation if not identified as a noisy client.Consequently, through pseudo-labeling, FedNed gradually increases the trustworthiness of models trained on noisy clients, while leveraging all clients for model aggregation through negative distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To verify the efficacy of FedNed, we conduct extensive experiments under various settings, demonstrating that FedNed can consistently outperform baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/linChen99/FedNed.</p>

                  <p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a very attractive and challenging research direction aiming to understand complex semantics of heterogeneous data from two domains, i.e., the spatio-temporal video content and the word sequence in question.Although various attention mechanisms have been utilized to manage contextualized representations by modeling intra- and inter-modal relationships of the two modalities, one limitation of the predominant VideoQA methods is the lack of reasoning with event correlation, that is, sensing and analyzing relationships among abundant and informative events contained in the video.In this paper, we introduce the dense caption modality as a new auxiliary and distill event-correlated information from it to infer the correct answer.To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable model, Event-Correlated Graph Neural Networks (EC-GNNs), to perform cross-modal reasoning over information from the three modalities (i.e., caption, video, and question).Besides the exploitation of a brand new modality, we employ cross-modal reasoning modules for explicitly modeling inter-modal relationships and aggregating relevant information across different modalities, and we propose a question-guided self-adaptive multi-modal fusion module to collect the question-oriented and event-correlated evidence through multi-step reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our model on two widely-used benchmark datasets and conduct an ablation study to justify the effectiveness of each proposed component. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Capturing the underlying structural causal relations represented by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) has been a fundamental task in various AI disciplines.Causal DAG learning via the continuous optimization framework has recently achieved promising performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.However, most methods make strong assumptions of homoscedastic noise, i.e., exogenous noises have equal variances across variables, observations, or even both.The noises in real data usually violate both assumptions due to the biases introduced by different data collection processes.To address the issue of heteroscedastic noise, we introduce relaxed and implementable sufficient conditions, proving the identifiability of a general class of SEM subject to these conditions.Based on the identifiable general SEM, we propose a novel formulation for DAG learning that accounts for the variation in noise variance across variables and observations.We then propose an effective two-phase iterative DAG learning algorithm to address the increasing optimization difficulties and to learn a causal DAG from data with heteroscedastic variable noise under varying variance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show significant empirical gains of the proposed approaches over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>While providing machine learning model as a service to process users' inference requests, online applications can periodically upgrade the model utilizing newly collected data.Federated learning (FL) is beneficial for enabling the training of models across distributed clients while keeping the data locally.However, existing work has overlooked the coexistence of model training and inference under clients' limited resources.This paper focuses on the joint optimization of model training and inference to maximize inference performance at clients.Such an optimization faces several challenges.The first challenge is to characterize the clients' inference performance when clients may partially participate in FL.To resolve this challenge, we introduce a new notion of age of model (AoM) to quantify client-side model freshness, based on which we use FL's global model convergence error as an approximate measure of inference performance.The second challenge is the tight coupling among clients' decisions, including participation probability in FL, model download probability, and service rates.Toward the challenges, we propose an online problem approximation to reduce the problem complexity and optimize the resources to balance the needs of model training and inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the average inference accuracy by up to 12%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Task-free online continual learning (TF-CL) is a challenging problem where the model incrementally learns tasks without explicit task information.Although training with entire data from the past, present as well as future is considered as the gold standard, naive approaches in TF-CL with the current samples may be conflicted with learning with samples in the future, leading to catastrophic forgetting and poor plasticity.Thus, a proactive consideration of an unseen future sample in TF-CL becomes imperative.Motivated by this intuition, we propose a novel TF-CL framework considering future samples and show that injecting adversarial perturbations on both input data and decision-making is effective.Then, we propose a novel method named Doubly Perturbed Continual Learning (DPCL) to efficiently implement these input and decision-making perturbations.Specifically, for input perturbation, we propose an approximate perturbation method that injects noise into the input data as well as the feature vector and then interpolates the two perturbed samples.For decision-making process perturbation, we devise multiple stochastic classifiers.We also investigate a memory management scheme and learning rate scheduling reflecting our proposed double perturbations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by large margins on various TF-CL benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, diffusion models have gained popularity for their ability to generate higher-quality images in comparison to GAN models.However, like any other large generative models, these models require a huge amount of data, computational resources, and meticulous tuning for successful training.This poses a significant challenge, rendering it infeasible for most individuals.As a result, the research community has devised methods to leverage pre-trained unconditional diffusion models with additional guidance for the purpose of conditional image generative.These methods enable conditional image generations on diverse inputs and, most importantly, circumvent the need for training the diffusion model.In this paper, our objective is to reduce the time-required and computational overhead introduced by the addition of guidance in diffusion models -- while maintaining comparable image quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a set of methods based on our empirical analysis, demonstrating a reduction in computation time by approximately threefold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software debloating tools seek to improve the program security and performance by removing unnecessary code, called bloat.While many techniques have been proposed, several barriers to their adoption have emerged.Namely, debloating tools are highly specialized, making it difficult for adopters to find the right type of tool for their needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is further hindered by a lack of established metrics and comparative evaluations between tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>To close this gap, we surveyed of 10 years of debloating literature and several tools currently under commercial development to systematize the debloating ecosystem's knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then conducted a broad comparative evaluation of 10 debloating tools to determine their relative strengths and weaknesses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation, conducted on a diverse set of 20 benchmark programs, measures tools across 16 performance, security, correctness, and usability metrics.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Our evaluation surfaces several concerning findings that contradict the prevailing narrative in debloating literature.First, debloating tools lack the required maturity to be used on real-world software, evidenced by a slim 21% overall success rate for creating passable debloated versions of medium- and high-complexity benchmarks.Second, debloating tools struggle to produce sound and robust programs.Using our novel differential fuzzing tool, DIFFER, we discovered that only 13% of our debloating attempts produced a sound and robust debloated program.Finally, our results indicate that debloating tools typically do not improve the performance or security posture of debloated programs by a significant degree.We believe that our contributions in this paper will help potential adopters better understand the landscape of tools and will motivate future research and development of more capable debloating tools.To this end, we have made our benchmark set, data, and custom tools publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages heterogeneous data sources to interpret the complex nature of human sentiments.Despite significant progress in multimodal architecture design, the field lacks comprehensive regularization methods.This paper introduces PowMix, a versatile embedding space regularizer that builds upon the strengths of unimodal mixing-based regularization approaches and introduces novel algorithmic components that are specifically tailored to multimodal tasks.PowMix is integrated before the fusion stage of multimodal architectures and facilitates intra-modal mixing, such as mixing text with text, to act as a regularizer.PowMix consists of five components: 1) a varying number of generated mixed examples, 2) mixing factor reweighting, 3) anisotropic mixing, 4) dynamic mixing, and 5) cross-modal label mixing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimentation across benchmark MSA datasets and a broad spectrum of diverse architectural designs demonstrate the efficacy of PowMix, as evidenced by consistent performance improvements over baselines and existing mixing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>An in-depth ablation study highlights the critical contribution of each PowMix component and how they synergistically enhance performance.Furthermore, algorithmic analysis demonstrates how PowMix behaves in different scenarios, particularly comparing early versus late fusion architectures.Notably, PowMix enhances overall performance without sacrificing model robustness or magnifying text dominance.It also retains its strong performance in situations of limited data.Our findings position PowMix as a promising versatile regularization strategy for MSA.

                  <p>Semi-supervised action segmentation aims to perform frame-wise classification in long untrimmed videos, where only a fraction of videos in the training set have labels.Recent studies have shown the potential of contrastive learning in unsupervised representation learning using unlabelled data.However, learning the representation of each frame by unsupervised contrastive learning for action segmentation remains an open and challenging problem.In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Multi-level Contrast scheme with a Neighbourhood-Consistency-Aware unit (SMC-NCA) to extract strong frame-wise representations for semi-supervised action segmentation.Specifically, for representation learning, SMC is firstly used to explore intra- and inter-information variations in a unified and contrastive way, based on dynamic clustering process of the original input, encoded semantic and temporal features.Then, the NCA module, which is responsible for enforcing spatial consistency between neighbourhoods centered at different frames to alleviate over-segmentation issues, works alongside SMC for semi-supervised learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our SMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, offering improvements of up to 17.8% and 12.6% in terms of edit distance and accuracy, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>Additionally, the NCA unit results in significant better segmentation performance against the others in the presence of only 5% labelled videos.We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on our Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset.The code and datasets will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Issue resolution and bug-fixing processes are essential in the development of machine-learning libraries, similar to software development, to ensure well-optimized functions.Understanding the issue resolution and bug-fixing process of machine-learning libraries can help developers identify areas for improvement and optimize their strategies for issue resolution and bug-fixing.However, detailed studies on this topic are lacking.Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of issue resolution for bug-fixing processes in six machine-learning libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, Pytorch, Caffe, and Scikit-learn.We addressed seven research questions (RQs) using 16,921 issues extracted from the GitHub repository via the GitHub Rest API.We employed several quantitative methods of data analysis, including correlation, OLS regression, percentage and frequency count, and heatmap to analyze the RQs.We found the following through our empirical investigation: (1) The most common categories of issues that arise in machine-learning libraries are bugs, documentation, optimization, crashes, enhancement, new feature requests, build/CI, support, and performance.(2) Effective strategies for addressing these problems include fixing critical bugs, optimizing performance, and improving documentation.(3) These categorized issues are related to testing and runtime and are common among all six machine-learning libraries.(4) Monitoring the total number of comments on issues can provide insights into the duration of the issues.(5) It is crucial to strike a balance between prioritizing critical issues and addressing other issues in a timely manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, this study concludes that efficient issue-tracking processes, effective communication, and collaboration are vital for effective resolution of issues and bug fixing processes in machine-learning libraries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>
