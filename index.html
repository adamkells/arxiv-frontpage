                  <p>The tool-use Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate with external Python interpreters have significantly enhanced mathematical reasoning capabilities for open-source LLMs, while tool-free methods chose another track: augmenting math reasoning data.However, a great method to integrate the above two research paths and combine their advantages remains to be explored.In this work, we firstly include new math questions via multi-perspective data augmenting methods and then synthesize code-nested solutions to them.The open LLMs (i.e., Llama-2) are finetuned on the augmented dataset to get the resulting models, MuMath-Code ($\mu$-Math-Code).During the inference phase, our MuMath-Code generates code and interacts with the external python interpreter to get the execution results.Therefore, MuMath-Code leverages the advantages of both the external tool and data augmentation.To fully leverage the advantages of our augmented data, we propose a two-stage training strategy: In Stage-1, we finetune Llama-2 on pure CoT data to get an intermediate model, which then is trained on the code-nested data in Stage-2 to get the resulting MuMath-Code.Our MuMath-Code-7B achieves 83.8 on GSM8K and 52.4 on MATH, while MuMath-Code-70B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance among open methods -- achieving 90.7% on GSM8K and 55.1% on MATH.Extensive experiments validate the combination of tool use and data augmentation, as well as our two-stage training strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the proposed dataset along with the associated code for public use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.927</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection in distributed systems such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters is vital for early fault detection, performance optimisation, security monitoring, reliability in general but also operational insights.Deep Neural Networks have seen successful use in detecting long-term anomalies in multidimensional data, originating for instance from industrial or medical systems, or weather prediction.A downside of such methods is that they require a static input size, or lose data through cropping, sampling, or other dimensionality reduction methods, making deployment on systems with variability on monitored data channels, such as computing clusters difficult.To address these problems, we present DeepHYDRA (Deep Hybrid DBSCAN/Reduction-Based Anomaly Detection) which combines DBSCAN and learning-based anomaly detection.DBSCAN clustering is used to find point anomalies in time-series data, mitigating the risk of missing outliers through loss of information when reducing input data to a fixed number of channels.A deep learning-based time-series anomaly detection method is then applied to the reduced data in order to identify long-term outliers.This hybrid approach reduces the chances of missing anomalies that might be made indistinguishable from normal data by the reduction process, and likewise enables the algorithm to be scalable and tolerate partial system failures while retaining its detection capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a subset of the well-known SMD dataset family, a modified variant of the Eclipse dataset, as well as an in-house dataset with a large variability in active data channels, made publicly available with this work, we furthermore analyse computational intensity, memory footprint, and activation counts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>DeepHYDRA is shown to reliably detect different types of anomalies in both large and complex datasets.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour.A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>

                  <p>We present and tackle the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) with Situational Queries (S-EQA) in a household environment.Unlike prior EQA work tackling simple queries that directly reference target objects and quantifiable properties pertaining them, EQA with situational queries (such as "Is the bathroom clean and dry?") is more challenging, as the agent needs to figure out not just what the target objects pertaining to the query are, but also requires a consensus on their states to be answerable.Towards this objective, we first introduce a novel Prompt-Generate-Evaluate (PGE) scheme that wraps around an LLM's output to create a dataset of unique situational queries, corresponding consensus object information, and predicted answers.PGE maintains uniqueness among the generated queries, using multiple forms of semantic similarity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the generated dataset via a large scale user-study conducted on M-Turk, and introduce it as S-EQA, the first dataset tackling EQA with situational queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Our user study establishes the authenticity of S-EQA with a high 97.26% of the generated queries being deemed answerable, given the consensus object data.Conversely, we observe a low correlation of 46.2% on the LLM-predicted answers to human-evaluated ones; indicating the LLM's poor capability in directly answering situational queries, while establishing S-EQA's usability in providing a human-validated consensus for an indirect solution.We evaluate S-EQA via Visual Question Answering (VQA) on VirtualHome, which unlike other simulators, contains several objects with modifiable states that also visually appear different upon modification -- enabling us to set a quantitative benchmark for S-EQA.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce EQA with situational queries, and also the first to use a generative approach for query creation.</p>

In this paper, we present an algorithmic framework OReO that makes online reorganization decisions to balance the benefits of improved query performance with the costs of reorganization.Our framework extends results from Metrical Task Systems to provide a tight bound on the worst-case performance guarantee for online reorganization, without prior knowledge of the query workload.Through evaluation on real-world datasets and query workloads, our experiments demonstrate that online reorganization with OReO can lead to an up to 32% improvement in combined query and reorganization time compared to using a single, optimized data layout for the entire workload.</p>

                  <p>Mapping agencies are increasingly adopting Aerial Lidar Scanning (ALS) as a new tool to monitor territory and support public policies.Processing ALS data at scale requires efficient point classification methods that perform well over highly diverse territories.To evaluate them, researchers need large annotated Lidar datasets, however, current Lidar benchmark datasets have restricted scope and often cover a single urban area.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this data gap, we present the FRench ALS Clouds from TArgeted Landscapes (FRACTAL) dataset: an ultra-large-scale aerial Lidar dataset made of 100,000 dense point clouds with high-quality labels for 7 semantic classes and spanning 250 km$^2$. FRACTAL is built upon France's nationwide open Lidar data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>It achieves spatial and semantic diversity via a sampling scheme that explicitly concentrates rare classes and challenging landscapes from five French regions.It should support the development of 3D deep learning approaches for large-scale land monitoring.We describe the nature of the source data, the sampling workflow, the content of the resulting dataset, and provide an initial evaluation of segmentation performance using a performant 3D neural architecture.</p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in handling complex queries, much of the past work has depended on extensively annotated datasets by human experts.However, this reliance on fully-supervised annotations poses scalability challenges, particularly as models and data requirements grow.To mitigate this, we explore the potential of enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with minimal human supervision.In this work, we introduce self-reinforcement, which begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the model using a small collection of annotated questions.Then it iteratively improves LLMs by learning from the differences in responses from the SFT and unfinetuned models on unlabeled questions.Our approach provides an efficient approach without relying heavily on extensive human-annotated explanations.However, current reasoning benchmarks typically only include golden-reference answers or rationales.Therefore, we present \textsc{PuzzleBen}, a weakly supervised benchmark that comprises 25,147 complex questions, answers, and human-generated rationales across various domains, such as brainteasers, puzzles, riddles, parajumbles, and critical reasoning tasks.A unique aspect of our dataset is the inclusion of 10,000 unannotated questions, enabling us to explore utilizing fewer supersized data to boost LLMs' inference capabilities.Our experiments underscore the significance of \textsc{PuzzleBen}, as well as the effectiveness of our methodology as a promising direction in future endeavors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code will be published soon on \texttt{Anonymity Link}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose: Autonomous navigation of devices in endovascular interventions can decrease operation times, improve decision-making during surgery, and reduce operator radiation exposure while increasing access to treatment.This systematic review explores recent literature to assess the impact, challenges, and opportunities artificial intelligence (AI) has for the autonomous endovascular intervention navigation.   Methods: PubMed and IEEEXplore databases were queried.Eligibility criteria included studies investigating the use of AI in enabling the autonomous navigation of catheters/guidewires in endovascular interventions.Following PRISMA, articles were assessed using QUADAS-2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PROSPERO: CRD42023392259.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span>Results:Among 462 studies, fourteen met inclusion criteria.Reinforcement learning (9/14, 64%) and learning from demonstration (7/14, 50%) were used as data-driven models for autonomous navigation.Studies predominantly utilised physical phantoms (10/14, 71%) and in silico (4/14, 29%) models.Experiments within or around the blood vessels of the heart were reported by the majority of studies (10/14, 71%), while simple non-anatomical vessel platforms were used in three studies (3/14, 21%), and the porcine liver venous system in one study.We observed that risk of bias and poor generalisability were present across studies.No procedures were performed on patients in any of the studies reviewed.Studies lacked patient selection criteria, reference standards, and reproducibility, resulting in low clinical evidence levels.   Conclusions: AI's potential in autonomous endovascular navigation is promising, but in an experimental proof-of-concept stage, with a technology readiness level of 3.We highlight that reference standards with well-identified performance metrics are crucial to allow for comparisons of data-driven algorithms proposed in the years to come.</p>

                  <p>The advent of data-driven weather forecasting models, which learn from hundreds of terabytes (TB) of reanalysis data, has significantly advanced forecasting capabilities.However, the substantial costs associated with data storage and transmission present a major challenge for data providers and users, affecting resource-constrained researchers and limiting their accessibility to participate in AI-based meteorological research.To mitigate this issue, we introduce an efficient neural codec, the Variational Autoencoder Transformer (VAEformer), for extreme compression of climate data to significantly reduce data storage cost, making AI-based meteorological research portable to researchers.Our approach diverges from recent complex neural codecs by utilizing a low-complexity Auto-Encoder transformer.This encoder produces a quantized latent representation through variance inference, which reparameterizes the latent space as a Gaussian distribution.This method improves the estimation of distributions for cross-entropy coding.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VAEformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art compression methods in the context of climate data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By applying our VAEformer, we compressed the most popular ERA5 climate dataset (226 TB) into a new dataset, CRA5 (0.7 TB). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>This translates to a compression ratio of over 300 while retaining the dataset's utility for accurate scientific analysis.Further, downstream experiments show that global weather forecasting models trained on the compact CRA5 dataset achieve forecasting accuracy comparable to the model trained on the original dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, the CRA5 dataset, and the pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/taohan10200/CRA5. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.886</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite notable successes of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the prevalent use of an online learning paradigm prevents its widespread adoption, especially in hazardous or costly scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Offline RL has emerged as an alternative solution, learning from pre-collected static datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>However, this offline learning introduces a new challenge known as distributional shift, degrading the performance when the policy is evaluated on scenarios that are Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) from the training dataset.Most existing offline RL resolves this issue by regularizing policy learning within the information supported by the given dataset.However, such regularization overlooks the potential for high-reward regions that may exist beyond the dataset.This motivates exploring novel offline learning techniques that can make improvements beyond the data support without compromising policy performance, potentially by learning causation (cause-and-effect) instead of correlation from the dataset.In this paper, we propose the MOOD-CRL (Model-based Offline OOD-Adapting Causal RL) algorithm, which aims to address the challenge of extrapolation for offline policy training through causal inference instead of policy-regularizing methods.Specifically, Causal Normalizing Flow (CNF) is developed to learn the transition and reward functions for data generation and augmentation in offline policy evaluation and training.Based on the data-invariant, physics-based qualitative causal graph and the observational data, we develop a novel learning scheme for CNF to learn the quantitative structural causal model.As a result, CNF gains predictive and counterfactual reasoning capabilities for sequential decision-making tasks, revealing a high potential for OOD adaptation.Our CNF-based offline RL approach is validated through empirical evaluations, outperforming model-free and model-based methods by a significant margin.</p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting.Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners.However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons.First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency.Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited.In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions.To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes.Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes.Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP.By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance.Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p>

                  <p>Sign Language Production (SLP) is a challenging task, given the limited resources available and the inherent diversity within sign data.As a result, previous works have suffered from the problem of regression to the mean, leading to under-articulated and incomprehensible signing.In this paper, we propose using dictionary examples and a learnt codebook of facial expressions to create expressive sign language sequences.However, simply concatenating signs and adding the face creates robotic and unnatural sequences.To address this we present a 7-step approach to effectively stitch sequences together.First, by normalizing each sign into a canonical pose, cropping, and stitching we create a continuous sequence.Then, by applying filtering in the frequency domain and resampling each sign, we create cohesive natural sequences that mimic the prosody found in the original data.We leverage a SignGAN model to map the output to a photo-realistic signer and present a complete Text-to-Sign (T2S) SLP pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across all datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Finally, a user evaluation shows our approach outperforms the baseline model and is capable of producing realistic sign language sequences.</p>

                  <p>Integrating the different data modalities of cancer patients can significantly improve the predictive performance of patient survival.However, most existing methods ignore the simultaneous utilization of rich semantic features at different scales in pathology images.When collecting multimodal data and extracting features, there is a likelihood of encountering intra-modality missing data, introducing noise into the multimodal data.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new end-to-end framework, FORESEE, for robustly predicting patient survival by mining multimodal information.Specifically, the cross-fusion transformer effectively utilizes features at the cellular level, tissue level, and tumor heterogeneity level to correlate prognosis through a cross-scale feature cross-fusion method.This enhances the ability of pathological image feature representation.Secondly, the hybrid attention encoder (HAE) uses the denoising contextual attention module to obtain the contextual relationship features and local detail features of the molecular data.HAE's channel attention module obtains global features of molecular data.Furthermore, to address the issue of missing information within modalities, we propose an asymmetrically masked triplet masked autoencoder to reconstruct lost information within modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets in both complete and missing settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Decentralized learning (DL) faces increased vulnerability to privacy breaches due to sophisticated attacks on machine learning (ML) models.Secure aggregation is a computationally efficient cryptographic technique that enables multiple parties to compute an aggregate of their private data while keeping their individual inputs concealed from each other and from any central aggregator.To enhance communication efficiency in DL, sparsification techniques are used, selectively sharing only the most crucial parameters or gradients in a model, thereby maintaining efficiency without notably compromising accuracy.However, applying secure aggregation to sparsified models in DL is challenging due to the transmission of disjoint parameter sets by distinct nodes, which can prevent masks from canceling out effectively.This paper introduces CESAR, a novel secure aggregation protocol for DL designed to be compatible with existing sparsification mechanisms.CESAR provably defends against honest-but-curious adversaries and can be formally adapted to counteract collusion between them.We provide a foundational understanding of the interaction between the sparsification carried out by the nodes and the proportion of the parameters shared under CESAR in both colluding and non-colluding environments, offering analytical insight into the working and applicability of the protocol.Experiments on a network with 48 nodes in a 3-regular topology show that with random subsampling, CESAR is always within 0.5% accuracy of decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent (D-PSGD), while adding only 11% of data overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it surpasses the accuracy on TopK by up to 0.3% on independent and identically distributed (IID) data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

The matrix sketching problem becomes particularly interesting in the context of sliding windows, where the goal is to approximate the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}_W$, formed by input vectors over the most recent $N$ time units.However, despite recent efforts, whether achieving the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound on sliding windows is possible has remained an open question.   In this paper, we introduce the DS-FD algorithm, which achieves the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound for matrix sketching over row-normalized, sequence-based sliding windows.We also present matching upper and lower space bounds for time-based and unnormalized sliding windows, demonstrating the generality and optimality of \dsfd across various sliding window models.This conclusively answers the open question regarding the optimal space bound for matrix sketching over sliding windows.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating our theoretical claims and thus confirming the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithm, both theoretically and empirically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>The ever-increasing use of generative models in various fields where tabular data is used highlights the need for robust and standardized validation metrics to assess the similarity between real and synthetic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Current methods lack a unified framework and rely on diverse and often inconclusive statistical measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Divergences, which quantify discrepancies between data distributions, offer a promising avenue for validation.However, traditional approaches calculate divergences independently for each feature due to the complexity of joint distribution modeling.This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel approach that uses divergence estimation to overcome the limitations of marginal comparisons.Our core contribution lies in applying a divergence estimator to build a validation metric considering the joint distribution of real and synthetic data.We leverage a probabilistic classifier to approximate the density ratio between datasets, allowing the capture of complex relationships.We specifically calculate two divergences: the well-known Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence.KL divergence offers an established use in the field, while JS divergence is symmetric and bounded, providing a reliable metric.The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments with varying distribution complexities.The initial phase involves comparing estimated divergences with analytical solutions for simple distributions, setting a benchmark for accuracy.Finally, we validate our method on a real-world dataset and its corresponding synthetic counterpart, showcasing its effectiveness in practical applications.This research offers a significant contribution with applicability beyond tabular data and the potential to improve synthetic data validation in various fields.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large-scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI).To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed.It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process.The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation.It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation.The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making.Our contributions are two folder.First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection.Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations.The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance.However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes.It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance.To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them.We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence.We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper proposes a navigation method considering blind spots based on the robot operating system (ROS) navigation stack and blind spots layer (BSL) for a wheeled mobile robot.In this paper, environmental information is recognized using a laser range finder (LRF) and RGB-D cameras.Blind spots occur when corners or obstacles are present in the environment, and may lead to collisions if a human or object moves toward the robot from these blind spots.To prevent such collisions, this paper proposes a navigation method considering blind spots based on the local cost map layer of the BSL for the wheeled mobile robot.Blind spots are estimated by utilizing environmental data collected through RGB-D cameras.The navigation method that takes these blind spots into account is achieved through the implementation of the BSL and a local path planning method that employs an enhanced cost function of dynamic window approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method was further demonstrated through simulations and experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a robust version of the well-known exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) technique, named ReLORETA, to localize brain sources in the presence of different forward model uncertainties.Methods: We first assume that the true lead field matrix is a transformation of the existing lead field matrix distorted by uncertainties and propose an iterative approach to estimate this transformation accurately.Major sources of the forward model uncertainties, including differences in geometry, conductivity, and source space resolution between the real and simulated head models, and misaligned electrode positions, are then simulated to test the proposed method.Results: ReLORETA and eLORETA are applied to simulated focal sources in different regions of the brain and the presence of various noise levels as well as real data from a patient with focal epilepsy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that ReLORETA is considerably more robust and accurate than eLORETA in all cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Conclusion: Having successfully dealt with the forward model uncertainties, ReLORETA proved to be a promising method for real-world clinical applications.Significance: eLORETA is one of the localization techniques that could be used to study brain activity for medical applications such as determining the epileptogenic zone in patients with medically refractory epilepsy.However, the major limitation of eLORETA is sensitivity to the uncertainties in the forward model.Since this problem can substantially undermine its performance in real-world applications where the exact lead field matrix is unknown, developing a more robust method capable of dealing with these uncertainties is of significant interest.</p>

                  <p>We present a new class of preconditioned iterative methods for solving linear systems of the form $Ax = b$. Our methods are based on constructing a low-rank Nystr\"om approximation to $A$ using sparse random sketching.This approximation is used to construct a preconditioner, which itself is inverted quickly using additional levels of random sketching and preconditioning.We prove that the convergence of our methods depends on a natural average condition number of $A$, which improves as the rank of the Nystr\"om approximation increases.Concretely, this allows us to obtain faster runtimes for a number of fundamental linear algebraic problems:   1.We show how to solve any $n\times n$ linear system that is well-conditioned except for $k$ outlying large singular values in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.065} + k^\omega)$ time, improving on a recent result of [Derezi\'nski, Yang, STOC 2024] for all $k \gtrsim n^{0.78}$.   2.We give the first $\tilde{O}(n^2 + {d_\lambda}^{\omega}$) time algorithm for solving a regularized linear system $(A + \lambda I)x= b$, where $A$ is positive semidefinite with effective dimension $d_\lambda$. This problem arises in applications like Gaussian process regression.   3.We give faster algorithms for approximating Schatten $p$-norms and other matrix norms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, for the Schatten 1 (nuclear) norm, we give an algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.11})$ time, improving on an $\tilde{O}(n^{2.18})$ method of [Musco et al., ITCS 2018].    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Interestingly, previous state-of-the-art algorithms for most of the problems above relied on stochastic iterative methods, like stochastic coordinate and gradient descent.Our work takes a completely different approach, instead leveraging tools from matrix sketching.</p>

                  <p>We study fundamental directed graph (digraph) problems in the streaming model.An initial investigation by Chakrabarti, Ghosh, McGregor, and Vorotnikova [SODA'20] on streaming digraphs showed that while most of these problems are provably hard in general, some of them become tractable when restricted to the well-studied class of tournament graphs where every pair of nodes shares exactly one directed edge.Thus, we focus on tournaments and improve the state of the art for multiple problems in terms of both upper and lower bounds.   Our primary upper bound is a deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm (using $\tilde{O}(n)$ space for $n$-node graphs, where $\tilde{O}(.)$ hides polylog$(n)$ factors) for decomposing a tournament into strongly connected components (SCC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>it improves upon the previously best-known algorithm by Baweja, Jia, and Woodruff <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>[ITCS'22] in terms of both space and passes: for $p\geq 1$, they used $(p+1)$-passes and $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/p})$-space.We further extend our algorithm to digraphs that are close to tournaments and establish tight bounds demonstrating that the problem's complexity grows smoothly with the "distance" from tournaments.Applying our framework, we obtain improved tournament algorithms for $s,t$-reachability, strong connectivity, Hamiltonian paths and cycles, and feedback arc set.   On the other hand, we prove the first $\Omega(n^2)$-space lower bounds for this class, exhibiting that some well-studied problems -- such as (exact) feedback arc set on tournaments (FAST) and $s,t$-distance -- remain hard here.We obtain a generalized lower bound on space-approximation tradeoffs for FAST: any single-pass $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm requires $\Omega(n/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ space.As a whole, our collection of results contributes significantly to the growing literature on streaming digraphs.</p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>

                  <p>Linking (aligning) biomedical concepts across diverse data sources enables various integrative analyses, but it is challenging due to the discrepancies in concept naming conventions.Various strategies have been developed to overcome this challenge, such as those based on string-matching rules, manually crafted thesauri, and machine learning models.However, these methods are constrained by limited prior biomedical knowledge and can hardly generalize beyond the limited amounts of rules, thesauri, or training samples.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive results in diverse biomedical NLP tasks due to their unprecedentedly rich prior knowledge and strong zero-shot prediction abilities.However, LLMs suffer from issues including high costs, limited context length, and unreliable predictions.In this research, we propose PromptLink, a novel biomedical concept linking framework that leverages LLMs.It first employs a biomedical-specialized pre-trained language model to generate candidate concepts that can fit in the LLM context windows.Then it utilizes an LLM to link concepts through two-stage prompts, where the first-stage prompt aims to elicit the biomedical prior knowledge from the LLM for the concept linking task and the second-stage prompt enforces the LLM to reflect on its own predictions to further enhance their reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results on the concept linking task between two EHR datasets and an external biomedical KG demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptLink. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, PromptLink is a generic framework without reliance on additional prior knowledge, context, or training data, making it well-suited for concept linking across various types of data sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/constantjxyz/PromptLink.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly essential in processing natural languages, yet their application is frequently compromised by biases and inaccuracies originating in their training data.In this study, we introduce Cross-Care, the first benchmark framework dedicated to assessing biases and real world knowledge in LLMs, specifically focusing on the representation of disease prevalence across diverse demographic groups.We systematically evaluate how demographic biases embedded in pre-training corpora like $ThePile$ influence the outputs of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We expose and quantify discrepancies by juxtaposing these biases against actual disease prevalences in various U.S. demographic groups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>Our results highlight substantial misalignment between LLM representation of disease prevalence and real disease prevalence rates across demographic subgroups, indicating a pronounced risk of bias propagation and a lack of real-world grounding for medical applications of LLMs.Furthermore, we observe that various alignment methods minimally resolve inconsistencies in the models' representation of disease prevalence across different languages.For further exploration and analysis, we make all data and a data visualization tool available at: www.crosscare.net.</p>

                  <p>The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric.With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance.These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation).Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios.The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates.Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it.This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span></p>

We present Carbon Filter, a statistical learning based system that dramatically reduces the number of alerts analysts need to manually review.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is based on the observation that false alert triggers can be efficiently identified and separated from suspicious behaviors by examining the process initiation context (e.g., the command line) that launched the responsible process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>Through the use of fast-search algorithms for training and inference, our approach scales to millions of alerts per day.Through batching queries to the model, we observe a theoretical maximum throughput of 20 million alerts per hour.Based on the analysis of tens of million alerts from customer deployments, our solution resulted in a 6-fold improvement in the Signal-to-Noise ratio without compromising on alert triage performance.</p>

                  <p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors.Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs.To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN).Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner.Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources.Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments.Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Aligning machine learning systems with human expectations is mostly attempted by training with manually vetted human behavioral samples, typically explicit feedback.This is done on a population level since the context that is capturing the subjective Point-Of-View (POV) of a concrete person in a specific situational context is not retained in the data.However, we argue that alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably.Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed differently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent reasoning processes and observable reactions differ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>We hypothesize that individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an individual level.We test this, by integrating perception information into machine learning systems and measuring their predictive performance wrt.~individual subjective assessments.For our empirical study, we collect a novel data set of multimodal stimuli and corresponding eye tracking sequences for the novel task of Perception-Guided Crossmodal Entailment and tackle it with our Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer.Our findings suggest that exploiting individual perception signals for the machine learning of subjective human assessments provides a valuable cue for individual alignment.It does not only improve the overall predictive performance from the point-of-view of the individual user but might also contribute to steering AI systems towards every person's individual expectations and values.</p>

                  <p>Apportionment is the act of distributing the seats of a legislature among political parties (or states) in proportion to their vote shares (or populations).A famous impossibility by Balinski and Young (2001) shows that no apportionment method can be proportional up to one seat (quota) while also responding monotonically to changes in the votes (population monotonicity).Grimmett (2004) proposed to overcome this impossibility by randomizing the apportionment, which can achieve quota as well as perfect proportionality and monotonicity -- at least in terms of the expected number of seats awarded to each party.Still, the correlations between the seats awarded to different parties may exhibit bizarre non-monotonicities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When parties or voters care about joint events, such as whether a coalition of parties reaches a majority, these non-monotonicities can cause paradoxes, including incentives for strategic voting.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>In this paper, we propose monotonicity axioms ruling out these paradoxes, and study which of them can be satisfied jointly with Grimmett's axioms.Essentially, we require that, if a set of parties all receive more votes, the probability of those parties jointly receiving more seats should increase.Our work draws on a rich literature on unequal probability sampling in statistics (studied as dependent randomized rounding in computer science).Our main result shows that a sampling scheme due to Sampford (1967) satisfies Grimmett's axioms and a notion of higher-order correlation monotonicity.</p>

                  <p>Despite notable successes of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the prevalent use of an online learning paradigm prevents its widespread adoption, especially in hazardous or costly scenarios.Offline RL has emerged as an alternative solution, learning from pre-collected static datasets.However, this offline learning introduces a new challenge known as distributional shift, degrading the performance when the policy is evaluated on scenarios that are Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) from the training dataset.Most existing offline RL resolves this issue by regularizing policy learning within the information supported by the given dataset.However, such regularization overlooks the potential for high-reward regions that may exist beyond the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This motivates exploring novel offline learning techniques that can make improvements beyond the data support without compromising policy performance, potentially by learning causation (cause-and-effect) instead of correlation from the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose the MOOD-CRL (Model-based Offline OOD-Adapting Causal RL) algorithm, which aims to address the challenge of extrapolation for offline policy training through causal inference instead of policy-regularizing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.579</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, Causal Normalizing Flow (CNF) is developed to learn the transition and reward functions for data generation and augmentation in offline policy evaluation and training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the data-invariant, physics-based qualitative causal graph and the observational data, we develop a novel learning scheme for CNF to learn the quantitative structural causal model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>As a result, CNF gains predictive and counterfactual reasoning capabilities for sequential decision-making tasks, revealing a high potential for OOD adaptation.Our CNF-based offline RL approach is validated through empirical evaluations, outperforming model-free and model-based methods by a significant margin.</p>

                  <p>Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques.However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance.In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases.Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results.To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs.In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images.This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization.Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely.The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively.This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks.It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.591</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML).The interest is driven by the numerous situations in real-life applications where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously.A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which illustrates the inherent trade-offs between objectives.Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature that could serve as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners who want to use MOO.Hence, our goal in this paper is to produce such a resource.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We critically review previous studies, particularly those involving MOO in deep learning (using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a guiding example), and identify misconceptions that highlight the need for a better grasp of MOO principles in ML. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.569</span></span>Using MOO of PINNs as a case study, we demonstrate the interplay between the data loss and the physics loss terms.We highlight the most common pitfalls one should avoid while using MOO techniques in ML.We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more complex techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA).Additionally, we compare the results obtained from the WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II.We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence can result in inaccurate outcomes and, consequently, a non-optimal solution.Our goal is to offer a clear and practical guide for ML practitioners to effectively apply MOO, particularly in the context of DL.</p>

                  <p>Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques.However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance.In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases.Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results.To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs.In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images.This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization.Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely.The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively.This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks.It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

In this work, we thoroughly investigate whether VLP models are commonly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations of a specific pattern for the image modality.To this end, we propose a novel black-box method to generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which is so called the Effective and T ransferable Universal Adversarial Attack (ETU), aiming to mislead a variety of existing VLP models in a range of downstream tasks.The ETU comprehensively takes into account the characteristics of UAPs and the intrinsic cross-modal interactions to generate effective UAPs.Under this regime, the ETU encourages both global and local utilities of UAPs.This benefits the overall utility while reducing interactions between UAP units, improving the transferability.To further enhance the effectiveness and transferability of UAPs, we also design a novel data augmentation method named ScMix.ScMix consists of self-mix and cross-mix data transformations, which can effectively increase the multi-modal data diversity while preserving the semantics of the original data.Through comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve effective and transferrable universal adversarial attacks.</p>

                  <p>Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details.In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions.By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions.This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference.Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens.This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model.Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span></p>

                  <p>The search for refining 3D LiDAR data has attracted growing interest motivated by recent techniques such as supervised learning or generative model-based methods.Existing approaches have shown the possibilities for using diffusion models to generate refined LiDAR data with high fidelity, although the performance and speed of such methods have been limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These limitations make it difficult to execute in real-time, causing the approaches to struggle in real-world tasks such as autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on conditional diffusion models for fast and high-quality sparse-to-dense upsampling of 3D scene point clouds through an image representation.Our method employs denoising diffusion probabilistic models trained with conditional inpainting masks, which have been shown to give high performance on image completion tasks.We introduce a series of experiments, including multiple datasets, sampling steps, and conditional masks, to determine the ideal configuration, striking a balance between performance and inference speed.This paper illustrates that our method outperforms the baselines in sampling speed and quality on upsampling tasks using the KITTI-360 dataset.Furthermore, we illustrate the generalization ability of our approach by simultaneously training on real-world and synthetic datasets, introducing variance in quality and environments.</p>

                  <p>Current autonomous driving systems heavily rely on V2X communication data to enhance situational awareness and the cooperation between vehicles.However, a major challenge when using V2X data is that it may not be available periodically because of unpredictable delays and data loss during wireless transmission between road stations and the receiver vehicle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This issue should be considered when designing control strategies for connected and autonomous vehicles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>Therefore, this paper proposes a novel 'Blind Actor-Critic' algorithm that guarantees robust driving performance in V2X environment with delayed and/or lost data.The novel algorithm incorporates three key mechanisms: a virtual fixed sampling period, a combination of Temporal-Difference and Monte Carlo learning, and a numerical approximation of immediate reward values.To address the temporal aperiodicity problem of V2X data, we first illustrate this challenge.Then, we provide a detailed explanation of the Blind Actor-Critic algorithm where we highlight the proposed components to compensate for the temporal aperiodicity problem of V2X data.We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in a simulation environment and compare it to benchmark approaches.The results demonstrate that training metrics are improved compared to conventional actor-critic algorithms.Additionally, testing results show that our approach provides robust control, even under low V2X network reliability levels.</p>

                  <p>Aligning machine learning systems with human expectations is mostly attempted by training with manually vetted human behavioral samples, typically explicit feedback.This is done on a population level since the context that is capturing the subjective Point-Of-View (POV) of a concrete person in a specific situational context is not retained in the data.However, we argue that alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably.Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed differently.Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent reasoning processes and observable reactions differ.We hypothesize that individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an individual level.We test this, by integrating perception information into machine learning systems and measuring their predictive performance wrt.~individual subjective assessments.For our empirical study, we collect a novel data set of multimodal stimuli and corresponding eye tracking sequences for the novel task of Perception-Guided Crossmodal Entailment and tackle it with our Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer.Our findings suggest that exploiting individual perception signals for the machine learning of subjective human assessments provides a valuable cue for individual alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It does not only improve the overall predictive performance from the point-of-view of the individual user but might also contribute to steering AI systems towards every person's individual expectations and values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span></p>
