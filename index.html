                  <p>The recent development of online static map element (a.k.a. HD map) construction algorithms has raised a vast demand for data with ground truth annotations.However, available public datasets currently cannot provide high-quality training data regarding consistency and accuracy.For instance, the manual labelled (low efficiency)nuScenes still contains misalignment and inconsistency between the HD maps and images (e.g., around 8.03 pixels reprojection error on average).To this end, we present CAMAv2: a vision-centric approach for Consistent and Accurate Map Annotation.Without LiDAR inputs, our proposed framework can still generate high-quality 3D annotations of static map elements.Specifically, the annotation can achieve high reprojection accuracy across all surrounding cameras and is spatial-temporal consistent across the whole sequence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We apply our proposed framework to the popular nuScenes dataset to provide efficient and highly accurate annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.899</span></span>Compared with the original nuScenes static map element, our CAMAv2 annotations achieve lower reprojection errors (e.g., 4.96 vs. 8.03 pixels).Models trained with annotations from CAMAv2 also achieve lower reprojection errors (e.g., 5.62 vs. 8.43 pixels).</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancements of generative AI have fueled the potential of generative text image editing while simultaneously escalating the threat of misinformation spreading.However, existing forensics methods struggle to detect unseen forgery types that they have not been trained on, leaving the development of a model capable of generalized detection of tampered scene text as an unresolved issue.To tackle this, we propose a novel task: open-set tampered scene text detection, which evaluates forensics models on their ability to identify both seen and previously unseen forgery types.We have curated a comprehensive, high-quality dataset, featuring the texts tampered by eight text editing models, to thoroughly assess the open-set generalization capabilities.Further, we introduce a novel and effective pre-training paradigm that subtly alters the texture of selected texts within an image and trains the model to identify these regions.This approach not only mitigates the scarcity of high-quality training data but also enhances models' fine-grained perception and open-set generalization abilities.Additionally, we present DAF, a novel framework that improves open-set generalization by distinguishing between the features of authentic and tampered text, rather than focusing solely on the tampered text's features.Our extensive experiments validate the remarkable efficacy of our methods.For example, our zero-shot performance can even beat the previous state-of-the-art full-shot model by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code will be open-source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field of study that focuses on identifying and classifying human activities.Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has received much attention in recent years, where Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method is widely used and has achieved remarkable results.However, the representation of skeleton data and the issue of over-smoothing in GCN still need to be studied.1).Compared to central nodes, edge nodes can only aggregate limited neighbor information, and different edge nodes of the human body are always structurally related.However, the information from edge nodes is crucial for fine-grained activity recognition.2).The Graph Convolutional Network suffers from a significant over-smoothing issue, causing nodes to become increasingly similar as the number of network layers increases.Based on these two ideas, we propose a two-stream graph convolution method called Spatial-Structural GCN (SpSt-GCN).Spatial GCN performs information aggregation based on the topological structure of the human body, and structural GCN performs differentiation based on the similarity of edge node sequences.The spatial connection is fixed, and the human skeleton naturally maintains this topology regardless of the actions performed by humans.However, the structural connection is dynamic and depends on the type of movement the human body is performing.Based on this idea, we also propose an entirely data-driven structural connection, which greatly increases flexibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on two large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>The proposed method achieves good results while being efficient.</p>

                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets.Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the attention towards One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has been driven by its capacity to minimize communication.With the development of the diffusion model (DM), several methods employ the DM for OSFL, utilizing model parameters, image features, or textual prompts as mediums to transfer the local client knowledge to the server.However, these mediums often require public datasets or the uniform feature extractor, significantly limiting their practicality.In this paper, we propose FedDEO, a Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning Method with DMs, offering a novel exploration of utilizing the DM in OSFL.The core idea of our method involves training local descriptions on the clients, serving as the medium to transfer the knowledge of the distributed clients to the server.Firstly, we train local descriptions on the client data to capture the characteristics of client distributions, which are then uploaded to the server.On the server, the descriptions are used as conditions to guide the DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the distributions of various clients, enabling the training of the aggregated model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Theoretical analyses and sufficient quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that through the training of local descriptions, the server is capable of generating synthetic datasets with high quality and diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>Consequently, with advantages in communication and privacy protection, the aggregated model outperforms compared FL or diffusion-based OSFL methods and, on some clients, outperforms the performance ceiling of centralized training.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for closed-form computation and visualization of critical point uncertainty in 2D uncertain scalar fields.Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields.The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions.Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks.In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions.Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software.We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution.First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods.Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support.Second, we accelerate critical point probability computations using a parallel implementation with the VTK-m library, which is platform portable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate the integration of our implementation with the ParaView software system to demonstrate near-real-time results for real datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span></p>

                  <p>Small Video Object Detection (SVOD) is a crucial subfield in modern computer vision, essential for early object discovery and detection.However, existing SVOD datasets are scarce and suffer from issues such as insufficiently small objects, limited object categories, and lack of scene diversity, leading to unitary application scenarios for corresponding methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we develop the XS-VID dataset, which comprises aerial data from various periods and scenes, and annotates eight major object categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>To further evaluate existing methods for detecting extremely small objects, XS-VID extensively collects three types of objects with smaller pixel areas: extremely small (\textit{es}, $0\sim12^2$), relatively small (\textit{rs}, $12^2\sim20^2$), and generally small (\textit{gs}, $20^2\sim32^2$).XS-VID offers unprecedented breadth and depth in covering and quantifying minuscule objects, significantly enriching the scene and object diversity in the dataset.Extensive validations on XS-VID and the publicly available VisDrone2019VID dataset show that existing methods struggle with small object detection and significantly underperform compared to general object detectors.Leveraging the strengths of previous methods and addressing their weaknesses, we propose YOLOFT, which enhances local feature associations and integrates temporal motion features, significantly improving the accuracy and stability of SVOD.Our datasets and benchmarks are available at \url{https://gjhhust.github.io/XS-VID/}.</p>

                  <p>Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies.While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question.The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity.We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction).AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods.AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods.Based on this new dataset, we benchmarked various representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances are not satisfactory as expected for epitope prediction.We thus propose a new method, WALLE, that leverages both protein language models and graph neural networks.WALLE demonstrate about 5X performance gain over existing methods.Our empirical findings evidence that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential embeddings provided by language models and geometrical information from graph representations, providing a guideline for future method design.In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing easy model performance attribution and interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models have become cornerstone technologies, driving innovation in diverse fields from art creation to healthcare.Despite their potential, these models face the significant challenge of data memorization, which poses risks to privacy and the integrity of generated content.Among various metrics of memorization detection, our study delves into the memorization scores calculated from encoder layer embeddings, which involves measuring distances between samples in the embedding spaces.Particularly, we find that the memorization scores calculated from layer embeddings of Vision Transformers (ViTs) show an notable trend - the latter (deeper) the layer, the less the memorization measured.It has been found that the memorization scores from the early layers' embeddings are more sensitive to low-level memorization (e.g. colors and simple patterns for an image), while those from the latter layers are more sensitive to high-level memorization (e.g. semantic meaning of an image).We also observe that, for a specific model architecture, its degree of memorization on different levels of information is unique.It can be viewed as an inherent property of the architecture.Building upon this insight, we introduce a unique fingerprinting methodology.This method capitalizes on the unique distributions of the memorization score across different layers of ViTs, providing a novel approach to identifying models involved in generating deepfakes and malicious content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach demonstrates a marked 30% enhancement in identification accuracy over existing baseline methods, offering a more effective tool for combating digital misinformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the launch of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have attracted global attention.In the realm of article writing, LLMs have witnessed extensive utilization, giving rise to concerns related to intellectual property protection, personal privacy, and academic integrity.In response, AI-text detection has emerged to distinguish between human and machine-generated content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent research indicates that these detection systems often lack robustness and struggle to effectively differentiate perturbed texts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Currently, there is a lack of systematic evaluations regarding detection performance in real-world applications, and a comprehensive examination of perturbation techniques and detector robustness is also absent.To bridge this gap, our work simulates real-world scenarios in both informal and professional writing, exploring the out-of-the-box performance of current detectors.Additionally, we have constructed 12 black-box text perturbation methods to assess the robustness of current detection models across various perturbation granularities.Furthermore, through adversarial learning experiments, we investigate the impact of perturbation data augmentation on the robustness of AI-text detectors.We have released our code and data at https://github.com/zhouying20/ai-text-detector-evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Data assimilation has become a crucial technique aiming to combine physical models with observational data to estimate state variables.Traditional assimilation algorithms often face challenges of high nonlinearity brought by both the physical and observational models.In this work, we propose a novel data-driven assimilation algorithm based on generative models to address such concerns.Our State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is designed to handle nonlinear physical and observational models more effectively.The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the real posterior under mild assumptions, which shows theoretical superiority over previous score-based assimilation works.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results also indicate that our SOAD model may offer improved accuracy over existing data-driven methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Imagining potential outcomes of actions before execution helps agents make more informed decisions, a prospective thinking ability fundamental to human cognition.However, mainstream model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods lack the ability to proactively envision future scenarios, plan, and guide strategies.These methods typically rely on trial and error to adjust policy functions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards or long-term value, even if such high-reward decisions place the environment in extremely dangerous states.To address this, we propose the Prospective (ProSpec) RL method, which makes higher-value, lower-risk optimal decisions by imagining future n-stream trajectories.Specifically, ProSpec employs a dynamic model to predict future states (termed "imagined states") based on the current state and a series of sampled actions.Furthermore, we integrate the concept of Model Predictive Control and introduce a cycle consistency constraint that allows the agent to evaluate and select the optimal actions from these trajectories.Moreover, ProSpec employs cycle consistency to mitigate two fundamental issues in RL: augmenting state reversibility to avoid irreversible events (low risk) and augmenting actions to generate numerous virtual trajectories, thereby improving data efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validated the effectiveness of our method on the DMControl benchmarks, where our approach achieved significant performance improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>Code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Fine-grained sentiment analysis involves extracting and organizing sentiment elements from textual data.However, existing approaches often overlook issues of category semantic inclusion and overlap, as well as inherent structural patterns within the target sequence.This study introduces a generative sentiment analysis model.To address the challenges related to category semantic inclusion and overlap, a latent category distribution variable is introduced.By reconstructing the input of a variational autoencoder, the model learns the intensity of the relationship between categories and text, thereby improving sequence generation.Additionally, a trie data structure and constrained decoding strategy are utilized to exploit structural patterns, which in turn reduces the search space and regularizes the generation process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on the Restaurant-ACOS and Laptop-ACOS datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to baseline models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of latent category distribution and constrained decoding strategy.</p>

                  <p>Mix-up is a key technique for consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, generating strong-perturbed samples for strong-weak pseudo-supervision.Existing mix-up operations are performed either randomly or with predefined rules, such as replacing low-confidence patches with high-confidence ones.The former lacks control over the perturbation degree, leading to overfitting on randomly perturbed samples, while the latter tends to generate images with trivial perturbations, both of which limit the effectiveness of consistency learning.This paper aims to answer the following question: How can image mix-up perturbation be adaptively performed during training?To this end, we propose an Adaptive Mix algorithm (AdaMix) for image mix-up in a self-paced learning manner.Given that, in general, a model's performance gradually improves during training, AdaMix is equipped with a self-paced curriculum that, in the initial training stage, provides relatively simple perturbed samples and then gradually increases the difficulty of perturbed images by adaptively controlling the perturbation degree based on the model's learning state estimated by a self-paced regularize.We develop three frameworks with our AdaMix, i.e., AdaMix-ST, AdaMix-MT, and AdaMix-CT, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets, including both 2D and 3D modalities, show that the proposed frameworks are capable of achieving superior performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, compared with the state-of-the-art, AdaMix-CT achieves relative improvements of 2.62% in Dice and 48.25% in average surface distance on the ACDC dataset with 10% labeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>The results demonstrate that mix-up operations with dynamically adjusted perturbation strength based on the segmentation model's state can significantly enhance the effectiveness of consistency regularization.</p>

                  <p>Fredman proposed in 1976 the following algorithmic problem: Given are a ground set $X$, some partial order $P$ over $X$, and some comparison oracle $O_L$ that specifies a linear order $L$ over $X$ that extends $P$. A query to $O_L$ has as input distinct $x, x' \in X$ and outputs whether $x <_L x'$ or vice versa.If we denote by $e(P)$ the number of linear extensions of $P$, then $\log e(P)$ is a worst-case lower bound on the number of queries needed to output the sorted order of $X$.   Fredman did not specify in what form the partial order is given.Haeupler, Hlad\'ik, Iacono, Rozhon, Tarjan, and T\v{e}tek ('24) propose to assume as input a directed acyclic graph, $G$, with $m$ edges and $n=|X|$ vertices.Denote by $P_G$ the partial order induced by $G$. Algorithmic performance is measured in running time and the number of queries used, where they use $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries to output $X$ in its sorted order.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Their algorithm is worst-case optimal in terms of running time and queries, both. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Their algorithm combines topological sorting with heapsort, and uses sophisticated data structures (including a recent type of heap with a working-set bound).Their analysis relies upon sophisticated counting arguments using entropy, recursively defined sets defined over the run of their algorithm, and vertices in the graph that they identify as bottlenecks for sorting.   In this paper, we do away with sophistication.We show that when the input is a directed acyclic graph then the problem admits a simple solution using $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries.Especially our proofs are much simpler as we avoid the usage of advanced charging arguments and data structures, and instead rely upon two brief observations.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table.Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization.However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs.In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification.Our method adaptively locates \textit{surprising tokens} of the input.A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is "certain but wrong", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time.By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data.The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>We also introduce a new benchmark Dolma-Book developed upon a novel framework, which employs book data collected both before and after model training to provide further evaluation.</p>

                  <p>The Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) is one of the most fundamental tools in differential privacy (DP).It works as a backbone for adaptive data analysis by answering a sequence of queries on a given dataset, and gleaning useful information in a privacy-preserving manner.Unlike the typical private query releases that directly publicize the noisy query results, SVT is less informative -- it keeps the noisy query results to itself and only reveals a binary bit for each query, indicating whether the query result surpasses a predefined threshold.To provide a rigorous DP guarantee for SVT, prior works in the literature adopt a conservative privacy analysis by assuming the direct disclosure of noisy query results as in typical private query releases.This approach, however, hinders SVT from achieving higher query accuracy due to an overestimation of the privacy risks, which further leads to an excessive noise injection using the Laplacian or Gaussian noise for perturbation.Motivated by this, we provide a new privacy analysis for SVT by considering its less informative nature.Our analysis results not only broaden the range of applicable noise types for perturbation in SVT, but also identify the exponential noise as optimal among all evaluated noises (which, however, is usually deemed non-applicable in prior works).The main challenge in applying exponential noise to SVT is mitigating the sub-optimal performance due to the bias introduced by noise distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we develop a utility-oriented optimal threshold correction method and an appending strategy, which enhances the performance of SVT by increasing the precision and recall, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our proposed methods is substantiated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating significant improvements up to $50\%$ across evaluated metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this thesis, we propose an approach to identity resolution across social media platforms using the topics, sentiments, and timings of the posts on the platforms.After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from Disqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the two platforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal approach generally performs better.We found that the temporal window size influences results more than the shifting amount.On the other hand, our sentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little difference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods.We also experimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model, which achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of 2525 in our collected corpus.Future work includes refining sentiment analysis by evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional phases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified rewards.</p>

                  <p>Several scenario-based frameworks exist to aid in vehicle system development and safety assurance.However, there is a need for approaches that combine different types of datasets that offer varying levels of case severity, data richness, and representativeness.This study presents an integrated scenario-based analysis approach that encompasses scenario definition, fusion, parametrization, and test case generation.For this process, ten years of fatal and non-fatal national crash data from the United States are combined with over 34 million miles of naturalistic driving data.An illustrative example scenario, "turns at intersection", is chosen to demonstrate this approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, scenario definitions are established from both record-based and continuous time series data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Second, a frequency analysis is performed to understand how often events from the same scenario occur at different severities across datasets.Third, an analysis is performed to show the key factors relevant to the scenario and the distribution of various parameters.Finally, a method to combine both types of data into representative test case scenarios is presented.These techniques improve scenario representativeness in two major ways: first, they populate an entire spectrum of cases ranging from routine events to fatal crashes; and second, they provide context-rich, multi-year data by combining large-scale national and naturalistic datasets.</p>

                  <p>In the field of deep learning-driven Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to be trained using only slide-level diagnostic labels.Previous MIL researches have primarily focused on enhancing feature aggregators for globally analyzing WSIs, but overlook a causal relationship in diagnosis: model's prediction should ideally stem solely from regions of the image that contain diagnostic evidence (such as tumor cells), which usually occupy relatively small areas.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation and establish the truly causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostic evidence regions, we propose Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>CI-MIL integrates feature distillation with a novel patch decorrelation mechanism, employing a two-stage causal inference approach to distill and process patches with high diagnostic value.Initially, CI-MIL leverages feature distillation to identify patches likely containing tumor cells and extracts their corresponding feature representations.These features are then mapped to random Fourier feature space, where a learnable weighting scheme is employed to minimize inter-feature correlations, effectively reducing redundancy from homogenous patches and mitigating data bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These processes strengthen the causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostically relevant regions, making the prediction more direct and reliable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p>

                  <p>Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities.When domain distribution changes, the fragility of subtle features leads to a pronounced deterioration in model performance.Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning both the commonality and specificity within categories.Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG.Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is achieved through a decorrelation function on disentangled segments, constraints on common feature consistency, specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration operation across granularities.By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories.Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.1% in terms of FGDG performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond that, the explainability analysis and experiments on various mainstream model architectures confirm the validity of FS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models (DM) represent one of the most advanced generative models today, yet recent studies suggest that DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.Backdoor attacks establish hidden associations between particular input patterns and model behaviors, compromising model integrity by triggering undesirable actions with manipulated input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This vulnerability poses substantial risks, including reputational damage to model owners and the dissemination of harmful content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>To mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks, there have been some investigations on backdoor detection and model repair.However, previous work fails to purify the backdoored DMs created by state-of-the-art attacks, rendering the field much underexplored.To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Diff-Cleanse}, a novel two-stage backdoor defense framework specifically designed for DMs.The first stage employs a innovative trigger inversion technique to detect the backdoor and reconstruct the trigger, and the second stage utilizes a structural pruning method to eliminate the backdoor.We evaluate our framework on hundreds of DMs attacked by 3 existing backdoor attack methods.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-Cleanse achieves nearly 100\% detection accuracy and effectively mitigates backdoor impacts, preserving the model's benign performance with minimal compromise.Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/shymuel/diff-cleanse.</p>

                  <p>Alongside the continuous process of improving AI performance through the development of more sophisticated models, researchers have also focused their attention to the emerging concept of data-centric AI, which emphasizes the important role of data in a systematic machine learning training process.Nonetheless, the development of models has also continued apace.One result of this progress is the development of the Transformer Architecture, which possesses a high level of capability in multiple domains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV) and Time Series Forecasting (TSF).Its performance is, however, heavily dependent on input data preprocessing and output data evaluation, justifying a data-centric approach to future research.We argue that data-centric AI is essential for training AI models, particularly for transformer-based TSF models efficiently.However, there is a gap regarding the integration of transformer-based TSF and data-centric AI.This survey aims to pin down this gap via the extensive literature review based on the proposed taxonomy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We review the previous research works from a data-centric AI perspective and we intend to lay the foundation work for the future development of transformer-based architecture and data-centric AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span></p>
