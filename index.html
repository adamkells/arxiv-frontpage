                  <p>To address the global issue of hateful content proliferating in online platforms, hate speech detection (HSD) models are typically developed on datasets collected in the United States, thereby failing to generalize to English dialects from the Majority World.Furthermore, HSD models are often evaluated on curated samples, raising concerns about overestimating model performance in real-world settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce NaijaHate, the first dataset annotated for HSD which contains a representative sample of Nigerian tweets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>We demonstrate that HSD evaluated on biased datasets traditionally used in the literature largely overestimates real-world performance on representative data.We also propose NaijaXLM-T, a pretrained model tailored to the Nigerian Twitter context, and establish the key role played by domain-adaptive pretraining and finetuning in maximizing HSD performance.Finally, we show that in this context, a human-in-the-loop approach to content moderation where humans review 1% of Nigerian tweets flagged as hateful would enable to moderate 60% of all hateful content.Taken together, these results pave the way towards robust HSD systems and a better protection of social media users from hateful content in low-resource settings.</p>

                  <p>Action recognition from video data forms a cornerstone with wide-ranging applications.Single-view action recognition faces limitations due to its reliance on a single viewpoint.In contrast, multi-view approaches capture complementary information from various viewpoints for improved accuracy.Recently, event cameras have emerged as innovative bio-inspired sensors, leading to advancements in event-based action recognition.However, existing works predominantly focus on single-view scenarios, leaving a gap in multi-view event data exploitation, particularly in challenges like information deficit and semantic misalignment.To bridge this gap, we introduce HyperMV, a multi-view event-based action recognition framework.HyperMV converts discrete event data into frame-like representations and extracts view-related features using a shared convolutional network.By treating segments as vertices and constructing hyperedges using rule-based and KNN-based strategies, a multi-view hypergraph neural network that captures relationships across viewpoint and temporal features is established.The vertex attention hypergraph propagation is also introduced for enhanced feature fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To prompt research in this area, we present the largest multi-view event-based action dataset $\text{THU}^{\text{MV-EACT}}\text{-50}$, comprising 50 actions from 6 viewpoints, which surpasses existing datasets by over tenfold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span>Experimental results show that HyperMV significantly outperforms baselines in both cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, and also exceeds the state-of-the-arts in frame-based multi-view action recognition.</p>

                  <p>3D dense captioning stands as a cornerstone in achieving a comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes through natural language.It has recently witnessed remarkable achievements, particularly in indoor settings.However, the exploration of 3D dense captioning in outdoor scenes is hindered by two major challenges: 1) the \textbf{domain gap} between indoor and outdoor scenes, such as dynamics and sparse visual inputs, makes it difficult to directly adapt existing indoor methods; 2) the \textbf{lack of data} with comprehensive box-caption pair annotations specifically tailored for outdoor scenes.To this end, we introduce the new task of outdoor 3D dense captioning.As input, we assume a LiDAR point cloud and a set of RGB images captured by the panoramic camera rig.The expected output is a set of object boxes with captions.To tackle this task, we propose the TOD3Cap network, which leverages the BEV representation to generate object box proposals and integrates Relation Q-Former with LLaMA-Adapter to generate rich captions for these objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce the TOD3Cap dataset, the largest one to our knowledge for 3D dense captioning in outdoor scenes, which contains 2.3M descriptions of 64.3K outdoor objects from 850 scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.931</span></span>Notably, our TOD3Cap network can effectively localize and caption 3D objects in outdoor scenes, which outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin (+9.6 CiDEr@0.5IoU).Code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/jxbbb/TOD3Cap.</p>

                  <p>Many real-world data sets contain a temporal component or involve transitions from state to state.For exploratory data analysis, we can represent these high-dimensional data sets in two-dimensional maps, using embeddings of the data objects under exploration and representing their temporal relationships with directed edges.Most existing dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE and UMAP, do not take into account the temporal or relational nature of the data when constructing the embeddings, resulting in temporally cluttered visualizations that obscure potentially interesting patterns.To address this problem, we propose two complementary, direction-aware loss terms in the optimization function of t-SNE that emphasize the temporal aspects of the data, guiding the optimization and the resulting embedding to reveal temporal patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.The Directional Coherence Loss (DCL) encourages nearby arrows connecting two adjacent time series points to point in the same direction, while the Edge Length Loss (ELL) penalizes arrows - which effectively represent time gaps in the visualized embedding - based on their length.Both loss terms are differentiable and can be easily incorporated into existing dimensionality reduction techniques.By promoting local directionality of the directed edges, our procedure produces more temporally meaningful and less cluttered visualizations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a toy dataset and two real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span></p>

                  <p>Utility and privacy are two crucial measurements of the quality of synthetic tabular data.While significant advancements have been made in privacy measures, generating synthetic samples with high utility remains challenging.To enhance the utility of synthetic samples, we propose a novel architecture called the DownStream Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (DSF-GAN).This approach incorporates feedback from a downstream prediction model during training to augment the generator's loss function with valuable information.Thus, DSF-GAN utilizes a downstream prediction task to enhance the utility of synthetic samples.To evaluate our method, we tested it using two popular datasets.Our experiments demonstrate improved model performance when training on synthetic samples generated by DSF-GAN, compared to those generated by the same GAN architecture without feedback.The evaluation was conducted on the same validation set comprising real samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and datasets used in this research will be made openly available for ease of reproduction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system.This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR).When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively.However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data.Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs.Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span>The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed.The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.</p>

Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models, from the standard ResNet visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4, significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60\%.Our work suggests that diffusion models can be an effective source to test vision models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenshuang-zhang/imagenet_d. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span></p>

                  <p>Digital news platforms use news recommenders as the main instrument to cater to the individual information needs of readers.Despite an increasingly language-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news in multiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major, resource-rich languages, and English in particular.Moreover, nearly all news recommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more and more users tend to consume information in at least two languages.Accordingly, the existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of publicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of news recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual news recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine translation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse languages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>Using xMIND, we systematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural news recommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT) cross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual news consumption patterns.Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even when based on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performance losses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLT training has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual news consumption.Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort in multilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The xMIND dataset is available at https://github.com/andreeaiana/xMIND. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gestures play a key role in human communication.Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation, while managing to generate beat-aligned motions, struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance.Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal, semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion, and can be controlled by focusing on certain words.Therefore, we present ConvoFusion, a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis, which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs, but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis.Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing.Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures, the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released, which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.961</span></span>We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks.We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video at our website.</p>

                  <p>Predictions of opaque black-box systems are frequently deployed in high-stakes applications such as healthcare.For such applications, it is crucial to assess how models handle samples beyond the domain of training data.While several metrics and tests exist to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) data from in-distribution (InD) data to a deep neural network (DNN), their performance varies significantly across datasets, models, and tasks, which limits their practical use.In this paper, we propose a hypothesis-driven approach to quantify whether a new sample is InD or OoD.Given a trained DNN and some input, we first feed the input through the DNN and compute an ensemble of OoD metrics, which we term latent responses.We then formulate the OoD detection problem as a hypothesis test between latent responses of different groups, and use permutation-based resampling to infer the significance of the observed latent responses under a null hypothesis.We adapt our method to detect an unseen sample of bacteria to a trained deep learning model, and show that it reveals interpretable differences between InD and OoD latent responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work has implications for systematic novelty detection and informed decision-making from classifiers trained on a subset of labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in learning semantic category discrimination.Despite the remarkable performance of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to the well-annotated data.However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the multimodal scenario.In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges -- enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and \emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval.First, we propose a semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend different modalities and provide precise transport cost.Second, to narrow the discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching.Both of these two components leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate effective cost function.The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.</p>

                  <p>Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data.Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data.To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment.However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications.Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts.To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model.Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively.Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>For severely affected COVID-19 patients, it is crucial to identify high-risk patients and predict survival and need for intensive care (ICU).Most of the proposed models are not well reported making them less reproducible and prone to high risk of bias particularly in presence of imbalance data/class.In this study, the performances of nine machine and deep learning algorithms in combination with two widely used feature selection methods were investigated to predict last status representing mortality, ICU requirement, and ventilation days.Fivefold cross-validation was used for training and validation purposes.To minimize bias, the training and testing sets were split maintaining similar distributions.Only 10 out of 122 features were found to be useful in prediction modelling with Acute kidney injury during hospitalization feature being the most important one.The algorithms performances depend on feature numbers and data pre-processing techniques.LSTM performs the best in predicting last status and ICU requirement with 90%, 92%, 86% and 95% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DNN performs the best in predicting Ventilation days with 88% accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Considering all the factors and limitations including absence of exact time point of clinical onset, LSTM with carefully selected features can accurately predict last status and ICU requirement.DNN performs the best in predicting Ventilation days.Appropriate machine learning algorithm with carefully selected features and balance data can accurately predict mortality, ICU requirement and ventilation support.Such model can be very useful in emergency and pandemic where prompt and precise</p>

                  <p>In the evolving field of psychopathology, the accurate assessment and forecasting of data derived from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is crucial.EMA offers contextually-rich psychopathological measurements over time, that practically lead to Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data.Thus, many challenges arise in analysis from the temporal complexities inherent in emotional, behavioral, and contextual EMA data as well as their inter-dependencies.To address both of these aspects, this research investigates the performance of Recurrent and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).Overall, GNNs, by incorporating additional information from graphs reflecting the inner relationships between the variables, notably enhance the results by decreasing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 0.84 compared to the baseline LSTM model at 1.02.Therefore, the effect of constructing graphs with different characteristics on GNN performance is also explored.Additionally, GNN-learned graphs, which are dynamically refined during the training process, were evaluated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using such graphs showed a similarly good performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Thus, graph learning proved also promising for other GNN methods, potentially refining the pre-defined graphs.</p>

                  <p>Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational approach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within artificial intelligence.This method extends to the training of DNNs, an approach known as neuroevolution.However, neuroevolution is an inherently resource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of thousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network.To address the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still attaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution.Despite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into neuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the effective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in neuroevolution.In this context, we address these challenges by employing a suitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as NeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares.The amalgamation of these two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the NeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM).For comparison purposes, we also code and use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice in neuroevolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16 model in accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN operations, a singular run is typically the norm.To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Significantly, our methodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model demonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Noteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25% reduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for neuroevolution.</p>

                  <p>Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a promising task to train high-performance small models to enhance actual deployment without relying on the original training data.Existing methods commonly avoid relying on private data by utilizing synthetic or sampled data.However, a long-overlooked issue is that the severe distribution shifts between their substitution and original data, which manifests as huge differences in the quality of images and class proportions.The harmful shifts are essentially the confounder that significantly causes performance bottlenecks.To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a novel perspective with causal inference to disentangle the student models from the impact of such shifts.By designing a customized causal graph, we first reveal the causalities among the variables in the DFKD task.Subsequently, we propose a Knowledge Distillation Causal Intervention (KDCI) framework based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder.KDCI can be flexibly combined with most existing state-of-the-art baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments in combination with six representative DFKD methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDCI, which can obviously help existing methods under almost all settings, \textit{e.g.}, improving the baseline by up to 15.54\% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>RGB-T tracking, a vital downstream task of object tracking, has made remarkable progress in recent years.Yet, it remains hindered by two major challenges: 1) the trade-off between performance and efficiency; 2) the scarcity of training data.To address the latter challenge, some recent methods employ prompts to fine-tune pre-trained RGB tracking models and leverage upstream knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner.However, these methods inadequately explore modality-independent patterns and disregard the dynamic reliability of different modalities in open scenarios.We propose M3PT, a novel RGB-T prompt tracking method that leverages middle fusion and multi-modal and multi-stage visual prompts to overcome these challenges.We pioneer the use of the middle fusion framework for RGB-T tracking, which achieves a balance between performance and efficiency.Furthermore, we incorporate the pre-trained RGB tracking model into the framework and utilize multiple flexible prompt strategies to adapt the pre-trained model to the comprehensive exploration of uni-modal patterns and the improved modeling of fusion-modal features, harnessing the potential of prompt learning in RGB-T tracking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four challenging benchmarks, while attaining 46.1 fps inference speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Analyzing the behavior of cryptographic functions in stripped binaries is a challenging but essential task.Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection.Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work.In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries.In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoCBinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language.The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches.To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database.In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain.And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions.Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aimed at augmenting recommender systems with recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence.This task has been formulated as a sequence-to-sequence generation process, wherein the input sequence encompasses data pertaining to the user's previously interacted items, and the output sequence denotes the generative identifier for the suggested item.However, existing generative recommendation approaches still encounter challenges in (i) effectively integrating user-item collaborative signals and item content information within a unified generative framework, and (ii) executing an efficient alignment between content information and collaborative signals.   In this paper, we introduce content-based collaborative generation for recommender systems, denoted as ColaRec.To capture collaborative signals, the generative item identifiers are derived from a pretrained collaborative filtering model, while the user is represented through the aggregation of interacted items' content.Subsequently, the aggregated textual description of items is fed into a language model to encapsulate content information.This integration enables ColaRec to amalgamate collaborative signals and content information within an end-to-end framework.Regarding the alignment, we propose an item indexing task to facilitate the mapping between the content-based semantic space and the interaction-based collaborative space.Additionally, a contrastive loss is introduced to ensure that items with similar collaborative GIDs possess comparable content representations, thereby enhancing alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate the efficacy of ColaRec, we conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Empirical results substantiate the superior performance of ColaRec.</p>

                  <p>Gestures play a key role in human communication.Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation, while managing to generate beat-aligned motions, struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance.Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal, semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion, and can be controlled by focusing on certain words.Therefore, we present ConvoFusion, a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis, which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs, but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis.Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing.Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures.To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures, the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released, which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video at our website.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation.Yet, incorporating LLM-based code generation into real-life software projects poses challenges, as the generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information.As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper puts forward a novel approach, termed ProCoder, which iteratively refines the project-level code context for precise code generation, guided by the compiler feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>In particular, ProCoder first leverages compiler techniques to identify a mismatch between the generated code and the project's context.It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository.We integrate ProCoder with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation.Experimental results show that ProCoder significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on project context, and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines.</p>

                  <p>Remote sensing image classification forms the foundation of various understanding tasks, serving a crucial function in remote sensing image interpretation.The recent advancements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have markedly enhanced classification accuracy.Nonetheless, remote sensing scene classification remains a significant challenge, especially given the complexity and diversity of remote sensing scenarios and the variability of spatiotemporal resolutions.The capacity for whole-image understanding can provide more precise semantic cues for scene discrimination.In this paper, we introduce RSMamba, a novel architecture for remote sensing image classification.RSMamba is based on the State Space Model (SSM) and incorporates an efficient, hardware-aware design known as the Mamba.It integrates the advantages of both a global receptive field and linear modeling complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome the limitation of the vanilla Mamba, which can only model causal sequences and is not adaptable to two-dimensional image data, we propose a dynamic multi-path activation mechanism to augment Mamba's capacity to model non-causal data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.586</span></span>Notably, RSMamba maintains the inherent modeling mechanism of the vanilla Mamba, yet exhibits superior performance across multiple remote sensing image classification datasets.This indicates that RSMamba holds significant potential to function as the backbone of future visual foundation models.The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/KyanChen/RSMamba}.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural network models have demonstrated their effectiveness in classifying multi-label data from various domains.Typically, they employ a training mode that combines mini-batches with optimizers, where each sample is randomly selected with equal probability when constructing mini-batches.However, the intrinsic class imbalance in multi-label data may bias the model towards majority labels, since samples relevant to minority labels may be underrepresented in each mini-batch.Meanwhile, during the training process, we observe that instances associated with minority labels tend to induce greater losses.Existing heuristic batch selection methods, such as priority selection of samples with high contribution to the objective function, i.e., samples with high loss, have been proven to accelerate convergence while reducing the loss and test error in single-label data.However, batch selection methods have not yet been applied and validated in multi-label data.In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective adaptive batch selection algorithm tailored to multi-label deep learning models.It adaptively selects each batch by prioritizing hard samples related to minority labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A variant of our method also takes informative label correlations into consideration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Comprehensive experiments combining five multi-label deep learning models on thirteen benchmark datasets show that our method converges faster and performs better than random batch selection.</p>

                  <p>Investigating child-computer interactions within their contexts is vital for designing technology that caters to children's needs.However, determining what aspects of context are relevant for designing child-centric technology remains a challenge.We introduce EXPLORA, a multimodal, multistage online methodology comprising three pivotal stages: (1) building a teacher-apprentice relationship,(2) learning from child-teachers, and (3) assessing and reinforcing researcher-apprentice learning.Central to EXPLORA is the collection of attitudinal data through pre-observation interviews, offering researchers a deeper understanding of children's characteristics and contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This informs subsequent online observations, allowing researchers to focus on frequent interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Furthermore, researchers can validate preliminary assumptions with children.A means-ends analysis framework aids in the systematic analysis of data, shedding light on context, agency and homework-information searching processes children employ in their activities.To illustrate EXPLORA's capabilities, we present nine single case studies investigating Brazilian child-caregiver dyads' (children ages 9-11) use of technology in homework information-searching.</p>

                  <p>Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing.Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data.With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities.However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset.Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation.In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space.Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency.Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns.Our implementation is available at https://github.com/WAL-l/SeisFusion.</p>

                  <p>Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image processing.These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry.However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many challenges have emerged.This thesis presents various approaches that address robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.   Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before certification and deployment in practice.Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the adversarial attack literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, building trust in AI-based models requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that are more explainable and interpretable a priori.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and explainability.Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in the related research.Besides methodological developments for robust and explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and improving their design and robustness.In addition to the theoretical developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.</p>

                Not All Similarities Are Created Equal: Leveraging Data-Driven Biases to Inform GenAI Copyright Disputes

                  <p>The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, including GitHub Copilot, OpenAI GPT, and Stable Diffusion, has revolutionized content creation, enabling non-professionals to produce high-quality content across various domains.This transformative technology has led to a surge of synthetic content and sparked legal disputes over copyright infringement.To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the learning capacity of GenAI models for copyright legal analysis, demonstrated with GPT2 and Stable Diffusion models.Copyright law distinguishes between original expressions and generic ones (Sc\`enes \`a faire), protecting the former and permitting reproduction of the latter.However, this distinction has historically been challenging to make consistently, leading to over-protection of copyrighted works.GenAI offers an unprecedented opportunity to enhance this legal analysis by revealing shared patterns in preexisting works.We propose a data-driven approach to identify the genericity of works created by GenAI, employing "data-driven bias" to assess the genericity of expressive compositions.This approach aids in copyright scope determination by utilizing the capabilities of GenAI to identify and prioritize expressive elements and rank them according to their frequency in the model's dataset.The potential implications of measuring expressive genericity for copyright law are profound.Such scoring could assist courts in determining copyright scope during litigation, inform the registration practices of Copyright Offices, allowing registration of only highly original synthetic works, and help copyright owners signal the value of their works and facilitate fairer licensing deals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More generally, this approach offers valuable insights to policymakers grappling with adapting copyright law to the challenges posed by the era of GenAI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>
