                  <p>In this paper, we propose a learning-based image fragment pair-searching and -matching approach to solve the challenging restoration problem.Existing works use rule-based methods to match similar contour shapes or textures, which are always difficult to tune hyperparameters for extensive data and computationally time-consuming.Therefore, we propose a neural network that can effectively utilize neighbor textures with contour shape information to fundamentally improve performance.First, we employ a graph-based network to extract the local contour and texture features of fragments.Then, for the pair-searching task, we adopt a linear transformer-based module to integrate these local features and use contrastive loss to encode the global features of each fragment.For the pair-matching task, we design a weighted fusion module to dynamically fuse extracted local contour and texture features, and formulate a similarity matrix for each pair of fragments to calculate the matching score and infer the adjacent segment of contours.To faithfully evaluate our proposed network, we created a new image fragment dataset through an algorithm we designed that tears complete images into irregular fragments.The experimental results show that our proposed network achieves excellent pair-searching accuracy, reduces matching errors, and significantly reduces computational time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Details, sourcecode, and data are available in our supplementary material. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cross-lingual cross-modal retrieval has garnered increasing attention recently, which aims to achieve the alignment between vision and target language (V-T) without using any annotated V-T data pairs.Current methods employ machine translation (MT) to construct pseudo-parallel data pairs, which are then used to learn a multi-lingual and multi-modal embedding space that aligns visual and target-language representations.However, the large heterogeneous gap between vision and text, along with the noise present in target language translations, poses significant challenges in effectively aligning their representations.To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, Cross-Lingual to Cross-Modal (CL2CM), which improves the alignment between vision and target language using cross-lingual transfer.This approach allows us to fully leverage the merits of multi-lingual pre-trained models (e.g., mBERT) and the benefits of the same modality structure, i.e., smaller gap, to provide reliable and comprehensive semantic correspondence (knowledge) for the cross-modal network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our proposed approach on two multilingual image-text datasets, Multi30K and MSCOCO, and one video-text dataset, VATEX. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and its high potential for large-scale retrieval.</p>

                  <p>Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a very important task in healthcare industry, which answers a natural language question with a medical image.Existing VQA techniques in information systems can be directly applied to solving the task.However, they often suffer from (i) the data insufficient problem, which makes it difficult to train the state of the arts (SOTAs) for the domain-specific task, and (ii) the reproducibility problem, that many existing models have not been thoroughly evaluated in a unified experimental setup.To address these issues, this paper develops a Benchmark Evaluation SysTem for Medical Visual Question Answering, denoted by BESTMVQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given self-collected clinical data, our system provides a useful tool for users to automatically build Med-VQA datasets, which helps overcoming the data <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>insufficient problem.Users also can conveniently select a wide spectrum of SOTA models from our model library to perform a comprehensive empirical study.With simple configurations, our system automatically trains and evaluates the selected models over a benchmark dataset, and reports the comprehensive results for users to develop new techniques or perform medical practice.Limitations of existing work are overcome (i) by the data generation tool, which automatically constructs new datasets from unstructured clinical data, and (ii) by evaluating SOTAs on benchmark datasets in a unified experimental setup.The demonstration video of our system can be found at https://youtu.be/QkEeFlu1x4A.

                  <p>The open streets initiative "opens" streets to pedestrians and bicyclists by closing them to cars and trucks.The initiative, adopted by many cities across North America, increases community space in urban environments.But could open streets also make cities safer and less congested?We study this question by framing the choice of which streets to open as a reinforcement learning problem.In order to simulate the impact of opening streets, we first compare models for predicting vehicle collisions given network and temporal data.We find that a recurrent graph neural network, leveraging the graph structure and the short-term temporal dependence of the data, gives the best predictive performance.Then, with the ability to simulate collisions and traffic, we frame a reinforcement learning problem to find which streets to open.We compare the streets in the NYC Open Streets program to those proposed by a Q-learning algorithm.We find that the streets proposed by the Q-learning algorithm have reliably better outcomes, while streets in the program have similar outcomes to randomly selected streets.We present our work as a step toward principally choosing which streets to open for safer and less congested cities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All our code and data are available on Github. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>To synthesize high-fidelity samples, diffusion models typically require auxiliary data to guide the generation process.However, it is impractical to procure the painstaking patch-level annotation effort required in specialized domains like histopathology and satellite imagery; it is often performed by domain experts and involves hundreds of millions of patches.Modern-day self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode rich semantic and visual information.In this paper, we posit that such representations are expressive enough to act as proxies to fine-grained human labels.We introduce a novel approach that trains diffusion models conditioned on embeddings from SSL.Our diffusion models successfully project these features back to high-quality histopathology and remote sensing images.In addition, we construct larger images by assembling spatially consistent patches inferred from SSL embeddings, preserving long-range dependencies.Augmenting real data by generating variations of real images improves downstream classifier accuracy for patch-level and larger, image-scale classification tasks.Our models are effective even on datasets not encountered during training, demonstrating their robustness and generalizability.Generating images from learned embeddings is agnostic to the source of the embeddings.The SSL embeddings used to generate a large image can either be extracted from a reference image, or sampled from an auxiliary model conditioned on any related modality (e.g. class labels, text, genomic data).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As proof of concept, we introduce the text-to-large image synthesis paradigm where we successfully synthesize large pathology and satellite images out of text descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image restoration has always been a cutting-edge topic in the academic and industrial fields of computer vision.Since degradation signals are often random and diverse, "all-in-one" models that can do blind image restoration have been concerned in recent years.Early works require training specialized headers and tails to handle each degradation of concern, which are manually cumbersome.Recent works focus on learning visual prompts from data distribution to identify degradation type.However, the prompts employed in most of models are non-text, lacking sufficient emphasis on the importance of human-in-the-loop.In this paper, an effective textual prompt guided image restoration model has been proposed.In this model, task-specific BERT is fine-tuned to accurately understand user's instructions and generating textual prompt guidance.Depth-wise multi-head transposed attentions and gated convolution modules are designed to bridge the gap between textual prompts and visual features.The proposed model has innovatively introduced semantic prompts into low-level visual domain.It highlights the potential to provide a natural, precise, and controllable way to perform image restoration tasks.Extensive experiments have been done on public denoising, dehazing and deraining datasets.The experiment results demonstrate that, compared with popular state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model can obtain much more superior performance, achieving accurate recognition and removal of degradation without increasing model's complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Related source codes and data will be publicly available on github site https://github.com/MoTong-AI-studio/TextPromptIR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the size of the datasets getting larger, accurately annotating such datasets is becoming more impractical due to the expensiveness on both time and economy.Therefore, crowd-sourcing has been widely adopted to alleviate the cost of collecting labels, which also inevitably introduces label noise and eventually degrades the performance of the model.To learn from crowd-sourcing annotations, modeling the expertise of each annotator is a common but challenging paradigm, because the annotations collected by crowd-sourcing are usually highly-sparse.To alleviate this problem, we propose Coupled Confusion Correction (CCC), where two models are simultaneously trained to correct the confusion matrices learned by each other.Via bi-level optimization, the confusion matrices learned by one model can be corrected by the distilled data from the other.Moreover, we cluster the ``annotator groups'' who share similar expertise so that their confusion matrices could be corrected together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this way, the expertise of the annotators, especially of those who provide seldom labels, could be better captured. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, we point out that the annotation sparsity not only means the average number of labels is low, but also there are always some annotators who provide very few labels, which is neglected by previous works when constructing synthetic crowd-sourcing annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Based on that, we propose to use Beta distribution to control the generation of the crowd-sourcing labels so that the synthetic annotations could be more consistent with the real-world ones.Extensive experiments are conducted on two types of synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets, the results of which demonstrate that CCC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>With the proliferation of social media, there has been a sharp increase in offensive content, particularly targeting vulnerable groups, exacerbating social problems such as hatred, racism, and sexism.Detecting offensive language use is crucial to prevent offensive language from being widely shared on social media.However, the accurate detection of irony, implication, and various forms of hate speech on social media remains a challenge.Natural language-based deep learning models require extensive training with large, comprehensive, and labeled datasets.Unfortunately, manually creating such datasets is both costly and error-prone.Additionally, the presence of human-bias in offensive language datasets is a major concern for deep learning models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a linguistic data augmentation approach to reduce bias in labeling processes, which aims to mitigate the influence of human bias by leveraging the power of machines to improve the accuracy and fairness of labeling processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>This approach has the potential to improve offensive language classification tasks across multiple languages and reduce the prevalence of offensive content on social media.</p>

                  <p>Optical fiber sensing is a technology wherein audio, vibrations, and temperature are detected using an optical fiber; especially the audio/vibrations-aware sensing is called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS).In DAS, observed data, which is comprised of multichannel data, has suffered from severe noise levels because of the optical noise or the installation methods.In conventional methods for denoising DAS data, signal-processing- or deep-neural-network (DNN)-based models have been studied.The signal-processing-based methods have the interpretability, i.e., non-black box.The DNN-based methods are good at flexibility designing network architectures and objective functions, that is, priors.However, there is no balance between the interpretability and the flexibility of priors in the DAS studies.The DNN-based methods also require a large amount of training data in general.To address the problems, we propose a DNN-structure signal-processing-based denoising method in this paper.As the priors of DAS, we employ spatial knowledge; low rank and channel-dependent sensitivity using the DNN-based structure.The result of fiber-acoustic sensing shows that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods and the robustness to the number of the spatial ranks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the optimized parameters of the proposed method indicate the relationship with the channel sensitivity; the interpretability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Incomplete multi-view clustering becomes an important research problem, since multi-view data with missing values are ubiquitous in real-world applications.Although great efforts have been made for incomplete multi-view clustering, there are still some challenges: 1) most existing methods didn't make full use of multi-view information to deal with missing values; 2) most methods just employ the consistent information within multi-view data but ignore the complementary information; 3) For the existing incomplete multi-view clustering methods, incomplete multi-view representation learning and clustering are treated as independent processes, which leads to performance gap.In this work, we proposed a novel Incomplete Contrastive Multi-View Clustering method with high-confidence guiding (ICMVC).Firstly, we proposed a multi-view consistency relation transfer plus graph convolutional network to tackle missing values problem.Secondly, instance-level attention fusion and high-confidence guiding are proposed to exploit the complementary information while instance-level contrastive learning for latent representation is designed to employ the consistent information.Thirdly, an end-to-end framework is proposed to integrate multi-view missing values handling, multi-view representation learning and clustering assignment for joint optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments compared with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/liunian-Jay/ICMVC.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, such as the Stanford Natural Language Inference and the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference, coupled with the advent of pre-trained language models, has significantly contributed to the development of the natural language inference domain.However, these crowdsourced annotated datasets often contain biases or dataset artifacts, leading to overestimated model performance and poor generalization.In this work, we focus on investigating dataset artifacts and developing strategies to address these issues.Through the utilization of a novel statistical testing procedure, we discover a significant association between vocabulary distribution and text entailment classes, emphasizing vocabulary as a notable source of biases.To mitigate these issues, we propose several automatic data augmentation strategies spanning character to word levels.By fine-tuning the ELECTRA pre-trained language model, we compare the performance of boosted models with augmented data against their baseline counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively enhance model accuracy and reduce biases by up to 0.66% and 1.14%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we study the problem of continual learning (CL) where the goal is to learn a model on a sequence of tasks, such that the data from the previous tasks becomes unavailable while learning on the current task data.CL is essentially a balancing act between being able to learn on the new task (i.e., plasticity) and maintaining the performance on the previously learned concepts (i.e., stability).With an aim to address the stability-plasticity trade-off, we propose to perform weight-ensembling of the model parameters of the previous and current task.This weight-ensembled model, which we call Continual Model Averaging (or CoMA), attains high accuracy on the current task by leveraging plasticity, while not deviating too far from the previous weight configuration, ensuring stability.We also propose an improved variant of CoMA, named Continual Fisher-weighted Model Averaging (or CoFiMA), that selectively weighs each parameter in the weight ensemble by leveraging the Fisher information of the weights of the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the variants are conceptually simple, easy to implement, and effective in attaining state-of-the-art performance on several standard CL benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep graph convolution networks (GCNs) have recently shown excellent performance in traffic prediction tasks.However, they face some challenges.First, few existing models consider the influence of auxiliary information, i.e., weather and holidays, which may result in a poor grasp of spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data.Second, both the construction of a dynamic adjacent matrix and regular graph convolution operations have quadratic computation complexity, which restricts the scalability of GCN-based models.To address such challenges, this work proposes a deep encoder-decoder model entitled AIMSAN.It contains an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and sparse cross attention-based graph convolution network (SAN).The former learns multi-attribute auxiliary information and obtains its embedded presentation of different time-window sizes.The latter uses a cross-attention mechanism to construct dynamic adjacent matrices by fusing traffic data and embedded auxiliary data.Then, SAN applies diffusion GCN on traffic data to mine rich spatial-temporal dynamics.Furthermore, AIMSAN considers and uses the spatial sparseness of traffic nodes to reduce the quadratic computation complexity.Experimental results on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other counterparts in terms of various performance indices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the proposed method has competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms but saves 35.74% of GPU memory usage, 42.25% of training time, and 45.51% of validation time on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

Okapi stands out for its flexibility in security implementation.For environments with less stringent security needs, Okapi's features can be deactivated to eliminate performance overhead.When activated, the hardware modifications alone provide robust protection against transient execution attacks at a thread-level granularity, including all universal read gadgets like Spectre-PHT and Spectre-BTB.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This incurs an average performance overhead of only 3.6 % for the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>On top, Okapi introduces the OkapiReset instruction for additional software-level security support.This instruction, which can be manually inserted by developers or automatically via a compiler extension, allows for fully secure speculation and for trust domain sizes smaller than a thread.While the manual insertion of OkapiReset incurs an additional 0.6 % performance overhead, the automated compiler extension approach results in a 23.1 % overhead for making a cryptographic library fully secure.With an approximate 0.4 % hardware overhead, Okapi provides a highly scalable and adaptable solution for secure speculation in state-of-the-art processor design.</p>

                  <p>Symmetry detection, especially partial and extrinsic symmetry, is essential for various downstream tasks, like 3D geometry completion, segmentation, compression and structure-aware shape encoding or generation.In order to detect partial extrinsic symmetries, we propose to learn rotation, reflection, translation and scale invariant local shape features for geodesic point cloud patches via contrastive learning, which are robust across multiple classes and generalize over different datasets.We show that our approach is able to extract multiple valid solutions for this ambiguous problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce a novel benchmark test for partial extrinsic symmetry detection to evaluate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Lastly, we incorporate the detected symmetries together with a region growing algorithm to demonstrate a downstream task with the goal of computing symmetry-aware partitions of 3D shapes.To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a self-supervised data-driven method for partial extrinsic symmetry detection.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning models are known to suffer from the problem of bias, and researchers have been exploring methods to address this issue.However, most of these methods require prior knowledge of the bias and are not always practical.In this paper, we focus on a more practical setting with no prior information about the bias.Generally, in this setting, there are a large number of bias-aligned samples that cause the model to produce biased predictions and a few bias-conflicting samples that do not conform to the bias.If the training data is limited, the influence of the bias-aligned samples may become even stronger on the model predictions, and we experimentally demonstrate that existing debiasing techniques suffer severely in such cases.In this paper, we examine the effects of unknown bias in small dataset regimes and present a novel approach to mitigate this issue.The proposed approach directly addresses the issue of the extremely low occurrence of bias-conflicting samples in limited data settings through the synthesis of hybrid samples that can be used to reduce the effect of bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing any unknown bias in the presence of limited data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach outperforms the vanilla, LfF, LDD, and DebiAN debiasing methods by absolute margins of 10.39%, 9.08%, 8.07%, and 9.67% when only 10% of the Corrupted CIFAR-10 Type 1 dataset is available with a bias-conflicting sample ratio of 0.05. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context.Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model.This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria.We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF.As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL).DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/hidden-context</p>
