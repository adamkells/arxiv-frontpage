                  <p>Exploiting the foundation models (e.g., CLIP) to build a versatile keypoint detector has gained increasing attention.Most existing models accept either the text prompt (e.g., ``the nose of a cat''), or the visual prompt (e.g., support image with keypoint annotations), to detect the corresponding keypoints in query image, thereby, exhibiting either zero-shot or few-shot detection ability.However, the research on taking multimodal prompt is still underexplored, and the prompt diversity in semantics and language is far from opened.For example, how to handle unseen text prompts for novel keypoint detection and the diverse text prompts like ``Can you detect the nose and ears of a cat?''In this work, we open the prompt diversity from three aspects: modality, semantics (seen v.s. unseen), and language, to enable a more generalized zero- and few-shot keypoint detection (Z-FSKD).We propose a novel OpenKD model which leverages multimodal prototype set to support both visual and textual prompting.Further, to infer the keypoint location of unseen texts, we add the auxiliary keypoints and texts interpolated from visual and textual domains into training, which improves the spatial reasoning of our model and significantly enhances zero-shot novel keypoint detection.We also found large language model (LLM) is a good parser, which achieves over 96% accuracy to parse keypoints from texts.With LLM, OpenKD can handle diverse text prompts.Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Z-FSKD and initiates new ways to deal with unseen text and diverse texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/AlanLuSun/OpenKD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex systems involving structured data and relationships.Consequently, graph representation learning, which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional representations of graphs, has drawn a lot of attention in recent years.The overwhelming majority of existing methods handle unsigned graphs.However, signed graphs appear in an increasing number of application domains to model systems involving two types of opposed relationships.Several authors took an interest in signed graphs and proposed methods for providing vertex-level representations, but only one exists for whole-graph representations, and it can handle only fully connected graphs.In this article, we tackle this issue by proposing two approaches to learning whole-graph representations of general signed graphs.The first is a SG2V, a signed generalization of the whole-graph embedding method Graph2vec that relies on a modification of the Weisfeiler--Lehman relabelling procedure.The second one is WSGCN, a whole-graph generalization of the signed vertex embedding method SGCN that relies on the introduction of master nodes into the GCN.We propose several variants of both these approaches.A bottleneck in the development of whole-graph-oriented methods is the lack of data.We constitute a benchmark composed of three collections of signed graphs with corresponding ground truths.We assess our methods on this benchmark, and our results show that the signed whole-graph methods learn better representations for this task.Overall, the baseline obtains an F-measure score of 58.57, when SG2V and WSGCN reach 73.01 and 81.20, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and benchmark dataset are both publicly available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>In industrial manufacturing of glass bottles, quality control of bottle prints is necessary as numerous factors can negatively affect the printing process.Even minor defects in the bottle prints must be detected despite reflections in the glass or manufacturing-related deviations.In cooperation with our medium-sized industrial partner, two ML-based approaches for quality control of these bottle prints were developed and evaluated, which can also be used in this challenging scenario.Our first approach utilized different filters to supress reflections (e.g. Sobel or Canny) and image quality metrics for image comparison (e.g. MSE or SSIM) as features for different supervised classification models (e.g. SVM or k-Neighbors), which resulted in an accuracy of 84%.The images were aligned based on the ORB algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the rotations of the prints, which may serve as an indicator for anomalies in the manufacturing process.In our second approach, we fine-tuned different pre-trained CNN models (e.g. ResNet or VGG) for binary classification, which resulted in an accuracy of 87%.Utilizing Grad-Cam on our fine-tuned ResNet-34, we were able to localize and visualize frequently defective bottle print regions.This method allowed us to provide insights that could be used to optimize the actual manufacturing process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper also describes our general approach and the challenges we encountered in practice with data collection during ongoing production, unsupervised preselection, and labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine learning models are increasingly being deployed in real-world contexts.However, systematic studies on their transferability to specific and critical applications are underrepresented in the research literature.An important example is visual anomaly detection (VAD) for robotic power line inspection.While existing VAD methods perform well in controlled environments, real-world scenarios present diverse and unexpected anomalies that current datasets fail to capture.To address this gap, we introduce $\textit{CableInspect-AD}$, a high-quality, publicly available dataset created and annotated by domain experts from Hydro-Qu\'ebec, a Canadian public utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset includes high-resolution images with challenging real-world anomalies, covering defects with varying severity levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span>To address the challenges of collecting diverse anomalous and nominal examples for setting a detection threshold, we propose an enhancement to the celebrated PatchCore algorithm.This enhancement enables its use in scenarios with limited labeled data.We also present a comprehensive evaluation protocol based on cross-validation to assess models' performances.We evaluate our $\textit{Enhanced-PatchCore}$ for few-shot and many-shot detection, and Vision-Language Models for zero-shot detection.While promising, these models struggle to detect all anomalies, highlighting the dataset's value as a challenging benchmark for the broader research community.Project page: https://mila-iqia.github.io/cableinspect-ad/.</p>

                  <p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks.However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge.To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities.In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM.Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification.To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector.Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains.We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics.Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

In this paper, we present SelectiveKD, a semi-supervised learning framework for building cancer detection models for DBT, which only requires a limited number of annotated slices to reach high performance.We achieve this by utilizing unlabeled slices available in a DBT stack through a knowledge distillation framework in which the teacher model provides a supervisory signal to the student model for all slices in the DBT volume.Our framework mitigates the potential noise in the supervisory signal from a sub-optimal teacher by implementing a selective dataset expansion strategy using pseudo labels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach with a large-scale real-world dataset of over 10,000 DBT exams collected from multiple device manufacturers and locations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>The resulting SelectiveKD process effectively utilizes unannotated slices from a DBT stack, leading to significantly improved cancer classification performance (AUC) and generalization performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in natural language processing and the increased use of large language models have exposed new security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks.Previous backdoor attacks require input manipulation after model distribution to activate the backdoor, posing limitations in real-world applicability.Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel Claim-Guided Backdoor Attack (CGBA), which eliminates the need for such manipulations by utilizing inherent textual claims as triggers.CGBA leverages claim extraction, clustering, and targeted training to trick models to misbehave on targeted claims without affecting their performance on clean data.CGBA demonstrates its effectiveness and stealthiness across various datasets and models, significantly enhancing the feasibility of practical backdoor attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/PaperCGBA/CGBA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date.However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively.Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts.In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts.We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale.Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks.Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb.Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens.Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Code: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ProX</p>

                  <p>Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks.Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources.Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization.However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances.This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy.Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness.Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration.First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency.Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Data heterogeneity among Federated Learning (FL) users poses a significant challenge, resulting in reduced global model performance.The community has designed various techniques to tackle this issue, among which Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based techniques are common.   While these techniques effectively improve performance under high heterogeneity, they inadvertently cause higher accuracy degradation under model poisoning attacks (known as attack amplification).This paper presents a case study to reveal this critical vulnerability in KD-based FL systems.We show why KD causes this issue through empirical evidence and use it as motivation to design a hybrid distillation technique.We introduce a novel algorithm, Hybrid Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Accurate FL (HYDRA-FL),   which reduces the impact of attacks in attack scenarios by offloading some of the KD loss to a shallow layer via an auxiliary classifier.We model HYDRA-FL as a generic framework and adapt it to two KD-based FL algorithms, FedNTD and MOON.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these two as case studies, we demonstrate that our technique outperforms baselines in attack settings while maintaining comparable performance in benign settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cross-lingual cross-modal retrieval (CCR) aims to retrieve visually relevant content based on non-English queries, without relying on human-labeled cross-modal data pairs during training.One popular approach involves utilizing machine translation (MT) to create pseudo-parallel data pairs, establishing correspondence between visual and non-English textual data.However, aligning their representations poses challenges due to the significant semantic gap between vision and text, as well as the lower quality of non-English representations caused by pre-trained encoders and data noise.To overcome these challenges, we propose LECCR, a novel solution that incorporates the multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to improve the alignment between visual and non-English representations.Specifically, we first employ MLLM to generate detailed visual content descriptions and aggregate them into multi-view semantic slots that encapsulate different semantics.Then, we take these semantic slots as internal features and leverage them to interact with the visual features.By doing so, we enhance the semantic information within the visual features, narrowing the semantic gap between modalities and generating local visual semantics for subsequent multi-level matching.Additionally, to further enhance the alignment between visual and non-English features, we introduce softened matching under English guidance.This approach provides more comprehensive and reliable inter-modal correspondences between visual and non-English features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four CCR benchmarks, \ie Multi30K, MSCOCO, VATEX, and MSR-VTT-CN, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Code: \url{https://github.com/LiJiaBei-7/leccr}.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Solving partial differential equations has shifted the focus of traditional neural network studies from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to generalized functional spaces in research.A novel methodology is to learn an operator as a means of approximating the mapping between outputs.Currently, researchers have proposed a variety of operator architectures.Nevertheless, the majority of these architectures adopt an iterative update architecture, whereby a single operator is learned from the same function space.In practical physical science problems, the numerical solutions of partial differential equations are complex, and a serial single operator is unable to accurately approximate the intricate mapping between input and output.So, We propose a deep parallel operator model (DPNO) for efficiently and accurately solving partial differential equations.DPNO employs convolutional neural networks to extract local features and map data into distinct latent spaces.Designing a parallel block of double Fourier neural operators to solve the iterative error problem.DPNO approximates complex mappings between inputs and outputs by learning multiple operators in different potential spaces in parallel blocks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DPNO achieved the best performance on five of them, with an average improvement of 10.5\%, and ranked second on one dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>The detection of depression in social media posts is crucial due to the increasing prevalence of mental health issues.Traditional machine learning algorithms often fail to capture intricate textual patterns, limiting their effectiveness in identifying depression.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing studies have explored various approaches to this problem but often fall short in terms of accuracy and robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>To address these limitations, this research proposes a neural network architecture leveraging transformer-based models combined with metadata and linguistic markers.The study employs DistilBERT, extracting information from the last four layers of the transformer, applying learned weights, and averaging them to create a rich representation of the input text.This representation, augmented by metadata and linguistic markers, enhances the model's comprehension of each post.Dropout layers prevent overfitting, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is used for final classification.Data augmentation techniques, inspired by the Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) methods, are also employed to improve model performance.Using BERT, random insertion and substitution of phrases generate additional training data, focusing on balancing the dataset by augmenting underrepresented classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed model achieves weighted Precision, Recall, and F1-scores of 84.26%, 84.18%, and 84.15%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The augmentation techniques significantly enhance model performance, increasing the weighted F1-score from 72.59% to 84.15%.</p>

                  <p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex systems involving structured data and relationships.Consequently, graph representation learning, which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional representations of graphs, has drawn a lot of attention in recent years.The overwhelming majority of existing methods handle unsigned graphs.However, signed graphs appear in an increasing number of application domains to model systems involving two types of opposed relationships.Several authors took an interest in signed graphs and proposed methods for providing vertex-level representations, but only one exists for whole-graph representations, and it can handle only fully connected graphs.In this article, we tackle this issue by proposing two approaches to learning whole-graph representations of general signed graphs.The first is a SG2V, a signed generalization of the whole-graph embedding method Graph2vec that relies on a modification of the Weisfeiler--Lehman relabelling procedure.The second one is WSGCN, a whole-graph generalization of the signed vertex embedding method SGCN that relies on the introduction of master nodes into the GCN.We propose several variants of both these approaches.A bottleneck in the development of whole-graph-oriented methods is the lack of data.We constitute a benchmark composed of three collections of signed graphs with corresponding ground truths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We assess our methods on this benchmark, and our results show that the signed whole-graph methods learn better representations for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the baseline obtains an F-measure score of 58.57, when SG2V and WSGCN reach 73.01 and 81.20, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Our source code and benchmark dataset are both publicly available online.</p>

                  <p>Crack segmentation is crucial in civil engineering, particularly for assessing pavement integrity and ensuring the durability of infrastructure.While deep learning has advanced RGB-based segmentation, performance degrades under adverse conditions like low illumination or motion blur.Thermal imaging offers complementary information by capturing emitted radiation, improving crack detection in challenging environments.Combining RGB and thermal images (RGB-T) for crack segmentation shows promise in complex real-world conditions, such as adverse weather, yet research in this area remains limited.Current RGB-T segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities at various levels of interaction.To address this, we propose IRFusionFormer, a novel model for crack segmentation that effectively integrates RGB and thermal data.Our Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module captures multi-scale relationships and long-range dependencies between modalities without significant computational overhead.Additionally, we introduce the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision framework, which enhances interaction between modalities by distributing fused features across branches with joint supervision.To maintain the topological structure of cracks, we introduce a novel topology-based loss function that preserves connectivity during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 90.01% and an IoU of 81.83%, significantly improving robustness and accuracy in varying environmental conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>These advancements address key challenges in pavement crack segmentation, offering a more reliable and efficient solution.For access to the codes, data, and models from this study, visit https://github.com/sheauhuu/IRFusionFormer</p>

                  <p>Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image.Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning.However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions.This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion.Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple.In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated.In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding.Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks.Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch.This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed.Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>Codes and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/SimVG}.</p>

                  <p>Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks.Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources.Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization.However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances.This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy.Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness.Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration.First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity.Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness.By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has emerged as a promising approach since it does not rely on labeled training data.Most methods combine convolution and Transformer to model long-distance dependencies to estimate depth accurately.However, Transformer treats 2D image features as 1D sequences, and positional encoding somewhat mitigates the loss of spatial information between different feature blocks, tending to overlook channel features, which limit the performance of depth estimation.In this paper, we propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network to get finer details.Specifically, we propose a decoder based on large kernel attention, which can model long-distance dependencies without compromising the two-dimension structure of features while maintaining feature channel adaptivity.In addition, we introduce a up-sampling module to accurately recover the fine details in the depth map.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves competitive results on the KITTI dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning from large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation.However, inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it difficult to apply SSP to CMR.Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP methods for CMR cine segmentation.   To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM).Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch.The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available.Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance.However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-intensive, rendering frequent retraining or updates impractical.Consequently, time-sensitive data can become outdated, potentially misleading LLMs in time-aware tasks.For example, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various programs every day.Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities.Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue.   To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>Online-to-offline (O2O) food delivery platforms have substantially enriched the food choices of urban residents by allowing them to conveniently access farther food outlets.However, concerns about the healthiness of delivered food persist, especially because the impact of O2O food delivery platforms on users' healthy food choices remains unclear.This study leverages large-scale empirical data from a leading O2O delivery platform to comprehensively analyze online food choice behaviors and how they are influenced by the online exposure to fast food restaurants, i.e., online food environment.Our analyses reveal significant discrepancy in food preferences across demographic groups and city sizes, where male, low-income, and younger users and those located in larger cities more likely to order fast food via O2O platforms.Besides, we also perform a comparative analysis on the food exposure differences in online and offline environments, confirming that the extended service ranges of O2O platforms can create larger "cyber food swamps".Furthermore, regression analysis highlights that a higher ratio of fast food orders is associated with "cyber food swamps", areas characterized by a higher share of accessible fast food restaurants.A 10% increase in this share raises the probability of ordering fast food by 22.0%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a quasi-natural experiment substantiates the long-term causal effect of online food environment changes on healthy food choices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Our findings underscore the need for O2O food delivery platforms to address the health implications of online food choice exposure, thereby informing efforts by various stakeholders to improve residents' dietary health.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain integration in industries like online advertising is hindered by its connectivity limitations to off-chain data.These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems for collecting and analyzing off-chain data.This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts.However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge.   To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems.In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake.Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract.Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available.Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters.In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty.</p>

                  <p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code.Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved.To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews.Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation.Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture.However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training.This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback.To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality.Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function.Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour.Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions.For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data.Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the Gaussian derivative networks achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks.   We first experimentally demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales.Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties.We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation.   In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of Gaussian derivative networks, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have very good explainability properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains, including Web search, healthcare, and software development.However, as these models scale, they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, particularly backdoor attacks.By exploiting the potent memorization capacity of LLMs, adversaries can easily inject backdoors into LLMs by manipulating a small portion of training data, leading to malicious behaviors in downstream applications whenever the hidden backdoor is activated by the pre-defined triggers.Moreover, emerging learning paradigms like instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) exacerbate these risks as they rely heavily on crowdsourced data and human feedback, which are not fully controlled.In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of emerging backdoor threats to LLMs that appear during LLM development or inference, and cover recent advancement in both defense and detection strategies for mitigating backdoor threats to LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also outline key challenges in addressing these threats, highlighting areas for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM).However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives).Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations.This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize.In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO).The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner.It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding.Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding.Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses.This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p>

The software on the OBC commands the robot's joints via SpaceWire to perform those mission tasks, reads camera images and data from additional sensors and sends telemetry data through an Ethernet link via the spacecraft down to Earth.It is set up to execute a predefined mission after receiving a start signal from the spacecraft while it should be extendable to receive commands from Earth for later missions.Core design principle was to reuse as much existing software and to stay as close as possible to existing robot software stacks at DLR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This allowed for a quick full operational start of the robot arm compared to a custom development of all robot software, a lower entry barrier for software developers as well as a reuse of existing libraries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While not every line of code can be tested with this design, most of the software has already proven its functionality through daily execution on multiple robot systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>The widespread success of deep learning models today is owed to the curation of extensive datasets significant in size and complexity.However, such models frequently pick up inherent biases in the data during the training process, leading to unreliable predictions.Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance.In this paper, we present CONBIAS, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets.CONBIAS represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset.Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks.Extensive experiments show that data augmentation based on a balanced concept distribution augmented by CONBIAS improves generalization performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make our code and data publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span></p>

                  <p>We develop formal privacy mechanisms for releasing statistics from data with many outlying values, such as income data.These mechanisms ensure that a per-record differential privacy guarantee degrades slowly in the protected records' influence on the statistics being released.   Formal privacy mechanisms generally add randomness, or "noise," to published statistics.If a noisy statistic's distribution changes little with the addition or deletion of a single record in the underlying dataset, an attacker looking at this statistic will find it plausible that any particular record was present or absent, preserving the records' privacy.More influential records -- those whose addition or deletion would change the statistics' distribution more -- typically suffer greater privacy loss.The per-record differential privacy framework quantifies these record-specific privacy guarantees, but existing mechanisms let these guarantees degrade rapidly (linearly or quadratically) with influence.While this may be acceptable in cases with some moderately influential records, it results in unacceptably high privacy losses when records' influence varies widely, as is common in economic data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop mechanisms with privacy guarantees that instead degrade as slowly as logarithmically with influence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>These mechanisms allow for the accurate, unbiased release of statistics, while providing meaningful protection for highly influential records.As an example, we consider the private release of sums of unbounded establishment data such as payroll, where our mechanisms extend meaningful privacy protection even to very large establishments.We evaluate these mechanisms empirically and demonstrate their utility.</p>

                  <p>Early detection of diseases in crops is essential to prevent harvest losses and improve the quality of the final product.In this context, the combination of machine learning and proximity sensors is emerging as a technique capable of achieving this detection efficiently and effectively.For example, this machine learning approach has been applied to potato crops -- to detect late blight (Phytophthora infestans) -- and grapevine crops -- to detect downy mildew.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, most of these AI models found in the specialised literature have been developed using leaf-by-leaf images taken in the lab, which does not represent field conditions and limits their applicability.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>In this study, we present the first machine learning model capable of detecting mild symptoms of late blight in potato crops through the analysis of high-resolution RGB images captured directly in the field, overcoming the limitations of other publications in the literature and presenting real-world applicability.Our proposal exploits the availability of high-resolution images via the concept of patching, and is based on deep convolutional neural networks with a focal loss function, which makes the model to focus on the complex patterns that arise in field conditions.Additionally, we present a data augmentation scheme that facilitates the training of these neural networks with few high-resolution images, which allows for development of models under the small data paradigm.   Our model correctly detects all cases of late blight in the test dataset, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and effectiveness in identifying early symptoms.These promising results reinforce the potential use of machine learning for the early detection of diseases and pests in agriculture, enabling better treatment and reducing their impact on crops.</p>
