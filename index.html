                  <p>Autoformalization, the conversion of natural language mathematics into formal languages, offers significant potential for advancing mathematical reasoning.However, existing efforts are limited to formal languages with substantial online corpora and struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving languages like Lean 4.To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark \textbf{Form}alization for \textbf{L}ean~\textbf{4} (\textbf{\name}) designed to evaluate the autoformalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs).This benchmark encompasses a comprehensive assessment of questions, answers, formal statements, and proofs.Additionally, we introduce a \textbf{P}rocess-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{V}erifier (\textbf{PSV}) model that leverages the precise feedback from Lean 4 compilers to enhance autoformalization.Our experiments demonstrate that the PSV method improves autoformalization, enabling higher accuracy using less filtered training data.Furthermore, when fine-tuned with data containing detailed process information, PSV can leverage the data more effectively, leading to more significant improvements in autoformalization for Lean 4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/rookie-joe/PDA}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Much of the research in social computing analyzes data from social media platforms, which may inherently carry biases.An overlooked source of such bias is the over-representation of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) populations, which might not accurately mirror the global demographic diversity.We evaluated the dependence on WEIRD populations in research presented at the AAAI ICWSM conference; the only venue whose proceedings are fully dedicated to social computing research.We did so by analyzing 494 papers published from 2018 to 2022, which included full research papers, dataset papers and posters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After filtering out papers that analyze synthetic datasets or those lacking clear country of origin, we were left with 420 papers from which 188 participants in a crowdsourcing study with full manual validation extracted data for the WEIRD scores computation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>This data was then used to adapt existing WEIRD metrics to be applicable for social media data.We found that 37% of these papers focused solely on data from Western countries.This percentage is significantly less than the percentages observed in research from CHI (76%) and FAccT (84%) conferences, suggesting a greater diversity of dataset origins within ICWSM.However, the studies at ICWSM still predominantly examine populations from countries that are more Educated, Industrialized, and Rich in comparison to those in FAccT, with a special note on the 'Democratic' variable reflecting political freedoms and rights.This points out the utility of social media data in shedding light on findings from countries with restricted political freedoms.Based on these insights, we recommend extensions of current "paper checklists" to include considerations about the WEIRD bias and call for the community to broaden research inclusivity by encouraging the use of diverse datasets from underrepresented regions.</p>

                  <p>To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as conscious agents with generalizable reasoning capabilities, it is crucial that they possess the reasoning ability to comprehend situational changes (transitions) in distribution triggered by environmental factors or actions from other agents.Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with situational transitions.Addressing these gaps, we propose a novel formulation of reasoning with distributional changes as a three-step discriminative process, termed as MetAphysical ReaSoning.We then introduce the first-ever benchmark, MARS, comprising three tasks corresponding to each step.These tasks systematically assess LLMs' capabilities in reasoning the plausibility of (i) changes in actions, (ii) states caused by changed actions, and (iii) situational transitions driven by changes in action.Extensive evaluations with 20 (L)LMs of varying sizes and methods indicate that all three tasks in this process pose significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art LLMs and LMs after fine-tuning.Further analyses reveal potential causes for the underperformance of LLMs and demonstrate that pre-training them on large-scale conceptualization taxonomies can potentially enhance their metaphysical reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MARS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mental illness remains one of the most critical public health issues, with a significant gap between the available mental health support and patient needs.Many mental health professionals highlight a disconnect between their training and real-world patient interactions, leaving some trainees feeling unprepared and potentially affecting their early career success.In this paper, we propose PATIENT-{\Psi}, a novel patient simulation framework for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) training.To build PATIENT-{\Psi}, we constructed diverse patient profiles and their corresponding cognitive models based on CBT principles, and then used large language models (LLMs) programmed with the patient cognitive models to act as a simulated therapy patient.We propose an interactive training scheme, PATIENT-{\Psi}-TRAINER, for mental health trainees to practice a key skill in CBT -- formulating the cognitive model of the patient -- through role-playing a therapy session with PATIENT-{\Psi}.To evaluate PATIENT-{\Psi}, we conducted a user study of 4 mental health trainees and 10 experts.The results demonstrate that practice using PATIENT-{\Psi}-TRAINER greatly enhances the perceived skill acquisition and confidence of the trainees beyond existing forms of training such as textbooks, videos, and role-play with non-patients.Based on the experts' perceptions, PATIENT-{\Psi} is perceived to be closer to real patient interactions than GPT-4, and PATIENT-{\Psi}-TRAINER holds strong promise to improve trainee competencies.Our pioneering patient simulation training framework, using LLMs, holds great potential to enhance and advance mental health training, ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release all our data, code, and the training platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span></p>

                  <p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation.To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity.Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers.   In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences.Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning.We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively.In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj.Experimental results on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search.Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the significant challenge of recognizing behaviors in non-human primates, specifically focusing on chimpanzees.Automated behavior recognition is crucial for both conservation efforts and the advancement of behavioral research.However, it is significantly hindered by the labor-intensive process of manual video annotation.Despite the availability of large-scale animal behavior datasets, the effective application of machine learning models across varied environmental settings poses a critical challenge, primarily due to the variability in data collection contexts and the specificity of annotations.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce ChimpBehave, a novel dataset featuring over 2 hours of video (approximately 193,000 video frames) of zoo-housed chimpanzees, meticulously annotated with bounding boxes and behavior labels for action recognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>ChimpBehave uniquely aligns its behavior classes with existing datasets, allowing for the study of domain adaptation and cross-dataset generalization methods between different visual settings.Furthermore, we benchmark our dataset using a state-of-the-art CNN-based action recognition model, providing the first baseline results for both within and cross-dataset settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, models, and code can be accessed at: https://github.com/MitchFuchs/ChimpBehave <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.918</span></span></p>

                  <p>A composite source, consisting of multiple subsources and a memoryless switch, outputs one symbol at a time from the subsource selected by the switch.If some data should be encoded more accurately than other data from an information source, the composite source model is suitable because in this model different distortion constraints can be put on the subsources.In this context, we propose subsource-dependent fidelity criteria for composite sources and use them to formulate a rate-distortion problem.We solve the problem and obtain a single-letter expression for the rate-distortion function.Further rate-distortion analysis characterizes the performance of classify-then-compress (CTC) coding, which is frequently used in practice when subsource-dependent fidelity criteria are considered.Our analysis shows that CTC coding generally has performance loss relative to optimal coding, even if the classification is perfect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also identify the cause of the performance loss, that is, class labels have to be reproduced in CTC coding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Last but not least, we show that the performance loss is negligible for asymptotically small distortion if CTC coding is appropriately designed and some mild conditions are satisfied.</p>

                  <p>Head pose estimation (HPE) task requires a sophisticated understanding of 3D spatial relationships and precise numerical output of yaw, pitch, and roll Euler angles.Previous HPE studies are mainly based on Non-large language models (Non-LLMs), which rely on close-up human heads cropped from the full image as inputs and lack robustness in real-world scenario.In this paper, we present a novel framework to enhance the HPE prediction task by leveraging the visual grounding capability of CogVLM.CogVLM is a vision language model (VLM) with grounding capability of predicting object bounding boxes (BBoxes), which enables HPE training and prediction using full image information input.To integrate the HPE task into the VLM, we first cop with the catastrophic forgetting problem in large language models (LLMs) by investigating the rehearsal ratio in the data rehearsal method.Then, we propose and validate a LoRA layer-based model merging method, which keeps the integrity of parameters, to enhance the HPE performance in the framework.The results show our HPE-CogVLM achieves a 31.5\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error for HPE prediction over the current Non-LLM based state-of-the-art in cross-dataset evaluation.Furthermore, we compare our LoRA layer-based model merging method with LoRA fine-tuning only and other merging methods in CogVLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate our framework outperforms them in all HPE metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Transformers, which incorporate self-attention and positional encoding, have recently emerged as a powerful architecture for various graph learning tasks.Despite their impressive performance, the complex non-convex interactions across layers and the recursive graph structure have made it challenging to establish a theoretical foundation for learning and generalization.This study introduces the first theoretical investigation of a shallow Graph Transformer for semi-supervised node classification, comprising a self-attention layer with relative positional encoding and a two-layer perceptron.Focusing on a graph data model with discriminative nodes that determine node labels and non-discriminative nodes that are class-irrelevant, we characterize the sample complexity required to achieve a desirable generalization error by training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD).This paper provides the quantitative characterization of the sample complexity and number of iterations for convergence dependent on the fraction of discriminative nodes, the dominant patterns, and the initial model errors.Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-attention and positional encoding enhance generalization by making the attention map sparse and promoting the core neighborhood during training, which explains the superior feature representation of Graph Transformers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our theoretical results are supported by empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span></p>

                  <p>Addressing missing modalities presents a critical challenge in multimodal learning.Current approaches focus on developing models that can handle modality-incomplete inputs during inference, assuming that the full set of modalities are available for all the data during training.This reliance on full-modality data for training limits the use of abundant modality-incomplete samples that are often encountered in practical settings.In this paper, we propose a robust universal model with modality reconstruction and model personalization, which can effectively tackle the missing modality at both training and testing stages.Our method leverages a multimodal masked autoencoder to reconstruct the missing modality and masked patches simultaneously, incorporating an innovative distribution approximation mechanism to fully utilize both modality-complete and modality-incomplete data.The reconstructed modalities then contributes to our designed data-model co-distillation scheme to guide the model learning in the presence of missing modalities.Moreover, we propose a CLIP-driven hyper-network to personalize partial model parameters, enabling the model to adapt to each distinct missing modality scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method has been extensively validated on two brain tumor segmentation benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method, which consistently exceeds previous state-of-the-art approaches under the all-stage missing modality settings with different missing ratios.Code will be available.</p>

                  <p>Advancements in 6G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment.Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming.While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations.Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments.This emphasizes a critical need for more robust solutions.This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions.An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates.To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem.To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the k-means clustering and YOLOv8 model.To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that utilizes various data sources and a weighted entropy-based mechanism to predict the optimal beams.Rapid and accurate beam predictions are needed to maintain QoS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), has been proposed to quantify this. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model.Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning models excel when the data distribution during training aligns with testing data.Yet, their performance diminishes when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, leading to great interest in the field of OOD detection.Current approaches typically assume that OOD samples originate from an unconcentrated distribution complementary to the training distribution.While this assumption is appropriate in the traditional unsupervised OOD (U-OOD) setting, it proves inadequate when considering the place of deployment of the underlying deep learning model.To better reflect this real-world scenario, we introduce the novel setting of continual U-OOD detection.To tackle this new setting, we propose a method that starts from a U-OOD detector, which is agnostic to the OOD distribution, and slowly updates during deployment to account for the actual OOD distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method uses a new U-OOD scoring function that combines the Mahalanobis distance with a nearest-neighbor approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Furthermore, we design a confidence-scaled few-shot OOD detector that outperforms previous methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show our method greatly improves upon strong baselines from related fields. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning models in satellite onboard enable real-time interpretation of remote sensing images, reducing the need for data transmission to the ground and conserving communication resources.As satellite numbers and observation frequencies increase, the demand for satellite onboard real-time image interpretation grows, highlighting the expanding importance and development of this technology.However, updating the extensive parameters of models deployed on the satellites for spaceborne object detection model is challenging due to the limitations of uplink bandwidth in wireless satellite communications.To address this issue, this paper proposes a method based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning technology with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) module.It involves training low-rank matrix parameters and integrating them with the original model's weight matrix through multiplication and summation, thereby fine-tuning the model parameters to adapt to new data distributions with minimal weight updates.The proposed method combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning with full fine-tuning in the parameter update strategy of the oriented object detection algorithm architecture.This strategy enables model performance improvements close to full fine-tuning effects with minimal parameter updates.In addition, low rank approximation is conducted to pick an optimal rank value for LoRA matrices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>By fine-tuning and updating only 12.4$\%$ of the model's total parameters, it is able to achieve 97$\%$ to 100$\%$ of the performance of full fine-tuning models.Additionally, the reduced number of trainable parameters accelerates model training iterations and enhances the generalization and robustness of the oriented object detection model.The source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/fudanxu/LoRA-Det}.</p>

                  <p>The challenge of estimating similarity between sets has been a significant concern in data science, finding diverse applications across various domains.However, previous approaches, such as MinHash, have predominantly centered around hashing techniques, which are well-suited for sets but less naturally adaptable to multisets, a common occurrence in scenarios like network streams and text data.Moreover, with the increasing prevalence of data arriving in streaming patterns, many existing methods struggle to handle cases where set items are presented in a continuous stream.Consequently, our focus in this paper is on the challenging scenario of multisets with item streams.To address this, we propose SimiSketch, a sketching algorithm designed to tackle this specific problem.The paper begins by presenting two simpler versions that employ intuitive sketches for similarity estimation.Subsequently, we formally introduce SimiSketch and leverage SALSA to enhance accuracy.To validate our algorithms, we conduct extensive testing on synthetic datasets, real-world network traffic, and text articles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiment shows that compared with the state-of-the-art, SimiSketch can improve the accuracy by up to 42 times, and increase the throughput by up to 360 times. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>The complete source code is open-sourced and available on GitHub for reference.</p>

                  <p>Integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks has emerged as a promising paradigm to fulfill the constantly growing demand for connectivity, low transmission delay, and quality of services (QoS).This integration brings together the strengths of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, such as the reliability of terrestrial networks, broad coverage, and service continuity of non-terrestrial networks like low earth orbit (LEO) satellites.In this work, we study a data service maximization problem in an integrated terrestrial-non-terrestrial network (I-TNT) where the ground base stations (GBSs) and LEO satellites cooperatively serve the coexisting aerial users (AUs) and ground users (GUs).Then, by considering the spectrum scarcity, interference, and QoS requirements of the users, we jointly optimize the user association, AUE's trajectory, and power allocation.To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we disintegrate it into two subproblems: 1) user association problem and 2) trajectory and power allocation problem.Since the user association problem is a binary integer programming problem, we use the standard convex optimization method to solve it.Meanwhile, the trajectory and power allocation problem is solved by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to cope with the problem's non-convexity and dynamic network environments.Then, the two subproblems are alternately solved by the proposed iterative algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By comparing with the baselines in the existing literature, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>The security threat of backdoor attacks is a central concern for deep neural networks (DNNs).Recently, without poisoned data, unlearning models with clean data and then learning a pruning mask have contributed to backdoor defense.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, vanilla fine-tuning with those clean data can help recover the lost clean accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>However, the behavior of clean unlearning is still under-explored, and vanilla fine-tuning unintentionally induces back the backdoor effect.In this work, we first investigate model unlearning from the perspective of weight changes and gradient norms, and find two interesting observations in the backdoored model: 1) the weight changes between poison and clean unlearning are positively correlated, making it possible for us to identify the backdoored-related neurons without using poisoned data; 2) the neurons of the backdoored model are more active (i.e., larger changes in gradient norm) than those in the clean model, suggesting the need to suppress the gradient norm during fine-tuning.Then, we propose an effective two-stage defense method.In the first stage, an efficient Neuron Weight Change (NWC)-based Backdoor Reinitialization is proposed based on observation 1).In the second stage, based on observation 2), we design an Activeness-Aware Fine-Tuning to replace the vanilla fine-tuning.Extensive experiments, involving eight backdoor attacks on three benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to recent state-of-the-art backdoor defense approaches.</p>

                  <p>Network Signalling Data (NSD) have the potential to provide continuous spatio-temporal information about the presence, mobility, and usage patterns of cell phone services by individuals.Such information is invaluable for monitoring large urban areas and supporting the implementation of decision-making services.When analyzed in real time, NSD can enable the early detection of critical urban events, including fires, large accidents, stampedes, terrorist attacks, and sports and leisure gatherings, especially if these events significantly impact mobile phone network activity in the affected areas.This paper presents empirical evidence that advanced NSD can detect anomalies in mobile traffic service consumption, attributable to critical urban events, with fine spatial and temporal resolutions.We introduce two methodologies for real-time anomaly detection from multivariate time series extracted from large-scale NSD, utilizing a range of algorithms adapted from the state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection.Our research includes a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of these algorithms on a large-scale dataset of NSD service consumption for the Paris region.The evaluation uses an original dataset of documented critical or unusual urban events.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset has been built as a ground truth basis for assessing the algorithms performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The obtained results demonstrate that our framework can detect unusual events almost instantaneously and locate the affected areas with high precision, largely outperforming random classifiers.This efficiency and effectiveness underline the potential of NSD-based anomaly detection in significantly enhancing emergency response strategies and urban planning.</p>

                  <p>Collaborative edge computing has become a popular paradigm where edge devices collaborate by sharing resources.Data dissemination is a fundamental problem in CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how.Existing works on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which involves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network links.Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective.The existing works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a non-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the multi-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT).Furthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot be ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices.This work formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which includes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to minimize the sum of CCT.This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as each flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links.We propose a source and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides an initial solution considering the coflow characteristics.SCASA further improves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by leveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to 83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach that keeps data localized and often incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to enhance privacy guarantees.Similar to previous work on DP in ML, we observed that differentially private federated learning (DPFL) introduces performance disparities, particularly affecting minority groups.Recent work has attempted to address performance fairness in vanilla FL through clustering, but this method remains sensitive and prone to errors, which are further exacerbated by the DP noise in DPFL.To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel clustered DPFL algorithm designed to effectively identify clients' clusters in highly heterogeneous settings while maintaining high accuracy with DP guarantees.To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their model updates and training loss values.Our proposed approach also addresses the server's uncertainties in clustering clients' model updates by employing larger batch sizes along with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to alleviate the impact of noise and potential clustering errors, especially in privacy-sensitive scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We also extensively evaluate our approach across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets and show its effectiveness in mitigating the disparate impact of DP in FL settings with a small computational cost.</p>

                  <p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation.To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity.Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.557</span></span>Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning.We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively.In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj.Experimental results on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search.Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p>

                  <p>Many machine learning models appear to deploy effortlessly under distribution shift, and perform well on a target distribution that is considerably different from the training distribution.Yet, learning theory of distribution shift bounds performance on the target distribution as a function of the discrepancy between the source and target, rarely guaranteeing high target accuracy.Motivated by this gap, this work takes a closer look at the theory of distribution shift for a classifier from a source to a target distribution.Instead of relying on the discrepancy, we adopt an Invariant-Risk-Minimization (IRM)-like assumption connecting the distributions, and characterize conditions under which data from a source distribution is sufficient for accurate classification of the target.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When these conditions are not met, we show when only unlabeled data from the target is sufficient, and when labeled target data is needed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>In all cases, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees in the large sample regime.</p>

                  <p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable.In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability.Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage.Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting.These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations.They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces \emph{VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction)}, a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks.We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments.In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.</p>

We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms.In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem.For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.</p>

                  <p>The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities.In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest.However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.539</span></span>In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation.In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration.We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data.We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty.A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid.Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a Finite Element Method-based calibration.Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time.This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.</p>

In this paper, we show that the 3D local processing in Pangu-Weather is computationally sub-optimal.We design ArchesWeather, a transformer model that combines 2D attention with a column-wise attention-based feature interaction module, and demonstrate that this design improves forecasting skill.   ArchesWeather is trained at 1.5{\deg} resolution and 24h lead time, with a training budget of a few GPU-days and a lower inference cost than competing methods.An ensemble of two of our best models shows competitive RMSE scores with the IFS HRES and outperforms the 1.4{\deg} 50-members NeuralGCM ensemble for one day ahead forecasting.

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 have become prevalent in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive text generation performance.LLMs are fundamentally developed from a scenario where the input data remains static and lacks a clear structure.To behave interactively over time, LLM-based chat systems must integrate additional contextual information (i.e., chat history) into their inputs, following a pre-defined structure.This paper identifies how such integration can expose LLMs to misleading context from untrusted sources and fail to differentiate between system and user inputs, allowing users to inject context.We present a systematic methodology for conducting context injection attacks aimed at eliciting disallowed responses by introducing fabricated context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This could lead to illegal actions, inappropriate content, or technology misuse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>Our context fabrication strategies, acceptance elicitation and word anonymization, effectively create misleading contexts that can be structured with attacker-customized prompt templates, achieving injection through malicious user messages.Comprehensive evaluations on real-world LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 confirm the efficacy of the proposed attack with success rates reaching 97%.We also discuss potential countermeasures that can be adopted for attack detection and developing more secure models.Our findings provide insights into the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of LLMs for interactive and structured data scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Humans have an innate drive to seek out causality.Whether fuelled by curiosity or specific goals, we constantly question why things happen, how they are interconnected, and many other related phenomena.To develop AI agents capable of addressing this natural human quest for causality, we urgently need a comprehensive dataset of natural causal questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unfortunately, existing datasets either contain only artificially-crafted questions that do not reflect real AI usage scenarios or have limited coverage of questions from specific sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>To address this gap, we present CausalQuest, a dataset of 13,500 naturally occurring questions sourced from social networks, search engines, and AI assistants.We formalize the definition of causal questions and establish a taxonomy for finer-grained classification.Through a combined effort of human annotators and large language models (LLMs), we carefully label the dataset.We find that 42% of the questions humans ask are indeed causal, with the majority seeking to understand the causes behind given effects.Using this dataset, we train efficient classifiers (up to 2.85B parameters) for the binary task of identifying causal questions, achieving high performance with F1 scores of up to 0.877.We conclude with a rich set of future research directions that can build upon our data and models.</p>

                  <p>Character animation in real-world scenarios necessitates a variety of constraints, such as trajectories, key-frames, interactions, etc.Existing methodologies typically treat single or a finite set of these constraint(s) as separate control tasks.They are often specialized, and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable.We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem.In response to the complexity of practical motion control, we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem.This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks.To address this, we introduce a new paradigm, programmable motion generation.In this paradigm, any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints.These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them.We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion.Consequently, the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the required constraints.Experiments show that we can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks.These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics, geometric constraints, physical laws, interactions with scenes, objects or the character own body parts, etc.All of these are achieved in a unified approach, without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs.During the programming of novel tasks, we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model.With the assistance of large language models, we also achieved automatic programming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope that this work will pave the way for the motion control of general AI agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.599</span></span></p>
