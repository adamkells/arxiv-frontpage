                  <p>This paper presents IITP-VDLand, a comprehensive dataset of Decentraland parcels sourced from diverse platforms.Unlike existing datasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich array of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past activities, transactions, and social media interactions.Alongside, we introduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing the significant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various sources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and custom scripts, to gather it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize the information into four distinct segments: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment, (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment, and (4) Social Media Data-Fragment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We envisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>The performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our dataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R2 score of 0.8251 and an accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier.The key findings reveal that the ensemble models performs better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset.We observe a significant impact of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on the prediction of parcel prices.</p>

                  <p>The analysis and prediction of visual attention have long been crucial tasks in the fields of computer vision and image processing.In practical applications, images are generally accompanied by various text descriptions, however, few studies have explored the influence of text descriptions on visual attention, let alone developed visual saliency prediction models considering text guidance.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on text-guided image saliency (TIS) from both subjective and objective perspectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we construct a TIS database named SJTU-TIS, which includes 1200 text-image pairs and the corresponding collected eye-tracking data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>Based on the established SJTU-TIS database, we analyze the influence of various text descriptions on visual attention.Then, to facilitate the development of saliency prediction models considering text influence, we construct a benchmark for the established SJTU-TIS database using state-of-the-art saliency models.Finally, considering the effect of text descriptions on visual attention, while most existing saliency models ignore this impact, we further propose a text-guided saliency (TGSal) prediction model, which extracts and integrates both image features and text features to predict the image saliency under various text-description conditions.Our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models on both the SJTU-TIS database and the pure image saliency databases in terms of various evaluation metrics.The SJTU-TIS database and the code of the proposed TGSal model will be released at: https://github.com/IntMeGroup/TGSal.</p>

                  <p>Research on language technology for the development of medical applications is currently a hot topic in Natural Language Understanding and Generation.Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction.While these LLMs display competitive performance on automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated with a focus on a single language (English mostly).This is particularly true of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>This new corpus has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text multilingual model for the medical domain.Additionally, we present two new evaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating multilingual research in this domain.A comprehensive evaluation shows that Medical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models for the Spanish, French, and Italian benchmarks, while being competitive with current state-of-the-art LLMs in English.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents that accomplish complex computer tasks with minimal human interventions have the potential to transform human-computer interaction, significantly enhancing accessibility and productivity.However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability.To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications.Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation.Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants.While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge.Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable insights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, environment, baseline models, and data are publicly available at https://os-world.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images.However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur.In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data.Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS.The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background.Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations.By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss.Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs.It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be made available for public access. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span></p>

                  <p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems.Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals.Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli.Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states.Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations.To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds.In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids.Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective.We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations.In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction.Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals.Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data.We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.887</span></span>We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module.Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p>

                  <p>Traditional defect classification approaches are facing with two barriers.(1) Insufficient training data and unstable data quality.Collecting sufficient defective sample is expensive and time-costing, consequently leading to dataset variance.It introduces the difficulty on recognition and learning.(2) Over-dependence on visual modality.When the image pattern and texture is monotonic for all defect classes in a given dataset, the performance of conventional AOI system cannot be guaranteed.In scenarios where image quality is compromised due to mechanical failures or when defect information is inherently difficult to discern, the performance of deep models cannot be guaranteed.A main question is, "how to solve those two problems when they occur at the same time?"The feasible strategy is to explore another feature within dataset and combine an eminent vision-language model (VLM) and Large-Language model (LLM) with their astonishing zero-shot capability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose the special ASE dataset, including rich data description recorded on image, for defect classification, but the defect feature is uneasy to learn directly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span>Secondly, We present the prompting for VLM-LLM against defect classification with the proposed ASE dataset to activate extra-modality feature from images to enhance performance.Then, We design the novel progressive feature alignment (PFA) block to refine image-text feature to alleviate the difficulty of alignment under few-shot scenario.Finally, the proposed Cross-modality attention fusion (CMAF) module can effectively fuse different modality feature.Experiment results have demonstrated our method's effectiveness over several defect classification methods for the ASE dataset.</p>

                  <p>Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) aims to capture a sequence of video frames with only a single shot of a 2D detector, whose backbones rest in optical modulation patterns (also known as masks) and a computational reconstruction algorithm.Advanced deep learning algorithms and mature hardware are putting video SCI into practical applications.Yet, there are two clouds in the sunshine of SCI: i) low dynamic range as a victim of high temporal multiplexing, and ii) existing deep learning algorithms' degradation on real system.To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep optics framework to jointly optimize masks and a reconstruction network.Specifically, we first propose a new type of structural mask to realize motion-aware and full-dynamic-range measurement.Considering the motion awareness property in measurement domain, we develop an efficient network for video SCI reconstruction using Transformer to capture long-term temporal dependencies, dubbed Res2former.Moreover, sensor response is introduced into the forward model of video SCI to guarantee end-to-end model training close to real system.Finally, we implement the learned structural masks on a digital micro-mirror device.Experimental results on synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.We believe this is a milestone for real-world video SCI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/pwangcs/DeepOpticsSCI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span></p>

Due to constraints related to user health privacy and meal scenario characteristics, the collection of data that includes both meal-course affiliation and two levels of interactions is impeded.Therefore, a simulation method is adopted to derive meal-course affiliation and user-meal interaction from the user's dining sessions simulated based on user-course interaction data.Then, two well-known nutritional standards are used to calculate the healthiness scores of meals.Moreover, we experiment with several baseline models, including separate and cooperative interaction learning methods.Our experiment demonstrates that cooperating the two levels of interaction in appropriate ways is beneficial for meal recommendations.Furthermore, in response to the less healthy recommendation phenomenon found in the experiment, we explore methods to enhance the healthiness of meal recommendations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is available on GitHub (https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/MealRecPlus). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.916</span></span></p>

                  <p>For a complete comprehension of multi-person scenes, it is essential to go beyond basic tasks like detection and tracking.Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial.Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks.To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data.The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable and data efficient representations of motion in human crowded scenes.Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints' trajectory in the frequency domain.After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks.Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists.Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views.Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold.First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back).Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered.This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator.In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts.We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images.The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span></p>

                  <p>Key-value sequence data has become ubiquitous and naturally appears in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from the user-product purchasing sequences in e-commerce, to network packet sequences forwarded by routers in networking.Classifying these key-value sequences is important in many scenarios such as user profiling and malicious applications identification.In many time-sensitive scenarios, besides the requirement of classifying a key-value sequence accurately, it is also desired to classify a key-value sequence early, in order to respond fast.However, these two goals are conflicting in nature, and it is challenging to achieve them simultaneously.In this work, we formulate a novel tangled key-value sequence early classification problem, where a tangled key-value sequence is a mixture of several concurrent key-value sequences with different keys.The goal is to classify each individual key-value sequence sharing a same key both accurately and early.To address this problem, we propose a novel method, i.e., Key-Value sequence Early Co-classification (KVEC), which leverages both inner- and inter-correlations of items in a tangled key-value sequence through key correlation and value correlation to learn a better sequence representation.Meanwhile, a time-aware halting policy decides when to stop the ongoing key-value sequence and classify it based on current sequence representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KVEC improves the prediction accuracy by up to $4.7 - 17.5\%$ under the same prediction earliness condition, and improves the harmonic mean of accuracy and earliness by up to $3.7 - 14.0\%$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Novel view synthesis aims to generate new view images of a given view image collection.Recent attempts address this problem relying on 3D geometry priors (e.g., shapes, sizes, and positions) learned from multi-view images.However, such methods encounter the following limitations: 1) they require a set of multi-view images as training data for a specific scene (e.g., face, car or chair), which is often unavailable in many real-world scenarios; 2) they fail to extract the geometry priors from single-view images due to the lack of multi-view supervision.In this paper, we propose a Geometry-enhanced NeRF (G-NeRF), which seeks to enhance the geometry priors by a geometry-guided multi-view synthesis approach, followed by a depth-aware training.In the synthesis process, inspired that existing 3D GAN models can unconditionally synthesize high-fidelity multi-view images, we seek to adopt off-the-shelf 3D GAN models, such as EG3D, as a free source to provide geometry priors through synthesizing multi-view data.Simultaneously, to further improve the geometry quality of the synthetic data, we introduce a truncation method to effectively sample latent codes within 3D GAN models.To tackle the absence of multi-view supervision for single-view images, we design the depth-aware training approach, incorporating a depth-aware discriminator to guide geometry priors through depth maps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>The surface quality inspection of manufacturing parts based on 3D point cloud data has attracted increasing attention in recent years.The reason is that the 3D point cloud can capture the entire surface of manufacturing parts, unlike the previous practices that focus on some key product characteristics.However, achieving accurate 3D anomaly detection is challenging, due to the complex surfaces of manufacturing parts and the difficulty of collecting sufficient anomaly samples.To address these challenges, we propose a novel untrained anomaly detection method based on 3D point cloud data for complex manufacturing parts, which can achieve accurate anomaly detection in a single sample without training data.In the proposed framework, we transform an input sample into two sets of profiles along different directions.Based on one set of the profiles, a novel segmentation module is devised to segment the complex surface into multiple basic and simple components.In each component, another set of profiles, which have the nature of similar shapes, can be modeled as a low-rank matrix.Thus, accurate 3D anomaly detection can be achieved by using Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) on these low-rank matrices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive numerical experiments on different types of parts show that our method achieves promising results compared with the benchmark methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting accurate normal maps of objects from two-dimensional images in regions of complex structure and spatial material variations is challenging using photometric stereo methods due to the influence of surface reflection properties caused by variations in object geometry and surface materials.To address this issue, we propose a photometric stereo network called a RMAFF-PSN that uses residual multiscale attentional feature fusion to handle the ``difficult'' regions of the object.Unlike previous approaches that only use stacked convolutional layers to extract deep features from the input image, our method integrates feature information from different resolution stages and scales of the image.This approach preserves more physical information, such as texture and geometry of the object in complex regions, through shallow-deep stage feature extraction, double branching enhancement, and attention optimization.To test the network structure under real-world conditions, we propose a new real dataset called Simple PS data, which contains multiple objects with varying structures and materials.Experimental results on a publicly available benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms most existing calibrated photometric stereo methods for the same number of input images, especially in the case of highly non-convex object structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method also obtains good results under sparse lighting conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios.Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains.However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost.More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm.In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding.Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality.This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors.Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using electroencephalography (EEG) has garnered attention from researchers.EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes.Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features.Yet, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD.Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined.Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure (k-PDTM) for approximating ideal point clouds.Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information.Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings.Finally, persistence image (PI) method is utilized to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 85.60%, 83.61%, and 88.33%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable results for image generation, editing and inpainting.Recent works explore diffusion models for 3D shape generation with neural implicit functions, i.e., signed distance function and occupancy function.However, they are limited to shapes with closed surfaces, which prevents them from generating diverse 3D real-world contents containing open surfaces.In this work, we present UDiFF, a 3D diffusion model for unsigned distance fields (UDFs) which is capable to generate textured 3D shapes with open surfaces from text conditions or unconditionally.Our key idea is to generate UDFs in spatial-frequency domain with an optimal wavelet transformation, which produces a compact representation space for UDF generation.Specifically, instead of selecting an appropriate wavelet transformation which requires expensive manual efforts and still leads to large information loss, we propose a data-driven approach to learn the optimal wavelet transformation for UDFs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate UDiFF to show our advantages by numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods on widely used benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/UDiFF.</p>

                  <p>Background:Sleep staging is a fundamental component in the diagnosis of sleep disorders and the management of sleep health.Traditionally, this analysis is conducted in clinical settings and involves a time-consuming scoring procedure.Recent data-driven algorithms for sleep staging, using the photoplethysmogram (PPG) time series, have shown high performance on local test sets but lower performance on external datasets due to data drift.Methods:This study aimed to develop a generalizable deep learning model for the task of four class (wake, light, deep, and rapid eye movement (REM)) sleep staging from raw PPG physiological time-series.Six sleep datasets, totaling 2,574 patients recordings, were used.In order to create a more generalizable representation, we developed and evaluated a deep learning model called SleepPPG-Net2, which employs a multi-source domain training approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SleepPPG-Net2 was benchmarked against two state-of-the-art models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results: SleepPPG-Net2 showed consistently higher performance over benchmark approaches, with generalization performance (Cohen's kappa) improving by up to 19%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Performance disparities were observed in relation to age, sex, and sleep apnea severity.Conclusion: SleepPPG-Net2 sets a new standard for staging sleep from raw PPG time-series.</p>

                  <p>Surrounding perceptions are quintessential for safe driving for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), where the Bird's Eye View has been employed to accurately capture spatial relationships among vehicles.However, severe inherent limitations of BEV, like blind spots, have been identified.Collaborative perception has emerged as an effective solution to overcoming these limitations through data fusion from multiple views of surrounding vehicles.While most existing collaborative perception strategies adopt a fully connected graph predicated on fairness in transmissions, they often neglect the varying importance of individual vehicles due to channel variations and perception redundancy.To address these challenges, we propose a novel Priority-Aware Collaborative Perception (PACP) framework to employ a BEV-match mechanism to determine the priority levels based on the correlation between nearby CAVs and the ego vehicle for perception.By leveraging submodular optimization, we find near-optimal transmission rates, link connectivity, and compression metrics.Moreover, we deploy a deep learning-based adaptive autoencoder to modulate the image reconstruction quality under dynamic channel conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we conduct extensive studies and demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes by 8.27% and 13.60%, respectively, in terms of utility and precision of the Intersection over Union. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph neural network (GNN)-based models have been extensively studied for recommendations, as they can extract high-order collaborative signals accurately which is required for high-quality recommender systems.However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating.In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback.To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations.Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process.The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/NFARec.</p>

                  <p>Occlusion presents a significant challenge for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving.Collaborative perception has recently attracted a large research interest thanks to the ability to enhance the perception of autonomous vehicles via deep information fusion with intelligent roadside units (RSU), thus minimizing the impact of occlusion.While significant advancement has been made, the data-hungry nature of these methods creates a major hurdle for their real-world deployment, particularly due to the need for annotated RSU data.Manually annotating the vast amount of RSU data required for training is prohibitively expensive, given the sheer number of intersections and the effort involved in annotating point clouds.We address this challenge by devising a label-efficient object detection method for RSU based on unsupervised object discovery.Our paper introduces two new modules: one for object discovery based on a spatial-temporal aggregation of point clouds, and another for refinement.Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on a small portion of annotated data allows our object discovery models to narrow the performance gap with, or even surpass, fully supervised models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are carried out in simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent research has shown that incorporating bug-related facts, such as stack traces and GitHub issues, into prompts enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs?To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark.Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial.Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM's performance on a given task instance.We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair.Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt.This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set.To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked Maniple against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods.On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, Maniple repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple clients without raw data exposure.However, recent studies have shown that clients' private training data can be reconstructed from the gradients they share in FL, known as gradient inversion attacks (GIAs).While GIAs have demonstrated effectiveness under \emph{ideal settings and auxiliary assumptions}, their actual efficacy against \emph{practical FL systems} remains under-explored.To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study on GIAs in this work.We start with a survey of GIAs that establishes a milestone to trace their evolution and develops a systematization to uncover their inherent threats.Specifically, we categorize the auxiliary assumptions used by existing GIAs based on their practical accessibility to potential adversaries.To facilitate deeper analysis, we highlight the challenges that GIAs face in practical FL systems from three perspectives: \textit{local training}, \textit{model}, and \textit{post-processing}.We then perform extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations of state-of-the-art GIAs across diverse settings, utilizing eight datasets and thirteen models.Our findings indicate that GIAs have inherent limitations when reconstructing data under practical local training settings.Furthermore, their efficacy is sensitive to the trained model, and even simple post-processing measures applied to gradients can be effective defenses.Overall, our work provides crucial insights into the limited effectiveness of GIAs in practical FL systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By rectifying prior misconceptions, we hope to inspire more accurate and realistic investigations on this topic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the concept of Industries 5.0 develops, industrial metaverses are expected to operate in parallel with the actual industrial processes to offer ``Human-Centric" Safe, Secure, Sustainable, Sensitive, Service, and Smartness ``6S" manufacturing solutions.Industrial metaverses not only visualize the process of productivity in a dynamic and evolutional way, but also provide an immersive laboratory experimental environment for optimizing and remodeling the process.Besides, the customized user needs that are hidden in social media data can be discovered by social computing technologies, which introduces an input channel for building the whole social manufacturing process including industrial metaverses.This makes the fusion of multi-source data cross Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) the foundational and key challenge.This work firstly proposes a multi-source-data-fusion-driven operational architecture for industrial metaverses on the basis of conducting a comprehensive literature review on the state-of-the-art multi-source data fusion methods.The advantages and disadvantages of each type of method are analyzed by considering the fusion mechanisms and application scenarios.Especially, we combine the strengths of deep learning and knowledge graphs in scalability and parallel computation to enable our proposed framework the ability of prescriptive optimization and evolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This integration can address the shortcomings of deep learning in terms of explainability and fact fabrication, as well as overcoming the incompleteness and the challenges of construction and maintenance inherent in knowledge graphs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated through a parallel weaving case study.In the end, we discuss the challenges and future directions of multi-source data fusion cross CPSS for industrial metaverses and social manufacturing in Industries 5.0.</p>

                  <p>A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA).In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems.The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy.This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills.With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty.Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems.Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.</p>

                  <p>In some situations, the interpretability of the machine learning models plays a role as important as the model accuracy.Interpretability comes from the need to trust the prediction model, verify some of its properties, or even enforce them to improve fairness.Many model-agnostic explanatory methods exists to provide explanations for black-box models.In the regression task, the practitioner can use white-boxes or gray-boxes models to achieve more interpretable results, which is the case of symbolic regression.When using an explanatory method, and since interpretability lacks a rigorous definition, there is a need to evaluate and compare the quality and different explainers.This paper proposes a benchmark scheme to evaluate explanatory methods to explain regression models, mainly symbolic regression models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments were performed using 100 physics equations with different interpretable and non-interpretable regression methods and popular explanation methods, evaluating the performance of the explainers performance with several explanation measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.593</span></span>In addition, we further analyzed four benchmarks from the GP community.The results have shown that Symbolic Regression models can be an interesting alternative to white-box and black-box models that is capable of returning accurate models with appropriate explanations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Regarding the explainers, we observed that Partial Effects and SHAP were the most robust explanation models, with Integrated Gradients being unstable only with tree-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>This benchmark is publicly available for further experiments.</p>

                  <p>Over the last year, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become widely available and have exhibited fairness issues similar to those in previous machine learning systems.Current research is primarily focused on analyzing and quantifying these biases in training data and their impact on the decisions of these models, alongside developing mitigation strategies.This research largely targets well-known biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and language.However, it is clear that LLMs are also affected by other, less obvious implicit biases.The complex and often opaque nature of these models makes detecting such biases challenging, yet this is crucial due to their potential negative impact in various applications.In this paper, we explore new avenues for detecting these unanticipated biases in LLMs, focusing specifically on Uncertainty Quantification and Explainable AI methods.These approaches aim to assess the certainty of model decisions and to make the internal decision-making processes of LLMs more transparent, thereby identifying and understanding biases that are not immediately apparent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through this research, we aim to contribute to the development of fairer and more transparent AI systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span></p>

                  <p>Supply chain networks in enterprises are typically composed of complex topological graphs involving various types of nodes and edges, accommodating numerous products with considerable demand and supply variability.However, as supply chain networks expand in size and complexity, traditional supply chain planning methods (e.g., those found in heuristic rule-based and operations research-based systems) tend to become locally optimal or lack computational scalability, resulting in substantial imbalances between supply and demand across nodes in the network.This paper introduces a novel Generative AI technique, which we call Generative Probabilistic Planning (GPP).GPP generates dynamic supply action plans that are globally optimized across all network nodes over the time horizon for changing objectives like maximizing profits or service levels, factoring in time-varying probabilistic demand, lead time, and production conditions.GPP leverages attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), offline deep reinforcement learning (Offline RL), and policy simulations to train generative policy models and create optimal plans through probabilistic simulations, effectively accounting for various uncertainties.Our experiments using historical data from a global consumer goods company with complex supply chain networks demonstrate that GPP accomplishes objective-adaptable, probabilistically resilient, and dynamic planning for supply chain networks, leading to significant improvements in performance and profitability for enterprises.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work plays a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of AI adoption within the supply chain domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.588</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a versatile NeRF-based simulator for testing autonomous driving (AD) software systems, designed with a focus on sensor-realistic closed-loop evaluation and the creation of safety-critical scenarios.The simulator learns from sequences of real-world driving sensor data and enables reconfigurations and renderings of new, unseen scenarios.In this work, we use our simulator to test the responses of AD models to safety-critical scenarios inspired by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).Our evaluation reveals that, while state-of-the-art end-to-end planners excel in nominal driving scenarios in an open-loop setting, they exhibit critical flaws when navigating our safety-critical scenarios in a closed-loop setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This highlights the need for advancements in the safety and real-world usability of end-to-end planners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>By publicly releasing our simulator and scenarios as an easy-to-run evaluation suite, we invite the research community to explore, refine, and validate their AD models in controlled, yet highly configurable and challenging sensor-realistic environments.Code and instructions can be found at https://github.com/wljungbergh/NeuroNCAP</p>

                  <p>We study online selection problems in both the prophet and secretary settings, when arriving agents have interdependent values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the interdependent values model, introduced in the seminal work of Milgrom and Weber [1982], each agent has a private signal and the value of an agent is a function of the signals held by all agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Results in online selection crucially rely on some degree of independence of values, which is conceptually at odds with the interdependent values model.For prophet and secretary models under the standard independent values assumption, prior works provide constant factor approximations to the welfare.On the other hand, when agents have interdependent values, prior works in Economics and Computer Science provide truthful mechanisms that obtain optimal and approximately optimal welfare under certain assumptions on the valuation functions.   We bring together these two important lines of work and provide the first constant factor approximations for prophet and secretary problems with interdependent values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We consider both the algorithmic setting, where agents are non-strategic (but have interdependent values), and the mechanism design setting with strategic agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>All our results are constructive and use simple stopping rules.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in various research domains.This article examines their potential through a literature review and firsthand experimentation.While LLMs offer benefits like cost-effectiveness and efficiency, challenges such as prompt tuning, biases, and subjectivity must be addressed.The study presents insights from experiments utilizing LLMs for qualitative analysis, highlighting successes and limitations.Additionally, it discusses strategies for mitigating challenges, such as prompt optimization techniques and leveraging human expertise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study aligns with the 'LLMs as Research Tools' workshop's focus on integrating LLMs into HCI data work critically and ethically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>By addressing both opportunities and challenges, our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on their responsible application in research.</p>
