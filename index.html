                  <p>Dexterous robotic manipulation remains a challenging domain due to its strict demands for precision and robustness on both hardware and software.While dexterous robotic hands have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks, efficiently learning adaptive control policies for hands still presents a significant hurdle given the high dimensionalities of hands and tasks.To bridge this gap, we propose Tilde, an imitation learning-based in-hand manipulation system on a dexterous DeltaHand.It leverages 1) a low-cost, configurable, simple-to-control, soft dexterous robotic hand, DeltaHand, 2) a user-friendly, precise, real-time teleoperation interface, TeleHand, and 3) an efficient and generalizable imitation learning approach with diffusion policies.Our proposed TeleHand has a kinematic twin design to the DeltaHand that enables precise one-to-one joint control of the DeltaHand during teleoperation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This facilitates efficient high-quality data collection of human demonstrations in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we demonstrate the fully autonomous closed-loop deployment of diffusion policies learned from demonstrations across seven dexterous manipulation tasks with an average 90% success rate.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs), VLM-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) seeks to describe image quality linguistically to align with human expression and capture the multifaceted nature of IQA tasks.However, current methods are still far from practical usage.First, prior works focus narrowly on specific sub-tasks or settings, which do not align with diverse real-world applications.Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality.To overcome these challenges, we introduce Depicted image Quality Assessment in the Wild (DepictQA-Wild).Our method includes a multi-functional IQA task paradigm that encompasses both assessment and comparison tasks, brief and detailed responses, full-reference and non-reference scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a ground-truth-informed dataset construction approach to enhance data quality, and scale up the dataset to 495K under the brief-detail joint framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, we construct a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset, named DQ-495K.

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made great strides in recent years to achieve unprecedented performance across different tasks.However, due to commercial interest, the most competitive models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude have been gated behind proprietary interfaces without disclosing the training details.Recently, many institutions have open-sourced several strong LLMs like LLaMA-3, comparable to existing closed-source LLMs.However, only the model's weights are provided with most details (e.g., intermediate checkpoints, pre-training corpus, and training code, etc.)being undisclosed.To improve the transparency of LLMs, the research community has formed to open-source truly open LLMs (e.g., Pythia, Amber, OLMo), where more details (e.g., pre-training corpus and training code) are being provided.These models have greatly advanced the scientific study of these large models including their strengths, weaknesses, biases and risks.However, we observe that the existing truly open LLMs on reasoning, knowledge, and coding tasks are still inferior to existing state-of-the-art LLMs with similar model sizes.To this end, we open-source MAP-Neo, a highly capable and transparent bilingual language model with 7B parameters trained from scratch on 4.5T high-quality tokens.Our MAP-Neo is the first fully open-sourced bilingual LLM with comparable performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we open-source all details to reproduce our MAP-Neo, where the cleaned pre-training corpus, data cleaning pipeline, checkpoints, and well-optimized training/evaluation framework are provided. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Finally, we hope our MAP-Neo will enhance and strengthen the open research community and inspire more innovations and creativities to facilitate the further improvements of LLMs.</p>

To handle the challenging dialogue state tracking (DST) subtask, we break it down to simpler steps that are more compatible with in-context learning where only a handful of few-shot examples are used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test our approach on the multilingual TOD dataset X-RiSAWOZ, which has 12 domains in Chinese, English, French, Korean, Hindi, and code-mixed Hindi-English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>Our turn-by-turn DST accuracy on the 6 languages range from 55.6% to 80.3%, seemingly worse than the SOTA results from fine-tuned models that achieve from 60.7% to 82.8%; our BLEU scores in the response generation (RG) subtask are also significantly lower than SOTA.   However, after manual evaluation of the validation set, we find that by correcting gold label errors and improving dataset annotation schema, GPT-4 with our prompts can achieve (1) 89.6%-96.8% accuracy in DST, and (2) more than 99% correct response generation across different languages.This leads us to conclude that current automatic metrics heavily underestimate the effectiveness of in-context learning.</p>

                  <p>With the development of modern society, traffic volume continues to increase in most countries worldwide, leading to an increase in the rate of pavement damage Therefore, the real-time and highly accurate pavement damage detection and maintenance have become the current need.In this paper, an enhanced pavement damage detection method with CycleGAN and improved YOLOv5 algorithm is presented.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We selected 7644 self-collected images of pavement damage samples as the initial dataset and augmented it by CycleGAN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Due to a substantial difference between the images generated by CycleGAN and real road images, we proposed a data enhancement method based on an improved Scharr filter, CycleGAN, and Laplacian pyramid.To improve the target recognition effect on a complex background and solve the problem that the spatial pyramid pooling-fast module in the YOLOv5 network cannot handle multiscale targets, we introduced the convolutional block attention module attention mechanism and proposed the atrous spatial pyramid pooling with squeeze-and-excitation structure.In addition, we optimized the loss function of YOLOv5 by replacing the CIoU with EIoU.The experimental results showed that our algorithm achieved a precision of 0.872, recall of 0.854, and mean average precision@0.5 of 0.882 in detecting three main types of pavement damage: cracks, potholes, and patching.On the GPU, its frames per second reached 68, meeting the requirements for real-time detection.Its overall performance even exceeded the current more advanced YOLOv7 and achieved good results in practical applications, providing a basis for decision-making in pavement damage detection and prevention.</p>

                  <p>Image matting aims to obtain an alpha matte that separates foreground objects from the background accurately.Recently, trimap-free matting has been well studied because it requires only the original image without any extra input.Such methods usually extract a rough foreground by itself to take place trimap as further guidance.However, the definition of 'foreground' lacks a unified standard and thus ambiguities arise.Besides, the extracted foreground is sometimes incomplete due to inadequate network design.Most importantly, there is not a large-scale real-world matting dataset, and current trimap-free methods trained with synthetic images suffer from large domain shift problems in practice.In this paper, we define the salient object as foreground, which is consistent with human cognition and annotations of the current matting dataset.Meanwhile, data and technologies in salient object detection can be transferred to matting in a breeze.To obtain a more accurate and complete alpha matte, we propose a network called \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{F}eature fusion-based \textbf{C}oarse-to-fine Network \textbf{(MFC-Net)}, which fully integrates multiple features for an accurate and complete alpha matte.Furthermore, we introduce image harmony in data composition to bridge the gap between synthetic and real images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, we establish the largest general matting dataset \textbf{(Real-19k)} in the real world to date. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span>Experiments show that our method is significantly effective on both synthetic and real-world images, and the performance in the real-world dataset is far better than existing matting-free methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although humans inherently have diverse values, current large language model (LLM) alignment methods often assume that aligning LLMs with the general public's preferences is optimal.A major challenge in adopting a more individualized approach to LLM alignment is its lack of scalability, as it involves repeatedly acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each individual's preferences.To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm where users specify what they value most within the system message, steering the LLM's generation behavior to better align with the user's intentions.However, a naive application of such an approach is non-trivial since LLMs are typically trained on a uniform system message (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant") which limits their ability to generalize to diverse, unseen system messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve this generalization, we create the Multifaceted Collection, a preference dataset with 192k combinations of values beyond generic helpfulness and harmlessness, spanning 65k user instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>Using this dataset, we train a 7B LLM called Janus and test it on 921 prompts from 5 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, FLASK, Koala, MT-Bench, and Self-Instruct) by adding various unseen system messages that reflect user preferences.Janus achieves tie+win rate of 75.2%, 72.4%, and 66.4% against Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, respectively.Unexpectedly, on three benchmarks focused on response helpfulness (AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, Arena Hard Auto v0.1), Janus also outperforms LLaMA 3 8B Instruct by a +4.0%, +0.1%, +3.0% margin, underscoring that training with a vast array of system messages could also enhance alignment to the general public's preference as well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, dataset, benchmark, and models are available at https://github.com/kaistAI/Janus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems can autonomously monitor and identify disturbances, reducing the need for manual labor and associated costs.However, current VAD systems are often limited by their superficial semantic understanding of scenes and minimal user interaction.Additionally, the prevalent data scarcity in existing datasets restricts their applicability in open-world scenarios.In this paper, we introduce Hawk, a novel framework that leverages interactive large Visual Language Models (VLM) to interpret video anomalies precisely.Recognizing the difference in motion information between abnormal and normal videos, Hawk explicitly integrates motion modality to enhance anomaly identification.To reinforce motion attention, we construct an auxiliary consistency loss within the motion and video space, guiding the video branch to focus on the motion modality.Moreover, to improve the interpretation of motion-to-language, we establish a clear supervisory relationship between motion and its linguistic representation.Furthermore, we have annotated over 8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions, enabling effective training across diverse open-world scenarios, and also created 8,000 question-answering pairs for users' open-world questions.The final results demonstrate that Hawk achieves SOTA performance, surpassing existing baselines in both video description generation and question-answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our codes/dataset/demo will be released at https://github.com/jqtangust/hawk. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.923</span></span></p>

                  <p>The surge in demand for cost-effective, durable long-term archival media, coupled with density limitations of contemporary magnetic media, has resulted in synthetic DNA emerging as a promising new alternative.Despite its benefits, storing data on DNA poses several challenges as the technology used for reading/writing data and achieving random access on DNA are highly error prone.In order to deal with such errors, it is important to design efficient pipelines that can carefully use redundancy to mask errors without amplifying overall cost.In this work, we present Columnar MOlecular Storage System (CMOSS), a novel, end-to-end DNA storage pipeline that can provide error-tolerant data storage at low read/write costs.CMOSS differs from SOTA on three fronts (i) a motif-based, vertical layout in contrast to nucleotide-based horizontal layout used by SOTA, (ii) merged consensus calling and decoding enabled by the vertical layout, and (iii) a flexible, fixed-size, block-based data organization for random access over DNA storage in contrast to the variable-sized, object-based access used by SOTA.Using an in-depth evaluation via simulation studies and real wet-lab experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of various CMOSS design choices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make the entire pipeline together with the read datasets openly available to the community for faithful reproduction and furthering research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena.As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where we assume binary effects that are recorded as high-dimensional images in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).Despite being the simplest possible setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates.To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming.Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof.We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model.Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones.Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autoformalization involves automatically translating informal math into formal theorems and proofs that are machine-verifiable.Euclidean geometry provides an interesting and controllable domain for studying autoformalization.In this paper, we introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for autoformalizing Euclidean geometry, which combines domain knowledge, SMT solvers, and large language models (LLMs).One challenge in Euclidean geometry is that informal proofs rely on diagrams, leaving gaps in texts that are hard to formalize.To address this issue, we use theorem provers to fill in such diagrammatic information automatically, so that the LLM only needs to autoformalize the explicit textual steps, making it easier for the model.We also provide automatic semantic evaluation for autoformalized theorem statements.We construct LeanEuclid, an autoformalization benchmark consisting of problems from Euclid's Elements and the UniGeo dataset formalized in the Lean proof assistant.Experiments with GPT-4 and GPT-4V show the capability and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on autoformalizing geometry problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code are available at https://github.com/loganrjmurphy/LeanEuclid. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-world long-tailed semi-supervised learning (OLSSL) has increasingly attracted attention.However, existing OLSSL algorithms generally assume that the distributions between known and novel categories are nearly identical.Against this backdrop, we construct a more \emph{Realistic Open-world Long-tailed Semi-supervised Learning} (\textbf{ROLSSL}) setting where there is no premise on the distribution relationships between known and novel categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, even within the known categories, the number of labeled samples is significantly smaller than that of the unlabeled samples, as acquiring valid annotations is often prohibitively costly in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Under the proposed ROLSSL setting, we propose a simple yet potentially effective solution called dual-stage post-hoc logit adjustments.The proposed approach revisits the logit adjustment strategy by considering the relationships among the frequency of samples, the total number of categories, and the overall size of data.Then, it estimates the distribution of unlabeled data for both known and novel categories to dynamically readjust the corresponding predictive probabilities, effectively mitigating category bias during the learning of known and novel classes with more selective utilization of imbalanced unlabeled data.Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 have demonstrated performance improvements of up to 50.1\%, validating the superiority of our proposed method and establishing a strong baseline for this task.For further researches, the anonymous link to the experimental code is at \href{https://github.com/heyuanpengpku/ROLSSL}{\textcolor{brightpink}{https://github.com/heyuanpengpku/ROLSSL}}</p>

                  <p>A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate.Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set.Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30.Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set.In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias.Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets.Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs), VLM-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) seeks to describe image quality linguistically to align with human expression and capture the multifaceted nature of IQA tasks.However, current methods are still far from practical usage.First, prior works focus narrowly on specific sub-tasks or settings, which do not align with diverse real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we introduce Depicted image Quality Assessment in the Wild (DepictQA-Wild).Our method includes a multi-functional IQA task paradigm that encompasses both assessment and comparison tasks, brief and detailed responses, full-reference and non-reference scenarios.We introduce a ground-truth-informed dataset construction approach to enhance data quality, and scale up the dataset to 495K under the brief-detail joint framework.Consequently, we construct a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset, named DQ-495K. We also retain image resolution during training to better handle resolution-related quality issues, and estimate a confidence score that is helpful to filter out low-quality responses.Experimental results demonstrate that DepictQA-Wild significantly outperforms traditional score-based methods, prior VLM-based IQA models, and proprietary GPT-4V in distortion identification, instant rating, and reasoning tasks.Our advantages are further confirmed by real-world applications including assessing the web-downloaded images and ranking model-processed images.Datasets and codes will be released in https://depictqa.github.io/depictqa-wild/.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly Detection focuses on identifying samples that deviate from the norm.When working with high-dimensional data such as images, a crucial requirement for detecting anomalous patterns is learning lower-dimensional representations that capture normal concepts seen during training.Recent advances in self-supervised learning have shown great promise in this regard.However, many of the most successful self-supervised anomaly detection methods assume prior knowledge about the structure of anomalies and leverage synthetic anomalies during training.Yet, in many real-world applications, we do not know what to expect from unseen data, and we can solely leverage knowledge about normal data.In this work, we propose Con2, which addresses this problem by setting normal training data into distinct contexts while preserving its normal properties, letting us observe the data from different perspectives.Unseen normal data consequently adheres to learned context representations while anomalies fail to do so, letting us detect them without any knowledge about anomalies during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while exhibiting superior performance in a more realistic healthcare setting, where knowledge about potential anomalies is often scarce. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>Network Signalling Data (NSD) have the potential to provide continuous spatio-temporal information about the presence, mobility, and usage patterns of cell phone services by individuals.Such information is invaluable for monitoring large urban areas and supporting the implementation of decision-making services.When analyzed in real time, NSD can enable the early detection of critical urban events, including fires, large accidents, stampedes, terrorist attacks, and sports and leisure gatherings, especially if these events significantly impact mobile phone network activity in the affected areas.This paper presents empirical evidence that advanced NSD can detect anomalies in mobile traffic service consumption, attributable to critical urban events, with fine spatial and temporal resolutions.We introduce two methodologies for real-time anomaly detection from multivariate time series extracted from large-scale NSD, utilizing a range of algorithms adapted from the state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection.Our research includes a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of these algorithms on a large-scale dataset of NSD service consumption for the Paris region.The evaluation uses an original dataset of documented critical or unusual urban events.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset has been built as a ground truth basis for assessing the algorithms performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The obtained results demonstrate that our framework can detect unusual events almost instantaneously and locate the affected areas with high precision, largely outperforming random classifiers.This efficiency and effectiveness underline the potential of NSD-based anomaly detection in significantly enhancing emergency response strategies and urban planning.</p>

                  <p>Collaborative edge computing has become a popular paradigm where edge devices collaborate by sharing resources.Data dissemination is a fundamental problem in CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how.Existing works on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which involves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network links.Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective.The existing works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a non-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the multi-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT).Furthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot be ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices.This work formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which includes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to minimize the sum of CCT.This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as each flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links.We propose a source and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides an initial solution considering the coflow characteristics.SCASA further improves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by leveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to 83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach that keeps data localized and often incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to enhance privacy guarantees.Similar to previous work on DP in ML, we observed that differentially private federated learning (DPFL) introduces performance disparities, particularly affecting minority groups.Recent work has attempted to address performance fairness in vanilla FL through clustering, but this method remains sensitive and prone to errors, which are further exacerbated by the DP noise in DPFL.To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel clustered DPFL algorithm designed to effectively identify clients' clusters in highly heterogeneous settings while maintaining high accuracy with DP guarantees.To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their model updates and training loss values.Our proposed approach also addresses the server's uncertainties in clustering clients' model updates by employing larger batch sizes along with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to alleviate the impact of noise and potential clustering errors, especially in privacy-sensitive scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We also extensively evaluate our approach across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets and show its effectiveness in mitigating the disparate impact of DP in FL settings with a small computational cost.</p>

                  <p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models.State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model.Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality.In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well.Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to (explicitly or implicitly) build an reward model, while learning the policy model.This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but also promote the ability to distinguish between the preferred and non-preferred continuations.Moreover, we identify a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and certain self-play approach proposed recently, and showed that self-play is a special case of modeling a reward-learning agent.Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem.Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Our results indicate that it is beneficial to explicitly or implicitly leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</p>

                  <p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) identifies sentiment information related to specific aspects and provides deeper market insights to businesses and organizations.With the emergence of large language models (LMs), recent studies have proposed using fixed examples for instruction tuning to reformulate ABSA as a generation task.However, the performance is sensitive to the selection of in-context examples; several retrieval methods are based on surface similarity and are independent of the LM generative objective.This study proposes an instruction learning method with retrieval-based example ranking for ABSA tasks.For each target sample, an LM was applied as a scorer to estimate the likelihood of the output given the input and a candidate example as the prompt, and training examples were labeled as positive or negative by ranking the scores.An alternating training schema is proposed to train both the retriever and LM.Instructional prompts can be constructed using high-quality examples.The LM is used for both scoring and inference, improving the generation efficiency without incurring additional computational costs or training difficulties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three ABSA subtasks verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over various strong baseline models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Code and data are released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IT-RER-ABSA-181F.</p>

                  <p>The goal of Fair Representation Learning (FRL) is to mitigate biases in machine learning models by learning data representations that enable high accuracy on downstream tasks while minimizing discrimination based on sensitive attributes.The evaluation of FRL methods in many recent works primarily focuses on the tradeoff between downstream fairness and accuracy with respect to a single task that was used to approximate the utility of representations during training (proxy task).This incentivizes retaining only features relevant to the proxy task while discarding all other information.In extreme cases, this can cause the learned representations to collapse to a trivial, binary value, rendering them unusable in transfer settings.In this work, we argue that this approach is fundamentally mismatched with the original motivation of FRL, which arises from settings with many downstream tasks unknown at training time (transfer tasks).To remedy this, we propose to refocus the evaluation protocol of FRL methods primarily around the performance on transfer tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A key challenge when conducting such an evaluation is the lack of adequate benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>We address this by formulating four criteria that a suitable evaluation procedure should fulfill.Based on these, we propose TransFair, a benchmark that satisfies these criteria, consisting of novel variations of popular FRL datasets with carefully calibrated transfer tasks.In this setting, we reevaluate state-of-the-art FRL methods, observing that they often overfit to the proxy task, which causes them to underperform on certain transfer tasks.We further highlight the importance of task-agnostic learning signals for FRL methods, as they can lead to more transferrable representations.</p>

                  <p>Wiki articles are created and maintained by a crowd of editors, producing a continuous stream of reviews.Reviews can take the form of additions, reverts, or both.This crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation since neither reviews nor editors are automatically screened and purged.To protect articles against vandalism or damage, the stream of reviews can be mined to classify reviews and profile editors in real-time.The goal of this work is to anticipate and explain which reviews to revert.This way, editors are informed why their edits will be reverted.The proposed method employs stream-based processing, updating the profiling and classification models on each incoming event.The profiling uses side and content-based features employing Natural Language Processing, and editor profiles are incrementally updated based on their reviews.Since the proposed method relies on self-explainable classification algorithms, it is possible to understand why a review has been classified as a revert or a non-revert.In addition, this work contributes an algorithm for generating synthetic data for class balancing, making the final classification fairer.The proposed online method was tested with a real data set from Wikivoyage, which was balanced through the aforementioned synthetic data generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results attained near-90 % values for all evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span></p>

                  <p>A wide range of (multivariate) temporal (1D) and spatial (2D) data analysis tasks, such as grouping vehicle sensor trajectories, can be formulated as clustering with given metric constraints.Existing metric-constrained clustering algorithms overlook the rich correlation between feature similarity and metric distance, i.e., metric autocorrelation.The model-based variations of these clustering algorithms (e.g. TICC and STICC) achieve SOTA performance, yet suffer from computational instability and complexity by using a metric-constrained Expectation-Maximization procedure.In order to address these two problems, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, MC-GTA (Model-based Clustering via Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations).Its objective is only composed of pairwise weighted sums of feature similarity terms (square Wasserstein-2 distance) and metric autocorrelation terms (a novel multivariate generalization of classic semivariogram).We show that MC-GTA is effectively minimizing the total hinge loss for intra-cluster observation pairs not passing goodness-of-fit tests, i.e., statistically not originating from the same distribution.Experiments on 1D/2D synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MC-GTA successfully incorporates metric autocorrelation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms strong baselines by large margins (up to 14.3% in ARI and 32.1% in NMI) with faster and stabler optimization (>10x speedup). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing heterogeneous graph neural network algorithms (HGNNs) mostly rely on meta-paths to capture the rich semantic information contained in heterogeneous graphs (also known as heterogeneous information networks (HINs)), but most of these HGNNs focus on different ways of feature aggre gation and ignore the properties of the meta-paths themselves.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper studies meta-paths in three commonly used data sets and finds that there are huge differences in the number of neighbors connected by different meta paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>At the same time, the noise information contained in large neigh bor paths will have an adverse impact on model performance.Therefore, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Classification and Aggregation Algorithm Based on Large and Small Neighbor Path Iden tification(LSPI).LSPI firstly divides the meta-paths into large and small neighbor paths through the path discriminator , and in order to reduce the noise interference problem in large neighbor paths, LSPI selects neighbor nodes with higher similarity from both topology and feature perspectives, and passes small neighbor paths and filtered large neighbor paths through different graph convolution components.Aggregation is performed to obtain feature information under different subgraphs, and then LSPI uses subgraph level attention to fuse the feature information under different subgraphs to generate the final node embedding.Finally this paper verifies the superiority of the method through extensive experiments and also gives suggestions on the number of nodes to be retained in large neighbor paths through exper iments.The complete reproducible code adn data has been published at: https://github.com/liuhua811/LSPIA.</p>

                  <p>The rapid growth of neural network models shared on the internet has made model weights an important data modality.However, this information is underutilized as the weights are uninterpretable, and publicly available models are disorganized.Inspired by Darwin's tree of life, we define the Model Tree which describes the origin of models i.e., the parent model that was used to fine-tune the target model.Similarly to the natural world, the tree structure is unknown.In this paper, we introduce the task of Model Tree Heritage Recovery (MoTHer Recovery) for discovering Model Trees in the ever-growing universe of neural networks.Our hypothesis is that model weights encode this information, the challenge is to decode the underlying tree structure given the weights.Beyond the immediate application of model authorship attribution, MoTHer recovery holds exciting long-term applications akin to indexing the internet by search engines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Practically, for each pair of models, this task requires: i) determining if they are related, and ii) establishing the direction of the relationship. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>We find that certain distributional properties of the weights evolve monotonically during training, which enables us to classify the relationship between two given models.MoTHer recovery reconstructs entire model hierarchies, represented by a directed tree, where a parent model gives rise to multiple child models through additional training.Our approach successfully reconstructs complex Model Trees, as well as the structure of "in-the-wild" model families such as Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion.</p>

                  <p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function.The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP.Foster et al.[2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution.However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space.The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al.[2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs.The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states.The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions.The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p>

                  <p>Autoregressively trained transformers have brought a profound revolution to the world, especially with their in-context learning (ICL) ability to address downstream tasks.Recently, several studies suggest that transformers learn a mesa-optimizer during autoregressive (AR) pretraining to implement ICL.Namely, the forward pass of the trained transformer is equivalent to optimizing an inner objective function in-context.However, whether the practical non-convex training dynamics will converge to the ideal mesa-optimizer is still unclear.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Towards filling this gap, we investigate the non-convex dynamics of a one-layer linear causal self-attention model autoregressively trained by gradient flow, where the sequences are generated by an AR process $x_{t+1} = W x_t$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>First, under a certain condition of data distribution, we prove that an autoregressively trained transformer learns $W$ by implementing one step of gradient descent to minimize an ordinary least squares (OLS) problem in-context.It then applies the learned $\widehat{W}$ for next-token prediction, thereby verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis.Next, under the same data conditions, we explore the capability limitations of the obtained mesa-optimizer.We show that a stronger assumption related to the moments of data is the sufficient and necessary condition that the learned mesa-optimizer recovers the distribution.Besides, we conduct exploratory analyses beyond the first data condition and prove that generally, the trained transformer will not perform vanilla gradient descent for the OLS problem.Finally, our simulation results verify the theoretical results.</p>

                  <p>UAV tracking and pose estimation plays an imperative role in various UAV-related missions, such as formation control and anti-UAV measures.Accurately detecting and tracking UAVs in a 3D space remains a particularly challenging problem, as it requires extracting sparse features of micro UAVs from different flight environments and continuously matching correspondences, especially during agile flight.Generally, cameras and LiDARs are the two main types of sensors used to capture UAV trajectories in flight.However, both sensors have limitations in UAV classification and pose estimation.This technical report briefly introduces the method proposed by our team "NTU-ICG" for the CVPR 2024 UG2+ Challenge Track 5.This work develops a clustering-based learning detection approach, CL-Det, for UAV tracking and pose estimation using two types of LiDARs, namely Livox Avia and LiDAR 360.We combine the information from the two data sources to locate drones in 3D.We first align the timestamps of Livox Avia data and LiDAR 360 data and then separate the point cloud of objects of interest (OOIs) from the environment.The point cloud of OOIs is clustered using the DBSCAN method, with the midpoint of the largest cluster assumed to be the UAV position.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we utilize historical estimations to fill in missing data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>The proposed method shows competitive pose estimation performance and ranks 5th on the final leaderboard of the CVPR 2024 UG2+ Challenge.</p>

We present SOLD, a novel principled method to learn this subspace from short offline trajectories with guarantees.We then provide two methods to leverage this subspace online: LOCAL-UCB and ProBALL-UCB.We demonstrate that LOCAL-UCB enjoys $\tilde O(\min(d_A\sqrt{T}, d_K\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, where the effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is larger.ProBALL-UCB enjoys a slightly weaker guarantee, but is more practical and computationally efficient.Finally, we establish the efficacy of our methods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie recommendation data from MovieLens.</p>

                  <p>While deep networks have achieved broad success in analyzing natural images, when applied to medical scans, they often fail in unexcepted situations.We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images.A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings.Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept.We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets.In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average.Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.</p>

                  <p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable.In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability.Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage.Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting.These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations.They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces \emph{VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction)}, a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks.We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments.In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.</p>

We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms.In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem.For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.</p>

                  <p>The growing need for sustainable energy solutions has driven the integration of digitalized buildings into the power grid, utilizing Internet-of-Things technology to optimize building performance and energy efficiency.However, incorporating IoT point data within deep-learning frameworks for energy management presents a complex challenge, predominantly due to the inherent data heterogeneity.This paper comprehensively analyzes the multifaceted heterogeneity present in real-world building IoT data streams.We meticulously dissect the heterogeneity across multiple dimensions, encompassing ontology, etiology, temporal irregularity, spatial diversity, and their combined effects on the IoT point data distribution.In addition, experiments using state-of-the-art forecasting models are conducted to evaluate their impacts on the performance of deep-learning models for forecasting tasks.By charting the diversity along these dimensions, we illustrate the challenges and delineate pathways for future research to leverage this heterogeneity as a resource rather than a roadblock.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This exploration sets the stage for advancing the predictive abilities of deep-learning algorithms and catalyzing the evolution of intelligent energy-efficient buildings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

In this paper, we show that the 3D local processing in Pangu-Weather is computationally sub-optimal.We design ArchesWeather, a transformer model that combines 2D attention with a column-wise attention-based feature interaction module, and demonstrate that this design improves forecasting skill.   ArchesWeather is trained at 1.5{\deg} resolution and 24h lead time, with a training budget of a few GPU-days and a lower inference cost than competing methods.An ensemble of two of our best models shows competitive RMSE scores with the IFS HRES and outperforms the 1.4{\deg} 50-members NeuralGCM ensemble for one day ahead forecasting.

                  <p>Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima.To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis.Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data.We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network.Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework.Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness.Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.</p>

                  <p>Character animation in real-world scenarios necessitates a variety of constraints, such as trajectories, key-frames, interactions, etc.Existing methodologies typically treat single or a finite set of these constraint(s) as separate control tasks.They are often specialized, and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable.We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem.In response to the complexity of practical motion control, we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem.This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks.To address this, we introduce a new paradigm, programmable motion generation.In this paradigm, any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints.These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them.We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion.Consequently, the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the required constraints.Experiments show that we can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks.These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics, geometric constraints, physical laws, interactions with scenes, objects or the character own body parts, etc.All of these are achieved in a unified approach, without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs.During the programming of novel tasks, we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model.With the assistance of large language models, we also achieved automatic programming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope that this work will pave the way for the motion control of general AI agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.599</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the era of artificial intelligence, the diversity of data modalities and annotation formats often renders data unusable directly, requiring understanding and format conversion before it can be used by researchers or developers with different needs.To tackle this problem, this article introduces a framework called Dataset Description Language (DSDL) that aims to simplify dataset processing by providing a unified standard for AI datasets.DSDL adheres to the three basic practical principles of generic, portable, and extensible, using a unified standard to express data of different modalities and structures, facilitating the dissemination of AI data, and easily extending to new modalities and tasks.The standardized specifications of DSDL reduce the workload for users in data dissemination, processing, and usage.To further improve user convenience, we provide predefined DSDL templates for various tasks, convert mainstream datasets to comply with DSDL specifications, and provide comprehensive documentation and DSDL tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These efforts aim to simplify the use of AI data, thereby improving the efficiency of AI development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

We assess the feasibility of using smaller, open-weight models to replace GPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned regimes, assuming access to only a single, low-cost GPU.We assess value-sensitive issues around bias, privacy, and abstention on three additional tasks relevant to those topics.We find that with relatively low effort, very low absolute monetary cost, and relatively little data for fine-tuning, small open-weight models can achieve competitive performance in domain-adapted tasks without sacrificing generality.We then run experiments considering practical issues in bias, privacy, and hallucination risk, finding that open models offer several benefits over closed models.We intend this work as a case study in understanding the opportunity cost of reproducibility and transparency over for-profit state-of-the-art zero shot performance, finding this cost to be marginal under realistic settings.</p>

                  <p>Camera relocalization is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics.Recent advancements in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown promise in synthesizing photo-realistic images.Several works have utilized NeRFs for refining camera poses, but they do not account for lighting changes that can affect scene appearance and shadow regions, causing a degraded pose optimization process.In this paper, we propose a two-staged pipeline that normalizes images with varying lighting and shadow conditions to improve camera relocalization.We implement our scene representation upon a hash-encoded NeRF which significantly boosts up the pose optimization process.To account for the noisy image gradient computing problem in grid-based NeRFs, we further propose a re-devised truncated dynamic low-pass filter (TDLF) and a numerical gradient averaging technique to smoothen the process.Experimental results on several datasets with varying lighting conditions demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in camera relocalization under varying lighting conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span></p>
