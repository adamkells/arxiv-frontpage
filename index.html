Furthermore, our work has made significant contributions to mitigating real-world threats.We have reported 1,726 phishing addresses to the community, accounting for 42.7% of total community contributions during the same period.Additionally, we have sent 2,539 on-chain alert messages, assisting 1,980 victims.This research serves as a valuable reference in combating the emerging PTXPHISH and safeguarding users' assets.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), long-context information understanding and processing have become a hot topic in academia and industry.However, benchmarks for evaluating the ability of LLMs to handle long-context information do not seem to have kept pace with the development of LLMs.Despite the emergence of various long-context evaluation benchmarks, the types of capability assessed are still limited, without new capability dimensions.In this paper, we introduce DetectiveQA, a narrative reasoning benchmark featured with an average context length of over 100K tokens.DetectiveQA focuses on evaluating the long-context reasoning ability of LLMs, which not only requires a full understanding of context but also requires extracting important evidences from the context and reasoning according to extracted evidences to answer the given questions.This is a new dimension of capability evaluation, which is more in line with the current intelligence level of LLMs.We use detective novels as data sources, which naturally have various reasoning elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we manually annotated 600 questions in Chinese and then also provided an English edition of the context information and questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>We evaluate many long-context LLMs on DetectiveQA, including commercial and open-sourced models, and the results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process true long-context dependency questions.</p>

                  <p>Pediatric pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years worldwide, imposing a substantial burden on affected families.Currently, there are three significant hurdles in diagnosing and treating pediatric pneumonia.Firstly, pediatric pneumonia shares similar symptoms with other respiratory diseases, making rapid and accurate differential diagnosis challenging.Secondly, primary hospitals often lack sufficient medical resources and experienced doctors.Lastly, providing personalized diagnostic reports and treatment recommendations is labor-intensive and time-consuming.To tackle these challenges, we proposed a Medical Multimodal Large Language Model for Pediatric Pneumonia (P2Med-MLLM).It was capable of handling diverse clinical tasks, such as generating free-text radiology reports and medical records within a unified framework.Specifically, P2Med-MLLM can process both pure text and image-text data, trained on an extensive and large-scale dataset (P2Med-MD), including real clinical information from 163,999 outpatient and 8,684 inpatient cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset comprised 2D chest X-ray images, 3D chest CT images, corresponding radiology reports, and outpatient and inpatient records. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.887</span></span>We designed a three-stage training strategy to enable P2Med-MLLM to comprehend medical knowledge and follow instructions for various clinical tasks.To rigorously evaluate P2Med-MLLM's performance, we developed P2Med-MBench, a benchmark consisting of 642 meticulously verified samples by pediatric pulmonology specialists, covering six clinical decision-support tasks and a balanced variety of diseases.The automated scoring results demonstrated the superiority of P2Med-MLLM.This work plays a crucial role in assisting primary care doctors with prompt disease diagnosis and treatment planning, reducing severe symptom mortality rates, and optimizing the allocation of medical resources.</p>

Benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs with this dataset reveals varying degrees of success, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses in interpreting diverse types of visual data.The results provide valuable insights into the current capabilities of LLMs and identify key areas for improvement.This work establishes a foundational benchmark for future research and development aimed at enhancing the visual interpretative abilities of language models.In the future, improved LLMs with robust visual interpretation skills can significantly aid in automated data analysis, scientific research, educational tools, and business intelligence applications.</p>

                  <p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss, executive dysfunction, and personality changes.Early diagnosis is challenging due to subtle symptoms and varied presentations, often leading to misdiagnosis with traditional unimodal diagnostic methods due to their limited scope.This study introduces an advanced multimodal classification model that integrates clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and EEG data to enhance diagnostic accuracy.The model incorporates a feature tagger with a tabular data coding architecture and utilizes the TimesBlock module to capture intricate temporal patterns in Electroencephalograms (EEG) data.By employing Cross-modal Attention Aggregation module, the model effectively fuses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial information with EEG temporal data, significantly improving the distinction between AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Normal Cognition.Simultaneously, we have constructed the first AD classification dataset that includes three modalities: EEG, MRI, and tabular data.Our innovative approach aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, potentially slowing the progression of AD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and our private ADMC dataset are available at https://github.com/JustlfC03/MSTNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span></p>

                  <p>Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information.Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR.Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition.These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions.Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability.Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity.For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features.We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information.To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</p>

                  <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions.Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors.This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon that can even change the way users perceive this song.In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation.PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics.This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones.We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using both publicly available listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from Deezer, a global music streaming service, confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>ARINC 429 is a ubiquitous data bus for civil avionics, enabling reliable communication between devices from disparate manufacturers.However, ARINC 429 lacks any form of encryption or authentication, making it an inherently insecure communication protocol and rendering any connected avionics vulnerable to a range of attacks.We constructed a hardware-in-the-loop simulator with ARINC 429 buses, explored these vulnerabilities, and identified their potential to deny, degrade, or disrupt aircraft capabilities.We performed a denial-of-service attack against a multi-function display via a compromised ARINC 429 bus using commercially available tools, which succeeded in disabling important navigational aids.This proven attack on physical avionics illustrates the risk inherent in ARINC 429 and the need for the ability to detect these attacks.One potential mitigation is an intrusion detection system (IDS) trained on data collected from the electrical properties of the physical bus.Although previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of an IDS on an ARINC 429 bus, no IDS has been trained on data generated by avionics hardware.To facilitate this, we recorded voltage traces and message history generated by avionics and adversarial devices on the ARINC 429 bus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available collection of hardware-generated ARINC 429 signal data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation.Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area.Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering.However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views.In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did.We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span></p>

                  <p>Partially-supervised multi-organ medical image segmentation aims to develop a unified semantic segmentation model by utilizing multiple partially-labeled datasets, with each dataset providing labels for a single class of organs.However, the limited availability of labeled foreground organs and the absence of supervision to distinguish unlabeled foreground organs from the background pose a significant challenge, which leads to a distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled pixels.Although existing pseudo-labeling methods can be employed to learn from both labeled and unlabeled pixels, they are prone to performance degradation in this task, as they rely on the assumption that labeled and unlabeled pixels have the same distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, to address the problem of distribution mismatch, we propose a labeled-to-unlabeled distribution alignment (LTUDA) framework that aligns feature distributions and enhances discriminative capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Specifically, we introduce a cross-set data augmentation strategy, which performs region-level mixing between labeled and unlabeled organs to reduce distribution discrepancy and enrich the training set.Besides, we propose a prototype-based distribution alignment method that implicitly reduces intra-class variation and increases the separation between the unlabeled foreground and background.This can be achieved by encouraging consistency between the outputs of two prototype classifiers and a linear classifier.Extensive experimental results on the AbdomenCT-1K dataset and a union of four benchmark datasets (including LiTS, MSD-Spleen, KiTS, and NIH82) demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art partially-supervised methods by a considerable margin, and even surpasses the fully-supervised methods.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/xjiangmed/LTUDA.</p>

However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists.In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources.We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region.Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners.Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator.The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.Additional details along with the dataset links and codes are available at $\href{https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/cracks-crowdsourcing-resources-for-analysis-and-categorization-of-key-subsurface-faults/}{link}$.</p>

                  <p>Measuring 3D geometric structures of indoor scenes requires dedicated depth sensors, which are not always available.Echo-based depth estimation has recently been studied as a promising alternative solution.All previous studies have assumed the use of echoes in the audible range.However, one major problem is that audible echoes cannot be used in quiet spaces or other situations where producing audible sounds is prohibited.In this paper, we consider echo-based depth estimation using inaudible ultrasonic echoes.While ultrasonic waves provide high measurement accuracy in theory, the actual depth estimation accuracy when ultrasonic echoes are used has remained unclear, due to its disadvantage of being sensitive to noise and susceptible to attenuation.We first investigate the depth estimation accuracy when the frequency of the sound source is restricted to the high-frequency band, and found that the accuracy decreased when the frequency was limited to ultrasonic ranges.Based on this observation, we propose a novel deep learning method to improve the accuracy of ultrasonic echo-based depth estimation by using audible echoes as auxiliary data only during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results with a public dataset demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Most of existing studies on submodular maximization focus on selecting a subset of items that maximizes a \emph{single} submodular function.However, in many real-world scenarios, we might have multiple user-specific functions, each of which models the utility of a particular type of user.In these settings, our goal would be to choose a set of items that performs well across all the user-specific functions.One way to tackle this problem is to select a single subset that maximizes the sum of all of the user-specific functions.Although this aggregate approach is efficient in the sense that it avoids computation of sets for individual functions, it really misses the power of personalization - for it does not allow to choose different sets for different functions.In this paper, we introduce the problem of personalized submodular maximization with two candidate solutions.For any two candidate solutions, the utility of each user-specific function is defined as the better of these two candidates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our objective is, therefore, to select the best set of two candidates that maximize the sum of utilities of all the user-specific functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>We have designed effective algorithms for this problem.We also discuss how our approach generalizes to multiple candidate solutions, increasing flexibility and personalization in our solution.</p>

                  <p>Despite their high accuracy, complex neural networks demand significant computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems.Compression algorithms have been developed to address these challenges by reducing model size and computational demands while maintaining accuracy.Among these approaches, factorization methods based on tensor decomposition are theoretically sound and effective.However, they face difficulties in selecting the appropriate rank for decomposition.This paper tackles this issue by presenting a unified framework that simultaneously applies decomposition and optimal rank selection, employing a composite compression loss within defined rank constraints.Our approach includes an automatic rank search in a continuous space, efficiently identifying optimal rank configurations without the use of training data, making it computationally efficient.Combined with a subsequent fine-tuning step, our approach maintains the performance of highly compressed models on par with their original counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a comprehensive analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.895</span></span></p>

                  <p>In many real-world applications, the frequency distribution of class labels for training data can exhibit a long-tailed distribution, which challenges traditional approaches of training deep neural networks that require heavy amounts of balanced data.Gathering and labeling data to balance out the class label distribution can be both costly and time-consuming.Many existing solutions that enable ensemble learning, re-balancing strategies, or fine-tuning applied to deep neural networks are limited by the inert problem of few class samples across a subset of classes.Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have been observed as effective solutions to zero-shot or few-shot learning by grasping a similarity between vision and language features for image and text pairs.Considering that large pre-trained vision-language models may contain valuable side textual information for minor classes, we propose to leverage text supervision to tackle the challenge of long-tailed learning.Concretely, we propose a novel text-guided mixup technique that takes advantage of the semantic relations between classes recognized by the pre-trained text encoder to help alleviate the long-tailed problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical study on benchmark long-tailed tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal with a theoretical guarantee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/rsamf/text-guided-mixup.</p>

                  <p>In the federated learning (FL) process, since the data held by each participant is different, it is necessary to figure out which participant has a higher contribution to the model performance.Effective contribution assessment can help motivate data owners to participate in the FL training.Research works in this field can be divided into two directions based on whether a validation dataset is required.Validation-based methods need to use representative validation data to measure the model accuracy, which is difficult to obtain in practical FL scenarios.Existing validation-free methods assess the contribution based on the parameters and gradients of local models and the global model in a single training round, which is easily compromised by the stochasticity of model training.In this work, we propose CoAst, a practical method to assess the FL participants' contribution without access to any validation data.The core idea of CoAst involves two aspects: one is to only count the most important part of model parameters through a weights quantization, and the other is a cross-round valuation based on the similarity between the current local parameters and the global parameter updates in several subsequent communication rounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that CoAst has comparable assessment reliability to existing validation-based methods and outperforms existing validation-free methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have garnered growing interest in developing versatile Embodied AI systems.However, current research in this domain reveals opportunities for improvement.First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks.Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods.We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Embodied AI tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Embodied AI.By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability.Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p>

                  <p>Data scarcity poses a serious threat to modern machine learning and artificial intelligence, as their practical success typically relies on the availability of big datasets.One effective strategy to mitigate the issue of insufficient data is to first harness information from other data sources possessing certain similarities in the study design stage, and then employ the multi-task or meta learning framework in the analysis stage.In this paper, we focus on multi-task (or multi-source) linear models whose coefficients across tasks share an invariant low-rank component, a popular structural assumption considered in the recent multi-task or meta learning literature.Under this assumption, we propose a new algorithm, called Meta Subspace Pursuit (abbreviated as Meta-SP), that provably learns this invariant subspace shared by different tasks.Under this stylized setup for multi-task or meta learning, we establish both the algorithmic and statistical guarantees of the proposed method.Extensive numerical experiments are conducted, comparing Meta-SP against several competing methods, including popular, off-the-shelf model-agnostic meta learning algorithms such as ANIL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These experiments demonstrate that Meta-SP achieves superior performance over the competing methods in various aspects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>The significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks have led to a growing body of work exploring LLM-based embedding models.While these models, employing different pooling and attention strategies, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on public embedding benchmarks, questions still arise about what constitutes an effective design for LLM-based embedding models.However, these models are often trained on different datasets, using different LLM base models or training settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, evaluations on public embedding benchmarks often fail to report statistical significance, making it difficult to determine which designs truly contribute to final performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>This complicates the process for practitioners seeking optimal training recipes for LLM-based embedding models.In this study, we conduct a large-scale experiment by training a series of LLM-based embedding models using the same training data and base model but differing in their pooling and attention strategies.The results show that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: while bidirectional attention and an additional trainable pooling layer outperform in text similarity and information retrieval tasks, they do not significantly surpass simpler designs like EOS-last token pooling and default causal attention in clustering and classification tasks.Furthermore, we propose a new pooling strategy, Multi-Layers Trainable Pooling, which transforms the outputs of all hidden layers, rather than just the last layer, using a cross-attention network.This method proves to be statistically superior in text similarity and retrieval tasks compared to existing pooling methods.Overall, this paper sheds light on effective training strategies for LLM-based embedding models.</p>

                  <p>Storyline drawings are a popular visualization of interactions of a set of characters over time, e.g., to show participants of scenes in a book or movie.Characters are represented as $x$-monotone curves that converge vertically for interactions and diverge otherwise.Combinatorially, the task of computing storyline drawings reduces to finding a sequence of permutations of the character curves for the different time points, with the primary objective being crossing minimization of the induced character trajectories.In this paper, we revisit exact integer linear programming (ILP) approaches for this NP-hard problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By enriching previous formulations with additional problem-specific insights and new heuristics, we obtain exact solutions for an extended new benchmark set of larger and more complex instances than had been used before. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Our experiments show that our enriched formulations lead to better performing algorithms when compared to state-of-the-art modelling techniques.In particular, our best algorithms are on average 2.6-3.2 times faster than the state-of-the-art and succeed in solving complex instances that could not be solved before within the given time limit.Further, we show in an ablation study that our enrichment components contribute considerably to the performance of the new ILP formulation.</p>

                  <p>Visual grounding aims to localize the object referred to in an image based on a natural language query.Although progress has been made recently, accurately localizing target objects within multiple-instance distractions (multiple objects of the same category as the target) remains a significant challenge.Existing methods demonstrate a significant performance drop when there are multiple distractions in an image, indicating an insufficient understanding of the fine-grained semantics and spatial relationships between objects.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Relation and Semantic-sensitive Visual Grounding (ResVG) model, to address this issue.Firstly, we enhance the model's understanding of fine-grained semantics by injecting semantic prior information derived from text queries into the model.This is achieved by leveraging text-to-image generation models to produce images representing the semantic attributes of target objects described in queries.Secondly, we tackle the lack of training samples with multiple distractions by introducing a relation-sensitive data augmentation method.This method generates additional training data by synthesizing images containing multiple objects of the same category and pseudo queries based on their spatial relationships.The proposed ReSVG model significantly improves the model's ability to comprehend both object semantics and spatial relations, leading to enhanced performance in visual grounding tasks, particularly in scenarios with multiple-instance distractions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our methods on five datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/ResVG.</p>

                  <p>Histopathological image analysis is crucial for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.While deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have advanced this field, their "black-box" nature raises concerns about interpretability and trustworthiness.Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques aim to address these concerns, but evaluating their effectiveness remains challenging.A significant issue with current occlusion-based XAI methods is that they often generate Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples, leading to inaccurate evaluations.In this paper, we introduce Inpainting-Based Occlusion (IBO), a novel occlusion strategy that utilizes a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model to inpaint occluded regions in histopathological images.By replacing cancerous areas with realistic, non-cancerous tissue, IBO minimizes OoD artifacts and preserves data integrity.We evaluate our method on the CAMELYON16 dataset through two phases: first, by assessing perceptual similarity using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric, and second, by quantifying the impact on model predictions through Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis.Our results demonstrate that IBO significantly improves perceptual fidelity, achieving nearly twice the improvement in LPIPS scores compared to the best existing occlusion strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, IBO increased the precision of XAI performance prediction from 42% to 71% compared to traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>These results demonstrate IBO's potential to provide more reliable evaluations of XAI techniques, benefiting histopathology and other applications.The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/a-fsh-r/IBO.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning is used to align language models with human preference signals after first pre-training the model to predict the next token of text within a large corpus using likelihood maximization.Before being deployed in a specific domain, models are often further fine-tuned on task specific data.Since human preferences are often unavailable for the last step, it is performed using likelihood maximization as that is the typical default method.However, reinforcement learning has other advantages besides facilitating alignment to a human derived reward function.For one, whereas likelihood maximization is a form of imitation learning in which the model is trained on what to do under ideal conditions, reinforcement learning is not limited to demonstrating actions just for optimally reached states and trains a model what to do under a range of scenarios as it explores the policy space.In addition, it also trains a model what not to do, suppressing competitive but poor actions.This work develops a framework for last-mile fine-tuning using reinforcement learning and tests whether it garners performance gains.The experiments center on abstractive summarization, but the framework is general and broadly applicable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Use of the procedure produced significantly better results than likelihood maximization when comparing raw predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>For the specific data tested, the gap could be bridged by employing post-processing of the maximum likelihood outputs.Nonetheless, the framework offers a new avenue for model optimization in situations where post-processing may be less straightforward or effective, and it can be extended to include more complex classes of undesirable outputs to penalize and train against, such as hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>The development of software applications using multiple programming languages has increased in recent years, as it allows the selection of the most suitable language and runtime for each component of the system and the integration of third-party libraries.However, this practice involves complexity and error proneness, due to the absence of an adequate system for the interoperability of multiple programming languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers are compelled to resort to workarounds, such as library reimplementation or language-specific wrappers, which are often dependent on C as the common denominator for interoperability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These challenges render the use of multiple programming languages a burdensome and demanding task that necessitates highly skilled developers for implementation, debugging, and maintenance, and raise doubts about the benefits of interoperability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we propose MetaFFI, a pluggable in-process indirect-interoperability system that allows the loading and utilization of entities from multiple programming languages.This is achieved by exploiting the less restrictive shallow binding mechanisms (e.g., Foreign Function Interface) to offer deep binding features (e.g., object creation, methods, fields).MetaFFI provides a runtime-independent framework to load and \emph{xcall} (Cross-Call) foreign entities (e.g., functions, objects).MetaFFI uses Common Data Types (CDTs) to pass parameters and return values, including objects and complex types, and even cross-language callbacks.The indirect interoperability approach of MetaFFI has the significant advantage of requiring only $2n$ mechanisms to support $n$ languages, as opposed to the direct interoperability approaches that need $n^2$ mechanisms.We have successfully tested the binding between Go, Python3.11, and Java in a proof-of-concept on Windows and Ubuntu.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), long-context information understanding and processing have become a hot topic in academia and industry.However, benchmarks for evaluating the ability of LLMs to handle long-context information do not seem to have kept pace with the development of LLMs.Despite the emergence of various long-context evaluation benchmarks, the types of capability assessed are still limited, without new capability dimensions.In this paper, we introduce DetectiveQA, a narrative reasoning benchmark featured with an average context length of over 100K tokens.DetectiveQA focuses on evaluating the long-context reasoning ability of LLMs, which not only requires a full understanding of context but also requires extracting important evidences from the context and reasoning according to extracted evidences to answer the given questions.This is a new dimension of capability evaluation, which is more in line with the current intelligence level of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use detective novels as data sources, which naturally have various reasoning elements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Finally, we manually annotated 600 questions in Chinese and then also provided an English edition of the context information and questions.We evaluate many long-context LLMs on DetectiveQA, including commercial and open-sourced models, and the results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process true long-context dependency questions.</p>

                  <p>Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information.Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR.Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition.These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions.Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability.Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity.For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data.We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</p>

                  <p>While machine learning models have proven effective across various scenarios, it is widely acknowledged that many models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.Recently, there have emerged numerous efforts in adversarial defense.Among them, certified defense is well known for its theoretical guarantees against arbitrary adversarial perturbations on input within a certain range (e.g., $l_2$ ball).However, most existing works in this line struggle to generalize their certified robustness in other data domains with distribution shifts.This issue is rooted in the difficulty of eliminating the negative impact of spurious correlations on robustness in different domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel certified defense framework GLEAN, which incorporates a causal perspective into the generalization problem in certified defense. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.594</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More specifically, our framework integrates a certifiable causal factor learning component to disentangle the causal relations and spurious correlations between input and label, and thereby exclude the negative effect of spurious correlations on defense. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On top of that, we design a causally certified defense strategy to handle adversarial attacks on latent causal factors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>In this way, our framework is not only robust against malicious noises on data in the training distribution but also can generalize its robustness across domains with distribution shifts.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our framework in certified robustness generalization in different data domains.Code is available in the supplementary materials.</p>

                  <p>The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Deep Neural Network models has developed significantly, offering numerous techniques to extract explanations from models.However, evaluating explanations is often not trivial, and differences in applied metrics can be subtle, especially with non-intelligible data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, there is a need for visualizations tailored to explore explanations for domains with such data, e.g., time series. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>We propose DAVOTS, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore raw time series data, activations of neural networks, and attributions in a dense-pixel visualization to gain insights into the data, models' decisions, and explanations.To further support users in exploring large datasets, we apply clustering approaches to the visualized data domains to highlight groups and present ordering strategies for individual and combined data exploration to facilitate finding patterns.We visualize a CNN trained on the FordA dataset to demonstrate the approach.</p>

                  <p>Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices.This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength.For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment.Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.)for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks.To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community.We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, a more advanced form of phishing has arisen on Ethereum, surpassing early-stage, simple transaction phishing.This new form, which we refer to as payload-based transaction phishing (PTXPHISH), manipulates smart contract interactions through the execution of malicious payloads to deceive users.PTXPHISH has rapidly emerged as a significant threat, leading to incidents that caused losses exceeding \$70 million in 2023 reports.Despite its substantial impact, no previous studies have systematically explored PTXPHISH   In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of the PTXPHISH on Ethereum.Firstly, we conduct a long-term data collection and put considerable effort into establishing the first ground-truth PTXPHISH dataset, consisting of 5,000 phishing transactions.Based on the dataset, we dissect PTXPHISH, categorizing phishing tactics into four primary categories and eleven sub-categories.Secondly, we propose a rule-based multi-dimensional detection approach to identify PTXPHISH, achieving over 99% accuracy in the ground-truth dataset.Finally, we conducted a large-scale detection spanning 300 days and discovered a total of 130,637 phishing transactions on Ethereum, resulting in losses exceeding $341.9 million.Our in-depth analysis of these phishing transactions yielded valuable and insightful findings.   Furthermore, our work has made significant contributions to mitigating real-world threats.We have reported 1,726 phishing addresses to the community, accounting for 42.7% of total community contributions during the same period.Additionally, we have sent 2,539 on-chain alert messages, assisting 1,980 victims.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research serves as a valuable reference in combating the emerging PTXPHISH and safeguarding users' assets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span></p>
