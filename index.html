                  <p>Few-shot class-incremental learning is crucial for developing scalable and adaptive intelligent systems, as it enables models to acquire new classes with minimal annotated data while safeguarding the previously accumulated knowledge.Nonetheless, existing methods deal with continuous data streams in a centralized manner, limiting their applicability in scenarios that prioritize data privacy and security.To this end, this paper introduces federated few-shot class-incremental learning, a decentralized machine learning paradigm tailored to progressively learn new classes from scarce data distributed across multiple clients.In this learning paradigm, clients locally update their models with new classes while preserving data privacy, and then transmit the model updates to a central server where they are aggregated globally.However, this paradigm faces several issues, such as difficulties in few-shot learning, catastrophic forgetting, and data heterogeneity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we present a synthetic data-driven framework that leverages replay buffer data to maintain existing knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>Within this framework, a noise-aware generative replay module is developed to fine-tune local models with a balance of new and replay data, while generating synthetic data of new classes to further expand the replay buffer for future tasks.Furthermore, a class-specific weighted aggregation strategy is designed to tackle data heterogeneity by adaptively aggregating class-specific parameters based on local models performance on synthetic data.This enables effective global model optimization without direct access to client data.Comprehensive experiments across three widely-used datasets underscore the effectiveness and preeminence of the introduced framework.</p>

                  <p>The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.   While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently, few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.   We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing a small, relevant, portion of the data.   panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.   panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in terms of the other.   This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures (Jaccard, Dice, etc.).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic, and set data.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.   panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.   We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.   We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming language.</p>

                  <p>The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies.Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span>PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores.Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality.Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</p>

                  <p>Police departments around the world use two-way radio for coordination.These broadcast police communications (BPC) are a unique source of information about everyday police activity and emergency response.Yet BPC are not transcribed, and their naturalistic audio properties make automatic transcription challenging.We collect a corpus of roughly 62,000 manually transcribed radio transmissions (~46 hours of audio) to evaluate the feasibility of automatic speech recognition (ASR) using modern recognition models.We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf speech recognizers, models fine-tuned on BPC data, and customized end-to-end models.We find that both human and machine transcription is challenging in this domain.Large off-the-shelf ASR models perform poorly, but fine-tuned models can reach the approximate range of human performance.Our work suggests directions for future work, including analysis of short utterances and potential miscommunication in police radio interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our corpus and data annotation pipeline available to other researchers, to enable further research on recognition and analysis of police communication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents P2U-SLAM, a visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system with a wide Field of View (FoV) camera, which utilizes pose uncertainty and point uncertainty.While the wide FoV enables considerable repetitive observations of historical map points for matching cross-view features, the data properties of the historical map points and the poses of historical keyframes have changed during the optimization process.The neglect of data property changes triggers the absence of a partial information matrix in optimization and leads to the risk of long-term positioning performance degradation.The purpose of our research is to reduce the risk of the wide field of view visual input to the SLAM system.Based on the conditional probability model, this work reveals the definite impact of the above data properties changes on the optimization process, concretizes it as point uncertainty and pose uncertainty, and gives a specific mathematical form.P2U-SLAM respectively embeds point uncertainty and pose uncertainty into the tracking module and local mapping, and updates these uncertainties after each optimization operation including local mapping, map merging, and loop closing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from two popular public datasets with wide-FoV visual input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>P2U-SLAM shows excellent performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/BambValley/P2U-SLAM.</p>

                  <p>While success in many robotics tasks can be determined by only observing the final state and how it differs from the initial state - e.g., if an apple is picked up - many tasks require observing the full motion of the robot to correctly determine success.For example, brushing hair requires repeated strokes that correspond to the contours and type of hair.Prior works often use off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs) as success detectors; however, when success depends on the full trajectory, VLMs struggle to make correct judgments for two reasons.First, modern VLMs are trained only on single frames, and cannot capture changes over a full trajectory.Second, even if we provide state-of-the-art VLMs with an aggregate input of multiple frames, they still fail to detect success due to a lack of robot data.Our key idea is to fine-tune VLMs using abstract representations that are able to capture trajectory-level information such as the path the robot takes by overlaying keypoint trajectories on the final image.We propose motion instruction fine-tuning (MotIF), a method that fine-tunes VLMs using the aforementioned abstract representations to semantically ground the robot's behavior in the environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To benchmark and fine-tune VLMs for robotic motion understanding, we introduce the MotIF-1K dataset containing 653 human and 369 robot demonstrations across 13 task categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>MotIF assesses the success of robot motion given the image observation of the trajectory, task instruction, and motion description.Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs by at least twice in precision and 56.1% in recall, generalizing across unseen motions, tasks, and environments.Finally, we demonstrate practical applications of MotIF in refining and terminating robot planning, and ranking trajectories on how they align with task and motion descriptions.Project page: https://motif-1k.github.io</p>

                  <p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks.However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches.This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC).The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices.By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality.The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks.Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase.These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data.The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.The code is available on: https://github.com/farnooshar/EigenClusterVIS</p>

                  <p>Deep trackers have proven success in visual tracking.Typically, these trackers employ optimally pre-trained deep networks to represent all diverse objects with multi-channel features from some fixed layers.The deep networks employed are usually trained to extract rich knowledge from massive data used in object classification and so they are capable to represent generic objects very well.However, these networks are too complex to represent a specific moving object, leading to poor generalization as well as high computational and memory costs.This paper presents a novel and general framework termed channel distillation to facilitate deep trackers.To validate the effectiveness of channel distillation, we take discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and ECO for example.We demonstrate that an integrated formulation can turn feature compression, response map generation, and model update into a unified energy minimization problem to adaptively select informative feature channels that improve the efficacy of tracking moving objects on the fly.Channel distillation can accurately extract good channels, alleviating the influence of noisy channels and generally reducing the number of channels, as well as adaptively generalizing to different channels and networks.The resulting deep tracker is accurate, fast, and has low memory requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental evaluations on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span></p>

                  <p>Representing the 3D environment with instance-aware semantic and geometric information is crucial for interaction-aware robots in dynamic environments.Nonetheless, creating such a representation poses challenges due to sensor noise, instance segmentation and tracking errors, and the objects' dynamic motion.This paper introduces a novel particle-based instance-aware semantic occupancy map to tackle these challenges.Particles with an augmented instance state are used to estimate the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) of the objects and implicitly model the environment.Utilizing a State-augmented Sequential Monte Carlo PHD (S$^2$MC-PHD) filter, these particles are updated to jointly estimate occupancy status, semantic, and instance IDs, mitigating noise.Additionally, a memory module is adopted to enhance the map's responsiveness to previously observed objects.Experimental results on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics under different noise conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequent tests using real-world data further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications.The task of next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional reconstruction.Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational burden due to the use of ray-casting.To address this, this paper proposes a projection-based NBV planning framework.It can select the next best view at an extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy.This process replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the computational efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the same coverage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency and feasibility of the framework.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy in distributed machine learning.However, datasets distributed across each client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly affects the performance of the model.The traditional approach to federated learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes.Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that considers classes holistically.To address the above problems, we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare seven state-of-the-art methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution.our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.</p>

                  <p>Matching users with mutual preferences is a critical aspect of services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search.To produce recommendations in such scenarios, one can predict match probabilities and construct rankings based on these predictions.However, this direct match prediction approach often underperforms due to the extreme sparsity of match labels.Therefore, most existing methods predict preferences separately for each direction (e.g., job seeker to employer and employer to job seeker) and then aggregate the predictions to generate overall matching scores and produce recommendations.However, this typical approach often leads to practical issues, such as biased error propagation between the two models.This paper introduces and demonstrates a novel and practical solution to improve reciprocal recommendations in production by leveraging \textit{pseudo-match scores}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach generates dense and more directly relevant pseudo-match scores by combining the true match labels, which are accurate but sparse, with relatively inaccurate but dense match predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We then train a meta-model to output the final match predictions by minimizing the prediction loss against the pseudo-match scores.Our method can be seen as a \textbf{best-of-both (BoB) approach}, as it combines the high-level ideas of both direct match prediction and the two separate models approach.It also allows for user-specific weights to construct \textit{personalized} pseudo-match scores, achieving even better matching performance through appropriate tuning of the weights.Offline experiments on real-world job search data demonstrate the superior performance of our BoB method, particularly with personalized pseudo-match scores, compared to existing approaches in terms of finding potential matches.</p>

                  <p>As the complexity and connectivity of networks increase, the need for novel malware detection approaches becomes imperative.Traditional security defenses are becoming less effective against the advanced tactics of today's cyberattacks.Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has emerged as a key technology in strengthening network security, offering detailed analysis of network traffic that goes beyond simple metadata analysis.DPI examines not only the packet headers but also the payload content within, offering a thorough insight into the data traversing the network.This study proposes a novel approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) and few-shot learning to accurately recognizes novel, unseen malware types with few labels samples.Our proposed approach uses a pretrained LLM on known malware types to extract the embeddings from packets.The embeddings are then used alongside few labeled samples of an unseen malware type.This technique is designed to acclimate the model to different malware representations, further enabling it to generate robust embeddings for each trained and unseen classes.Following the extraction of embeddings from the LLM, few-shot learning is utilized to enhance performance with minimal labeled data.Our evaluation, which utilized two renowned datasets, focused on identifying malware types within network traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach shows promising results with an average accuracy of 86.35% and F1-Score of 86.40% on different malware types across the two datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have gained interest in speech-text multimodal foundation models, achieving strong performance on instruction-based speech translation (ST).However, expanding language pairs from an existing instruction-tuned ST system is costly due to the necessity of re-training on a combination of new and previous datasets.We propose to expand new language pairs by merging the model trained on new language pairs and the existing model, using task arithmetic.We find that the direct application of task arithmetic for ST causes the merged model to fail to follow instructions; thus, generating translation in incorrect languages.To eliminate language confusion, we propose an augmented task arithmetic method that merges an additional language control model.It is trained to generate the correct target language token following the instructions.Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed language control model can achieve language expansion by eliminating language confusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our MuST-C and CoVoST-2 experiments, it shows up to 4.66 and 4.92 BLEU scores improvement, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>In addition, we demonstrate the use of our task arithmetic framework can expand to a language pair where neither paired ST training data nor a pre-trained ST model is available.We first synthesize the ST system from machine translation (MT) systems via task analogy, then merge the synthesized ST system to the existing ST model.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, a critical sensor in robotics and autonomous systems, has seen significant advancements.These improvements include enhanced resolution of point clouds and the capability to provide 360{\deg} low-resolution images.These images encode various data such as depth, reflectivity, and near-infrared light within the pixels.However, an excessive density of points and conventional point cloud sampling can be counterproductive, particularly in applications such as LiDAR odometry, where misleading points and degraded geometry information may induce drift errors.Currently, extensive research efforts are being directed towards leveraging LiDAR-generated images to improve situational awareness.This paper presents a comprehensive review of current deep learning (DL) techniques, including colorization and super-resolution, which are traditionally utilized in conventional computer vision tasks.These techniques are applied to LiDAR-generated images and are analyzed qualitatively.Based on this analysis, we have developed a novel approach that selectively integrates the most suited colorization and super-resolution methods with LiDAR imagery to sample reliable points from the LiDAR point cloud.This approach aims to not only improve the accuracy of point cloud registration but also avoid mismatching caused by lacking geometry information, thereby augmenting the utility and precision of LiDAR systems in practical applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our evaluation, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to our previous work, achieving lower translation and rotation errors with a reduced number of points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems.In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request.Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event.Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake.Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract.Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation.Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge.In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget.Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning.In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs.According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop.Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes.Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</p>

                  <p>In bi-criteria optimization problems, the goal is typically to compute the set of Pareto-optimal solutions.Many algorithms for these types of problems rely on efficient merging or combining of partial solutions and filtering of dominated solutions in the resulting sets.In this article, we consider the task of computing the Pareto sum of two given Pareto sets $A, B$ of size $n$. The Pareto sum $C$ contains all non-dominated points of the Minkowski sum $M = \{a+b|a \in A, b\in B\}$. Since the Minkowski sum has a size of $n^2$, but the Pareto sum $C$ can be much smaller, the goal is to compute $C$ without having to compute and store all of $M$. We present several new algorithms for efficient Pareto sum computation, including an output-sensitive successive algorithm with a running time of $O(n \log n + nk)$ and a space consumption of $O(n+k)$ for $k=|C|$. If the elements of $C$ are streamed, the space consumption reduces to $O(n)$. For output sizes $k \geq 2n$, we prove a conditional lower bound for Pareto sum computation, which excludes running times in $O(n^{2-\delta})$ for $\delta > 0$ unless the (min,+)-convolution hardness conjecture fails.The successive algorithm matches this lower bound for $k \in \Theta(n)$. However, for $k \in \Theta(n^2)$, the successive algorithm exhibits a cubic running time.But we also present an algorithm with an output-sensitive space consumption and a running time of $O(n^2 \log n)$, which matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic factor even for large $k$.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we describe suitable engineering techniques to improve the practical running times of our algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Finally, we provide an extensive comparative experimental study on generated and real-world data.As a showcase application, we consider preprocessing-based bi-criteria route planning in road networks.</p>

                  <p>Understanding neurological disorder is a fundamental problem in neuroscience, which often requires the analysis of brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to brain networks faces challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer.It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism.A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency.Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification.Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience.This paper provides a solution for analyzing brain networks, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders.Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AngusMonroe/Contrasformer}.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain integration in industries like online advertising is hindered by its connectivity limitations to off-chain data.These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems for collecting and analyzing off-chain data.This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts.However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge.   To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems.In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake.Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract.Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available.Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters.In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty.</p>

                  <p>The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of new models and ways to process users data.The majority of work that has been done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches.However, with the emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique advantages in certain domains or applications.One of these domains is Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance.Due to its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under personalized conditions.In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class.In this way, clustering can benefit from two key advantages.Firstly, clients share only what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been enough during the training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Secondly, by sharing only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication cost.The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) have undergone remarkable development and are increasingly employed in safety-critical applications.However, recently reported data on fatal accidents involving ADSs suggests that the desired level of safety has not yet been fully achieved.Consequently, there is a growing need for more comprehensive and targeted testing approaches to ensure safe driving.Scenarios from real-world accident reports provide valuable resources for ADS testing, including critical scenarios and high-quality seeds.However, existing scenario reconstruction methods from accident reports often exhibit limited accuracy in information extraction.Moreover, due to the diversity and complexity of road environments, matching current accident information with the simulation map data for reconstruction poses significant challenges.In this paper, we design and implement SoVAR, a tool for automatically generating road-generalizable scenarios from accident reports.SoVAR utilizes well-designed prompts with linguistic patterns to guide the large language model in extracting accident information from textual data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, it formulates and solves accident-related constraints in conjunction with the extracted accident information to generate accident trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span>Finally, SoVAR reconstructs accident scenarios on various map structures and converts them into test scenarios to evaluate its capability to detect defects in industrial ADSs.We experiment with SoVAR, using accident reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's database to generate test scenarios for the industrial-grade ADS Apollo.The experimental findings demonstrate that SoVAR can effectively generate generalized accident scenarios across different road structures.Furthermore, the results confirm that SoVAR identified 5 distinct safety violation types that contributed to the crash of Baidu Apollo.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an effective method for exploiting unlabelled data to learn a high-level embedding space that can be used for various downstream tasks.However, existing methods to monitor the quality of the encoder -- either during training for one model or to compare several trained models -- still rely on access to annotated data.When SSL methodologies are applied to new data domains, a sufficiently large labelled dataset may not always be available.In this study, we propose several evaluation metrics which can be applied on the embeddings of unlabelled data and investigate their viability by comparing them to linear probe accuracy (a common metric which utilizes an annotated dataset).In particular, we apply $k$-means clustering and measure the clustering quality with the silhouette score and clustering agreement.We also measure the entropy of the embedding distribution.We find that while the clusters did correspond better to the ground truth annotations as training of the network progressed, label-free clustering metrics correlated with the linear probe accuracy only when training with SSL methods SimCLR and MoCo-v2, but not with SimSiam.Additionally, although entropy did not always have strong correlations with LP accuracy, this appears to be due to instability arising from early training, with the metric stabilizing and becoming more reliable at later stages of learning.Furthermore, while entropy generally decreases as learning progresses, this trend reverses for SimSiam.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More research is required to establish the cause for this unexpected behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Lastly, we find that while clustering based approaches are likely only viable for same-architecture comparisons, entropy may be architecture-independent.</p>

                  <p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code.Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved.To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews.Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation.Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture.However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training.This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback.To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality.Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function.Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour.Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions.For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data.Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the Gaussian derivative networks achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks.   We first experimentally demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales.Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties.We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation.   In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of Gaussian derivative networks, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have very good explainability properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices.This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength.For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment.Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.)for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks.To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community.We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

We propose a new signature called Time Valid Probabilistic Data Structure HORS (TVPD-HORS) that achieves significantly lower end-to-end delay with a tunable PQ-security for real-time applications.We harness special probabilistic data structures as an efficient one-way function at the heart of our novelty, thereby vastly fastening HORS as a primitive for NIST PQ cryptography standards.TVPD-HORS permits tunable and fast processing for varying input sizes via One-hash Bloom Filter, excelling in time valid cases, wherein authentication with shorter security parameters is used for short-lived yet safety-critical messages.We show that TVPD-HORS verification is 2.7x and 5x faster than HORS in high-security and time valid settings, respectively.TVPD-HORS key generation is also faster, with a similar signing speed to HORS.Moreover, TVPD-HORS can increase the speed of HORS variants over a magnitude of time.These features make TVPD-HORS an ideal primitive to raise high-speed time valid versions of PQ-safe standards like XMSS and SPHINCS+, paving the way for real-time authentication of next-generation networks.</p>

The results demonstrate that when compared to a variety of other models, Random Forest classification models are most effective in identifying dangerous situations and their corresponding priority levels with high accuracy (Accuracy = 85%, AUC = 0.92) at a local level while ensuring a minimum amount of false negatives.While further research and data gathering is needed to include other social and economic factors, these results provide valuable insights for law enforcement agencies to optimize resources, develop proactive deployment approaches, and adjust response patterns to enhance overall public safety outcomes in an unbiased way.</p>

                  <p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code.Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved.To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews.Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation.Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture.However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training.This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback.To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality.Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function.Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour.Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software logs, generated during the runtime of software systems, are essential for various development and analysis activities, such as anomaly detection and failure diagnosis.However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks.While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization.To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives.We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs.Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches.Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices.Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines.By combining insights from regulatory, academic, and industry perspectives, our study aims to provide a clearer framework for identifying and protecting sensitive information in software logs.</p>

                  <p>The surge in data availability has inundated decision-makers with an overwhelming array of choices.While existing approaches focus on optimizing decisions based on quantifiable metrics, practical decision-making often requires balancing measurable quantitative criteria with unmeasurable qualitative factors embedded in the broader context.In such cases, algorithms can generate high-quality recommendations, but the final decision rests with the human, who must weigh both dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We define the process of selecting the optimal set of algorithmic recommendations in this context as human-centered decision making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework called generative curation, which optimizes the true desirability of decision options by integrating both quantitative and qualitative aspects.Our framework uses a Gaussian process to model unknown qualitative factors and derives a diversity metric that balances quantitative optimality with qualitative diversity.This trade-off enables the generation of a manageable subset of diverse, near-optimal actions that are robust to unknown qualitative preferences.To operationalize this framework, we propose two implementation approaches: a generative neural network architecture that produces a distribution $\pi$ to efficiently sample a diverse set of near-optimal actions, and a sequential optimization method to iteratively generates solutions that can be easily incorporated into complex optimization formulations.We validate our approach with extensive datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing decision-making processes across a range of complex environments, with significant implications for policy and management.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain integration in industries like online advertising is hindered by its connectivity limitations to off-chain data.These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems for collecting and analyzing off-chain data.This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts.However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge.   To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems.In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request.Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event.Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake.Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract.Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available.Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span></p>
