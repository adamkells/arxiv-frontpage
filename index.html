                  <p>Human intelligence can retrieve any person according to both visual and language descriptions.However, the current computer vision community studies specific person re-identification (ReID) tasks in different scenarios separately, which limits the applications in the real world.This paper strives to resolve this problem by proposing a novel instruct-ReID task that requires the model to retrieve images according to the given image or language instructions.Instruct-ReID is the first exploration of a general ReID setting, where existing 6 ReID tasks can be viewed as special cases by assigning different instructions.To facilitate research in this new instruct-ReID task, we propose a large-scale OmniReID++ benchmark equipped with diverse data and comprehensive evaluation methods e.g., task specific and task-free evaluation settings.In the task-specific evaluation setting, gallery sets are categorized according to specific ReID tasks.We propose a novel baseline model, IRM, with an adaptive triplet loss to handle various retrieval tasks within a unified framework.For task-free evaluation setting, where target person images are retrieved from task-agnostic gallery sets, we further propose a new method called IRM++ with novel memory bank-assisted learning.Extensive evaluations of IRM and IRM++ on OmniReID++ benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 10 test sets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets, the model, and the code will be available at https://github.com/hwz-zju/Instruct-ReID <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Socio-linguistic indicators of text, such as emotion or sentiment, are often extracted using neural networks in order to better understand features of social media.One indicator that is often overlooked, however, is the presence of hazards within text.Recent psychological research suggests that statements about hazards are more believable than statements about benefits (a property known as negatively biased credulity), and that political liberals and conservatives differ in how often they share hazards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we develop a new model to detect information concerning hazards, trained on a new collection of annotated X posts, as well as urban legends annotated in previous work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>We show that not only does this model perform well (outperforming, e.g., zero-shot human annotator proxies, such as GPT-4) but that the hazard information it extracts is not strongly correlated with other indicators, namely moral outrage, sentiment, emotions, and threat words.(That said, consonant with expectations, hazard information does correlate positively with such emotions as fear, and negatively with emotions like joy.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then apply this model to three datasets: X posts about COVID-19, X posts about the 2023 Hamas-Israel war, and a new expanded collection of urban legends. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>From these data, we uncover words associated with hazards unique to each dataset as well as differences in this language between groups of users, such as conservatives and liberals, which informs what these groups perceive as hazards.We further show that information about hazards peaks in frequency after major hazard events, and therefore acts as an automated indicator of such events.Finally, we find that information about hazards is especially prevalent in urban legends, which is consistent with previous work that finds that reports of hazards are more likely to be both believed and transmitted.</p>

                  <p>Creating multilingual task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents is challenging due to the high cost of training data acquisition.Following the research trend of improving training data efficiency, we show for the first time, that in-context learning is sufficient to tackle multilingual TOD.   To handle the challenging dialogue state tracking (DST) subtask, we break it down to simpler steps that are more compatible with in-context learning where only a handful of few-shot examples are used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test our approach on the multilingual TOD dataset X-RiSAWOZ, which has 12 domains in Chinese, English, French, Korean, Hindi, and code-mixed Hindi-English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>Our turn-by-turn DST accuracy on the 6 languages range from 55.6% to 80.3%, seemingly worse than the SOTA results from fine-tuned models that achieve from 60.7% to 82.8%; our BLEU scores in the response generation (RG) subtask are also significantly lower than SOTA.   However, after manual evaluation of the validation set, we find that by correcting gold label errors and improving dataset annotation schema, GPT-4 with our prompts can achieve (1) 89.6%-96.8% accuracy in DST, and (2) more than 99% correct response generation across different languages.This leads us to conclude that current automatic metrics heavily underestimate the effectiveness of in-context learning.</p>

                  <p>Image matting aims to obtain an alpha matte that separates foreground objects from the background accurately.Recently, trimap-free matting has been well studied because it requires only the original image without any extra input.Such methods usually extract a rough foreground by itself to take place trimap as further guidance.However, the definition of 'foreground' lacks a unified standard and thus ambiguities arise.Besides, the extracted foreground is sometimes incomplete due to inadequate network design.Most importantly, there is not a large-scale real-world matting dataset, and current trimap-free methods trained with synthetic images suffer from large domain shift problems in practice.In this paper, we define the salient object as foreground, which is consistent with human cognition and annotations of the current matting dataset.Meanwhile, data and technologies in salient object detection can be transferred to matting in a breeze.To obtain a more accurate and complete alpha matte, we propose a network called \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{F}eature fusion-based \textbf{C}oarse-to-fine Network \textbf{(MFC-Net)}, which fully integrates multiple features for an accurate and complete alpha matte.Furthermore, we introduce image harmony in data composition to bridge the gap between synthetic and real images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, we establish the largest general matting dataset \textbf{(Real-19k)} in the real world to date. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span>Experiments show that our method is significantly effective on both synthetic and real-world images, and the performance in the real-world dataset is far better than existing matting-free methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although humans inherently have diverse values, current large language model (LLM) alignment methods often assume that aligning LLMs with the general public's preferences is optimal.A major challenge in adopting a more individualized approach to LLM alignment is its lack of scalability, as it involves repeatedly acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each individual's preferences.To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm where users specify what they value most within the system message, steering the LLM's generation behavior to better align with the user's intentions.However, a naive application of such an approach is non-trivial since LLMs are typically trained on a uniform system message (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant") which limits their ability to generalize to diverse, unseen system messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve this generalization, we create the Multifaceted Collection, a preference dataset with 192k combinations of values beyond generic helpfulness and harmlessness, spanning 65k user instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>Using this dataset, we train a 7B LLM called Janus and test it on 921 prompts from 5 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, FLASK, Koala, MT-Bench, and Self-Instruct) by adding various unseen system messages that reflect user preferences.Janus achieves tie+win rate of 75.2%, 72.4%, and 66.4% against Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, respectively.Unexpectedly, on three benchmarks focused on response helpfulness (AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, Arena Hard Auto v0.1), Janus also outperforms LLaMA 3 8B Instruct by a +4.0%, +0.1%, +3.0% margin, underscoring that training with a vast array of system messages could also enhance alignment to the general public's preference as well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, dataset, benchmark, and models are available at https://github.com/kaistAI/Janus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span></p>

                  <p>The surge in demand for cost-effective, durable long-term archival media, coupled with density limitations of contemporary magnetic media, has resulted in synthetic DNA emerging as a promising new alternative.Despite its benefits, storing data on DNA poses several challenges as the technology used for reading/writing data and achieving random access on DNA are highly error prone.In order to deal with such errors, it is important to design efficient pipelines that can carefully use redundancy to mask errors without amplifying overall cost.In this work, we present Columnar MOlecular Storage System (CMOSS), a novel, end-to-end DNA storage pipeline that can provide error-tolerant data storage at low read/write costs.CMOSS differs from SOTA on three fronts (i) a motif-based, vertical layout in contrast to nucleotide-based horizontal layout used by SOTA, (ii) merged consensus calling and decoding enabled by the vertical layout, and (iii) a flexible, fixed-size, block-based data organization for random access over DNA storage in contrast to the variable-sized, object-based access used by SOTA.Using an in-depth evaluation via simulation studies and real wet-lab experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of various CMOSS design choices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make the entire pipeline together with the read datasets openly available to the community for faithful reproduction and furthering research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena.As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where we assume binary effects that are recorded as high-dimensional images in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).Despite being the simplest possible setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates.To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming.Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof.We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model.Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones.Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autoformalization involves automatically translating informal math into formal theorems and proofs that are machine-verifiable.Euclidean geometry provides an interesting and controllable domain for studying autoformalization.In this paper, we introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for autoformalizing Euclidean geometry, which combines domain knowledge, SMT solvers, and large language models (LLMs).One challenge in Euclidean geometry is that informal proofs rely on diagrams, leaving gaps in texts that are hard to formalize.To address this issue, we use theorem provers to fill in such diagrammatic information automatically, so that the LLM only needs to autoformalize the explicit textual steps, making it easier for the model.We also provide automatic semantic evaluation for autoformalized theorem statements.We construct LeanEuclid, an autoformalization benchmark consisting of problems from Euclid's Elements and the UniGeo dataset formalized in the Lean proof assistant.Experiments with GPT-4 and GPT-4V show the capability and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on autoformalizing geometry problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code are available at https://github.com/loganrjmurphy/LeanEuclid. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning.Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs.This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality.Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization.These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable.Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning.In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input.Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%.Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm.Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting.The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications.In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection.This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input.We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models.Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection.We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task.First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies.Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score.Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate.Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set.Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30.Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set.In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias.Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets.Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.</p>

                  <p>Accurate surface roughness prediction is critical for ensuring high product quality, especially in areas like manufacturing and aerospace, where the smallest imperfections can compromise performance or safety.However, this is challenging due to complex, non-linear interactions among variables, which is further exacerbated with limited and imbalanced datasets.Existing methods using traditional machine learning algorithms require extensive domain knowledge for feature engineering and substantial human intervention for model selection.To address these issues, we propose NASPrecision, a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-Driven Multi-Stage Learning Framework.This innovative approach autonomously identifies the most suitable features and models for various surface roughness prediction tasks and significantly enhances the performance by multi-stage learning.Our framework operates in three stages: 1) architecture search stage, employing NAS to automatically identify the most effective model architecture; 2) initial training stage, where we train the neural network for initial predictions; 3) refinement stage, where a subsequent model is appended to refine and capture subtle variations overlooked by the initial training stage.In light of limited and imbalanced datasets, we adopt a generative data augmentation technique to balance and generate new data by learning the underlying data distribution.We conducted experiments on three distinct real-world datasets linked to different machining techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show improvements in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Standard Deviation (STD) by 18%, 31%, and 22%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>This establishes it as a robust and general solution for precise surface roughness prediction, potentially boosting production efficiency and product quality in key industries while minimizing domain expertise and human intervention.</p>

                  <p>Human intelligence can retrieve any person according to both visual and language descriptions.However, the current computer vision community studies specific person re-identification (ReID) tasks in different scenarios separately, which limits the applications in the real world.This paper strives to resolve this problem by proposing a novel instruct-ReID task that requires the model to retrieve images according to the given image or language instructions.Instruct-ReID is the first exploration of a general ReID setting, where existing 6 ReID tasks can be viewed as special cases by assigning different instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate research in this new instruct-ReID task, we propose a large-scale OmniReID++ benchmark equipped with diverse data and comprehensive evaluation methods e.g., task specific and task-free evaluation settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>In the task-specific evaluation setting, gallery sets are categorized according to specific ReID tasks.We propose a novel baseline model, IRM, with an adaptive triplet loss to handle various retrieval tasks within a unified framework.For task-free evaluation setting, where target person images are retrieved from task-agnostic gallery sets, we further propose a new method called IRM++ with novel memory bank-assisted learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations of IRM and IRM++ on OmniReID++ benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 10 test sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>The datasets, the model, and the code will be available at https://github.com/hwz-zju/Instruct-ReID</p>

                  <p>Most work treats large language models as black boxes without in-depth understanding of their internal working mechanism.In order to explain the internal representations of LLMs, we propose a gradient-based metric to assess the activation level of model parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this metric, we obtain three preliminary findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>(1) When the inputs are in the same domain, parameters in the shallow layers will be activated densely, which means a larger portion of parameters will have great impacts on the outputs.In contrast, parameters in the deep layers are activated sparsely.(2) When the inputs are across different domains, parameters in shallow layers exhibit higher similarity in the activation behavior than deep layers.(3) In deep layers, the similarity of the distributions of activated parameters is positively correlated to the empirical data relevance.Further, we develop three validation experiments to solidify these findings.(1) Firstly, starting from the first finding, we attempt to configure different prune ratios for different layers, and find this method can benefit model pruning.(2) Secondly, we find that a pruned model based on one calibration set can better handle tasks related to the calibration task than those not related, which validate the second finding.(3) Thirdly, Based on the STS-B and SICK benchmark, we find that two sentences with consistent semantics tend to share similar parameter activation patterns in deep layers, which aligns with our third finding.Our work sheds light on the behavior of parameter activation in LLMs, and we hope these findings will have the potential to inspire more practical applications.</p>

                  <p>Adaptive moment estimation (Adam), as a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) variant, has gained widespread popularity in federated learning (FL) due to its fast convergence.However, federated Adam (FedAdam) algorithms suffer from a threefold increase in uplink communication overhead compared to federated SGD (FedSGD) algorithms, which arises from the necessity to transmit both local model updates and first and second moment estimates from distributed devices to the centralized server for aggregation.Driven by this issue, we propose a novel sparse FedAdam algorithm called FedAdam-SSM, wherein distributed devices sparsify the updates of local model parameters and moment estimates and subsequently upload the sparse representations to the centralized server.To further reduce the communication overhead, the updates of local model parameters and moment estimates incorporate a shared sparse mask (SSM) into the sparsification process, eliminating the need for three separate sparse masks.Theoretically, we develop an upper bound on the divergence between the local model trained by FedAdam-SSM and the desired model trained by centralized Adam, which is related to sparsification error and imbalanced data distribution.By minimizing the divergence bound between the model trained by FedAdam-SSM and centralized Adam, we optimize the SSM to mitigate the learning performance degradation caused by sparsification error.Additionally, we provide convergence bounds for FedAdam-SSM in both convex and non-convex objective function settings, and investigate the impact of local epoch, learning rate and sparsification ratio on the convergence rate of FedAdam-SSM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that FedAdam-SSM outperforms baselines in terms of convergence rate (over 1.1$\times$ faster than the sparse FedAdam baselines) and test accuracy (over 14.5\% ahead of the quantized FedAdam baselines). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>We study the problem of robust data augmentation for regression tasks in the presence of noisy data.Data augmentation is essential for generalizing deep learning models, but most of the techniques like the popular Mixup are primarily designed for classification tasks on image data.Recently, there are also Mixup techniques that are specialized to regression tasks like C-Mixup.In comparison to Mixup, which takes linear interpolations of pairs of samples, C-Mixup is more selective in which samples to mix based on their label distances for better regression performance.However, C-Mixup does not distinguish noisy versus clean samples, which can be problematic when mixing and lead to suboptimal model performance.At the same time, robust training has been heavily studied where the goal is to train accurate models against noisy data through multiple rounds of model training.We thus propose our data augmentation strategy RC-Mixup, which tightly integrates C-Mixup with multi-round robust training methods for a synergistic effect.In particular, C-Mixup improves robust training in identifying clean data, while robust training provides cleaner data to C-Mixup for it to perform better.A key advantage of RC-Mixup is that it is data-centric where the robust model training algorithm itself does not need to be modified, but can simply benefit from data mixing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show in our experiments that RC-Mixup significantly outperforms C-Mixup and robust training baselines on noisy data benchmarks and can be integrated with various robust training methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities.In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest.However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches.Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated.In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation.In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration.We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data.We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a Finite Element Method-based calibration.Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time.This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.</p>

                  <p>Targeted and uniform interventions to a system are crucial for unveiling causal relationships.While several methods have been developed to leverage interventional data for causal structure learning, their practical application in real-world scenarios often remains challenging.Recent benchmark studies have highlighted these difficulties, even when large numbers of single-variable intervention samples are available.In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that such datasets contain a wealth of causal information that can be effectively extracted under realistic assumptions about the data distribution.More specifically, we introduce the notion of interventional faithfulness, which relies on comparisons between the marginal distributions of each variable across observational and interventional settings, and we introduce a score on causal orders.Under this assumption, we are able to prove strong theoretical guarantees on the optimum of our score that also hold for large-scale settings.To empirically verify our theory, we introduce Intersort, an algorithm designed to infer the causal order from datasets containing large numbers of single-variable interventions by approximately optimizing our score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Intersort outperforms baselines (GIES, PC and EASE) on almost all simulated data settings replicating common benchmarks in the field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Our proposed novel approach to modeling interventional datasets thus offers a promising avenue for advancing causal inference, highlighting significant potential for further enhancements under realistic assumptions.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data.To tackle this task, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task, (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations, and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features.In this paper, we introduce SCE-MAE, a framework that (1) leverages the MAE, a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task, (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns, and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust, outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of approximately 20%-44% on the landmark matching and approximately 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness in addressing the inherent uncertainty and indeterminacy in monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE).Despite their strengths, the need for large search spaces and the corresponding demand for substantial training data make these models prone to generating biomechanically unrealistic poses.This challenge is particularly noticeable in occlusion scenarios, where the complexity of inferring 3D structures from 2D images intensifies.In response to these limitations, we introduce the Discrete Diffusion Pose ($\text{Di}^2\text{Pose}$), a novel framework designed for occluded 3D HPE that capitalizes on the benefits of a discrete diffusion model.Specifically, $\text{Di}^2\text{Pose}$ employs a two-stage process: it first converts 3D poses into a discrete representation through a \emph{pose quantization step}, which is subsequently modeled in latent space through a \emph{discrete diffusion process}.This methodological innovation restrictively confines the search space towards physically viable configurations and enhances the model's capability to comprehend how occlusions affect human pose within the latent space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations conducted on various benchmarks (e.g., Human3.6M, 3DPW, and 3DPW-Occ) have demonstrated its effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs' abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards.Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation.In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with.We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry.For example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations.Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/prompt-eval.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed clients to collaboratively train models with a central server while keeping raw data locally.In practice, distinct model architectures, varying data distributions, and limited resources across local clients inevitably cause model performance degradation and a slowdown in convergence speed.However, existing FL methods can only solve some of the above heterogeneous challenges and have obvious performance limitations.Notably, a unified framework has not yet been explored to overcome these challenges.Accordingly, we propose FedHPL, a parameter-efficient unified $\textbf{Fed}$erated learning framework for $\textbf{H}$eterogeneous settings based on $\textbf{P}$rompt tuning and $\textbf{L}$ogit distillation.Specifically, we employ a local prompt tuning scheme that leverages a few learnable visual prompts to efficiently fine-tune the frozen pre-trained foundation model for downstream tasks, thereby accelerating training and improving model performance under limited local resources and data heterogeneity.Moreover, we design a global logit distillation scheme to handle the model heterogeneity and guide the local training.In detail, we leverage logits to implicitly capture local knowledge and design a weighted knowledge aggregation mechanism to generate global client-specific logits.We provide a theoretical guarantee on the generalization error bound for FedHPL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiments on various benchmark datasets under diverse settings of models and data demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art FL approaches, with less computation overhead and training rounds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>The software industry is experiencing a surge in the adoption of Continuous Integration (CI) practices, both in commercial and open-source environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CI practices facilitate the seamless integration of code changes by employing automated building and testing processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Some frameworks, such as Travis CI and GitHub Actions have significantly contributed to simplifying and enhancing the CI process, rendering it more accessible and efficient for development teams.Despite the availability these CI tools , developers continue to encounter difficulties in accurately flagging commits as either suitable for CI execution or as candidates for skipping especially for large projects with many dependencies.Inaccurate flagging of commits can lead to resource-intensive test and build processes, as even minor commits may inadvertently trigger the Continuous Integration process.The problem of detecting CI-skip commits, can be modeled as binary classification task where we decide to either build a commit or to skip it.This study proposes a novel solution that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to construct an optimal Decision Tree classifier that addresses the imbalanced nature of the data.We evaluate our solution by running a within and a cross project validation benchmark on diverse range of Open-Source projects hosted on GitHub which showcased superior results when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Conclusion: Our study indicates the effectiveness of reducing ranking errors for classifier-based effort-aware defect prediction.We recommend using EA-Z with imbalanced ensemble learning.</p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>

                  <p>We address the challenge of multi-agent cooperation, where agents achieve a common goal by interacting with a 3D scene and cooperating with decentralized agents under complex partial observations.This involves managing communication costs and optimizing interaction trajectories in dynamic environments.Our research focuses on three primary limitations of existing cooperative agent systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, current systems demonstrate inefficiency in managing acquired information through observation, resulting in declining planning performance as the environment becomes more complex with additional objects or goals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>Secondly, the neglect of false plans in partially observable settings leads to suboptimal cooperative performance, as agents struggle to adapt to environmental changes influenced by the unseen actions of other agents.Lastly, the failure to incorporate spatial data into decision-making processes restricts the agent's ability to construct optimized trajectories.To overcome these limitations, we propose the RElevance and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-3.5.REVECA leverages relevance assessment, plan validation, and spatial information to enhance the efficiency and robustness of agent cooperation in dynamic and partially observable environments while minimizing continuous communication costs and effectively managing irrelevant dummy objects.Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of REVECA over previous approaches, including those driven by GPT-4.0.Additionally, a user study highlights REVECA's potential for achieving trustworthy human-AI cooperation.We expect that REVECA will have significant applications in gaming, XR applications, educational tools, and humanoid robots, contributing to substantial economic, commercial, and academic advancements.</p>

                  <p>Autoregressively trained transformers have brought a profound revolution to the world, especially with their in-context learning (ICL) ability to address downstream tasks.Recently, several studies suggest that transformers learn a mesa-optimizer during autoregressive (AR) pretraining to implement ICL.Namely, the forward pass of the trained transformer is equivalent to optimizing an inner objective function in-context.However, whether the practical non-convex training dynamics will converge to the ideal mesa-optimizer is still unclear.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Towards filling this gap, we investigate the non-convex dynamics of a one-layer linear causal self-attention model autoregressively trained by gradient flow, where the sequences are generated by an AR process $x_{t+1} = W x_t$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>First, under a certain condition of data distribution, we prove that an autoregressively trained transformer learns $W$ by implementing one step of gradient descent to minimize an ordinary least squares (OLS) problem in-context.It then applies the learned $\widehat{W}$ for next-token prediction, thereby verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis.Next, under the same data conditions, we explore the capability limitations of the obtained mesa-optimizer.We show that a stronger assumption related to the moments of data is the sufficient and necessary condition that the learned mesa-optimizer recovers the distribution.Besides, we conduct exploratory analyses beyond the first data condition and prove that generally, the trained transformer will not perform vanilla gradient descent for the OLS problem.Finally, our simulation results verify the theoretical results.</p>

We present SOLD, a novel principled method to learn this subspace from short offline trajectories with guarantees.We then provide two methods to leverage this subspace online: LOCAL-UCB and ProBALL-UCB.We demonstrate that LOCAL-UCB enjoys $\tilde O(\min(d_A\sqrt{T}, d_K\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, where the effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is larger.ProBALL-UCB enjoys a slightly weaker guarantee, but is more practical and computationally efficient.Finally, we establish the efficacy of our methods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie recommendation data from MovieLens.</p>

                  <p>Generative retrieval, a promising new paradigm in information retrieval, employs a seq2seq model to encode document features into parameters and decode relevant document identifiers (IDs) based on search queries.Existing generative retrieval solutions typically rely on a preprocessing stage to pre-define document IDs, which can suffer from a semantic gap between these IDs and the retrieval task.However, end-to-end training for both ID assignments and retrieval tasks is challenging due to the long-tailed distribution characteristics of real-world data, resulting in inefficient and unbalanced ID space utilization.To address these issues, we propose ASI++, a novel fully end-to-end generative retrieval method that aims to simultaneously learn balanced ID assignments and improve retrieval performance.ASI++ builds on the fully end-to-end training framework of vanilla ASI and introduces several key innovations.First, a distributionally balanced criterion addresses the imbalance in ID assignments, promoting more efficient utilization of the ID space.Next, a representation bottleneck criterion enhances dense representations to alleviate bottlenecks in learning ID assignments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, an information consistency criterion integrates these processes into a joint optimization framework grounded in information theory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>We further explore various module structures for learning ID assignments, including neural quantization, differentiable product quantization, and residual quantization.Extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASI++ in improving retrieval performance and achieving balanced ID assignments.</p>

In this paper, we show that the 3D local processing in Pangu-Weather is computationally sub-optimal.We design ArchesWeather, a transformer model that combines 2D attention with a column-wise attention-based feature interaction module, and demonstrate that this design improves forecasting skill.   ArchesWeather is trained at 1.5{\deg} resolution and 24h lead time, with a training budget of a few GPU-days and a lower inference cost than competing methods.An ensemble of two of our best models shows competitive RMSE scores with the IFS HRES and outperforms the 1.4{\deg} 50-members NeuralGCM ensemble for one day ahead forecasting.

                  <p>Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima.To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis.Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data.We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network.Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework.Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness.Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.</p>

We assess the feasibility of using smaller, open-weight models to replace GPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned regimes, assuming access to only a single, low-cost GPU.We assess value-sensitive issues around bias, privacy, and abstention on three additional tasks relevant to those topics.We find that with relatively low effort, very low absolute monetary cost, and relatively little data for fine-tuning, small open-weight models can achieve competitive performance in domain-adapted tasks without sacrificing generality.We then run experiments considering practical issues in bias, privacy, and hallucination risk, finding that open models offer several benefits over closed models.We intend this work as a case study in understanding the opportunity cost of reproducibility and transparency over for-profit state-of-the-art zero shot performance, finding this cost to be marginal under realistic settings.</p>

                  <p>Camera relocalization is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics.Recent advancements in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown promise in synthesizing photo-realistic images.Several works have utilized NeRFs for refining camera poses, but they do not account for lighting changes that can affect scene appearance and shadow regions, causing a degraded pose optimization process.In this paper, we propose a two-staged pipeline that normalizes images with varying lighting and shadow conditions to improve camera relocalization.We implement our scene representation upon a hash-encoded NeRF which significantly boosts up the pose optimization process.To account for the noisy image gradient computing problem in grid-based NeRFs, we further propose a re-devised truncated dynamic low-pass filter (TDLF) and a numerical gradient averaging technique to smoothen the process.Experimental results on several datasets with varying lighting conditions demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in camera relocalization under varying lighting conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span></p>
