                  <p>Effective weed control plays a crucial role in optimizing crop yield and enhancing agricultural product quality.However, the reliance on herbicide application not only poses a critical threat to the environment but also promotes the emergence of resistant weeds.Fortunately, recent advances in precision weed management enabled by ML and DL provide a sustainable alternative.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite great progress, existing algorithms are mainly developed based on supervised learning approaches, which typically demand large-scale datasets with manual-labeled annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>As such, label-efficient learning methods, especially semi-supervised learning, have gained increased attention in the broader domain of computer vision and have demonstrated promising performance.These methods aim to utilize a small number of labeled data samples along with a great number of unlabeled samples to develop high-performing models comparable to the supervised learning counterpart trained on a large amount of labeled data samples.In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a semi-supervised learning framework for multi-class weed detection, employing two well-known object detection frameworks, namely FCOS and Faster-RCNN.Specifically, we evaluate a generalized student-teacher framework with an improved pseudo-label generation module to produce reliable pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data.To enhance generalization, an ensemble student network is employed to facilitate the training process.Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve approximately 76\% and 96\% detection accuracy as the supervised methods with only 10\% of labeled data in CottenWeedDet3 and CottonWeedDet12, respectively.We offer access to the source code, contributing a valuable resource for ongoing semi-supervised learning research in weed detection and beyond.</p>

                  <p>Pre-training has been investigated to improve the efficiency and performance of training neural operators in data-scarce settings.However, it is largely in its infancy due to the inherent complexity and diversity, such as long trajectories, multiple scales and varying dimensions of partial differential equations (PDEs) data.In this paper, we present a new auto-regressive denoising pre-training strategy, which allows for more stable and efficient pre-training on PDE data and generalizes to various downstream tasks.Moreover, by designing a flexible and scalable model architecture based on Fourier attention, we can easily scale up the model for large-scale pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train our PDE foundation model with up to 0.5B parameters on 10+ PDE datasets with more than 100k trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Extensive experiments show that we achieve SOTA on these benchmarks and validate the strong generalizability of our model to significantly enhance performance on diverse downstream PDE tasks like 3D data.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/thu-ml/DPOT}.</p>

                  <p>It is especially challenging to achieve real-time human motion tracking on a standalone VR Head-Mounted Display (HMD) such as Meta Quest and PICO.In this paper, we propose HMD-Poser, the first unified approach to recover full-body motions using scalable sparse observations from HMD and body-worn IMUs.In particular, it can support a variety of input scenarios, such as HMD, HMD+2IMUs, HMD+3IMUs, etc.The scalability of inputs may accommodate users' choices for both high tracking accuracy and easy-to-wear.A lightweight temporal-spatial feature learning network is proposed in HMD-Poser to guarantee that the model runs in real-time on HMDs.Furthermore, HMD-Poser presents online body shape estimation to improve the position accuracy of body joints.Extensive experimental results on the challenging AMASS dataset show that HMD-Poser achieves new state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and real-time performance.We also build a new free-dancing motion dataset to evaluate HMD-Poser's on-device performance and investigate the performance gap between synthetic data and real-captured sensor data.Finally, we demonstrate our HMD-Poser with a real-time Avatar-driving application on a commercial HMD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and free-dancing motion dataset are available https://pico-ai-team.github.io/hmd-poser <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, there are plenty of data sources generating massive amounts of information that, combined with novel data analytics frameworks, are meant to support optimisation in many application domains.Nonetheless, there are still shortcomings in terms of data discoverability, accessibility and interoperability.Open Data portals have emerged as a shift towards openness and discoverability.However, they do not impose any condition to the data itself, just stipulate how datasets have to be described.Alternatively, the NGSI-LD standard pursues harmonisation in terms of data modelling and accessibility.This paper presents a solution that bridges these two domains (i.e., Open Data portals and NGSI-LD-based data) in order to keep benefiting from the structured description of datasets offered by Open Data portals, while ensuring the interoperability provided by the NGSI-LD standard.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our solution aggregates the data into coherent datasets and generate high-quality descriptions, ensuring comprehensiveness, interoperability and accessibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>The proposed solution has been validated through a real-world implementation that exposes IoT data in NGSI-LD format through the European Data Portal (EDP).Moreover, the results from the Metadata Quality Assessment that the EDP implements, show that the datasets' descriptions generated achieve excellent ranking in terms of the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) data principles.</p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>National Security Letters (NSLs) are similar to administrative subpoenas and can be issued directly by elements of the executive branch without requiring prior approval from a court or grand jury.Importantly, NSLs authorize the imposition of nondisclosure orders (aka "gag orders") on the receiving party.Controversy about potential abuses of this authority has driven a range of legal and policy discussions.To address these concerns, both the public sector and the private sector have sought to document the usage of NSLs in aggregated form.However, each data source is limited in scope, time, and kind.   In this paper, we consolidate the available data around NSLs and answer two questions: (1) what can the public effectively learn from the reported data and does this information suffice to assess the NSL usage?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) how accessible is this data collection? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>We show that longitudinal trends in the usage of NSLs can be observed.For instance, we find a significant increase in NSL requests for non-US persons and that the policy reforms to decrease the mandated nondisclosure period appear to be effective.The observed trends suggest that the current transparency mechanisms are viable safeguards against the excessive use of NSLs.However, aggregating and normalizing the data requires manual reviewing, parsing, and validating.We even find inconsistencies within and across official data sources.Overall, the laborious data collection process hinders external and internal auditing efforts and demonstrates the need for a unified and more usable dataset for NSLs.</p>

                  <p>Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure.Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health.Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings.However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes.In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation.Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem.In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set.Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes.CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets.Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation.LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zy1296/CrackNex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reward hacking occurs when an agent performs very well with respect to a "proxy" reward function (which may be hand-specified or learned), but poorly with respect to the unknown true reward.Since ensuring good alignment between the proxy and true reward is extremely difficult, one approach to prevent reward hacking is optimizing the proxy conservatively.Prior work has particularly focused on enforcing the learned policy to behave similarly to a "safe" policy by penalizing the KL divergence between their action distributions (AD).However, AD regularization doesn't always work well since a small change in action distribution at a single state can lead to potentially calamitous outcomes, while large changes might not be indicative of any dangerous activity.Our insight is that when reward hacking, the agent visits drastically different states from those reached by the safe policy, causing large deviations in state occupancy measure (OM).Thus, we propose regularizing based on the OM divergence between policies instead of AD divergence to prevent reward hacking.We theoretically establish that OM regularization can more effectively avoid large drops in true reward.Then, we empirically demonstrate in a variety of realistic environments that OM divergence is superior to AD divergence for preventing reward hacking by regularizing towards a safe policy.Furthermore, we show that occupancy measure divergence can also regularize learned policies away from reward hacking behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/orpo <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span></p>

                  <p>Educational chatbots are a promising tool for assisting student learning.However, the development of effective chatbots in education has been challenging, as high-quality data is seldom available in this domain.In this paper, we propose a framework for generating synthetic teacher-student interactions grounded in a set of textbooks.Our approaches capture one aspect of learning interactions where curious students with partial knowledge interactively ask a teacher questions about the material in the textbook.We highlight various quality criteria that such dialogues should fulfill and compare several approaches relying on either prompting or fine-tuning large language models.We use synthetic dialogues to train educational chatbots and show benefits of further fine-tuning in different educational domains.However, human evaluation shows that our best data synthesis method still suffers from hallucinations and tends to reiterate information from previous conversations.Our findings offer insights for future efforts in synthesizing conversational data that strikes a balance between size and quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will open-source our data and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding a surgical scene is crucial for computer-assisted surgery systems to provide any intelligent assistance functionality.One way of achieving this scene understanding is via scene segmentation, where every pixel of a frame is classified and therefore identifies the visible structures and tissues.Progress on fully segmenting surgical scenes has been made using machine learning.However, such models require large amounts of annotated training data, containing examples of all relevant object classes.Such fully annotated datasets are hard to create, as every pixel in a frame needs to be annotated by medical experts and, therefore, are rarely available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a method to combine multiple partially annotated datasets, which provide complementary annotations, into one model, enabling better scene segmentation and the use of multiple readily available datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span>Our method aims to combine available data with complementary labels by leveraging mutual exclusive properties to maximize information.Specifically, we propose to use positive annotations of other classes as negative samples and to exclude background pixels of binary annotations, as we cannot tell if they contain a class not annotated but predicted by the model.We evaluate our method by training a DeepLabV3 on the publicly available Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset, which provides multiple subsets of binary segmented anatomical structures.Our approach successfully combines 6 classes into one model, increasing the overall Dice Score by 4.4% compared to an ensemble of models trained on the classes individually.By including information on multiple classes, we were able to reduce confusion between stomach and colon by 24%.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training a model on multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paves the way for future work further alleviating the need for one large, fully segmented datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Neural Networks (NNs) have surpassed human accuracy in image classification on ImageNet, they often lack robustness against image corruption, i.e., corruption robustness.Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception.In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation.To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation.Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span></p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), also called zero-shot or dataless text classification, has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability in classifying a mass of texts within the dynamic and open Web environment, since it requires only a limited set of seed words (label names) for each category instead of labeled data.With the help of recently popular prompting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), many studies leveraged manually crafted and/or automatically identified verbalizers to estimate the likelihood of categories, but they failed to differentiate the effects of these category-indicative words, let alone capture their correlations and realize adaptive adjustments according to the unlabeled corpus.In this paper, in order to let the PLM effectively understand each category, we at first propose a novel form of rule-based knowledge using logical expressions to characterize the meanings of categories.Then, we develop a prompting PLM-based approach named RulePrompt for the WSTC task, consisting of a rule mining module and a rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module, plus a self-supervised fine-tuning module to make the PLM align with this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, the inaccurate pseudo labels assigned to texts and the imprecise logical rules associated with categories mutually enhance each other in an alternative manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>That establishes a self-iterative closed loop of knowledge (rule) acquisition and utilization, with seed words serving as the starting point.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which markedly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.What is more, our approach yields interpretable category rules, proving its advantage in disambiguating easily-confused categories.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm enabling collaborative model training on decentralized devices without exposing their local data.A key challenge in FL is the uneven data distribution across client devices, violating the well-known assumption of independent-and-identically-distributed (IID) training samples in conventional machine learning.Clustered federated learning (CFL) addresses this challenge by grouping clients based on the similarity of their data distributions.However, existing CFL approaches require a large number of communication rounds for stable cluster formation and rely on a predefined number of clusters, thus limiting their flexibility and adaptability.This paper proposes FedClust, a novel CFL approach leveraging correlations between local model weights and client data distributions.FedClust groups clients into clusters in a one-shot manner using strategically selected partial model weights and dynamically accommodates newcomers in real-time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate FedClust outperforms baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and communication costs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span></p>

                  <p>Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to query the unseen facts of a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs.The side effect of noises due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning, but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more susceptible to limited reference samples with noises.In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning representations under Gaussian distribution.Uncertainty representation is first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution.Further, to better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions.Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the optimization.The final completion score for each query instance is measured by the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the noises in few-shot scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our approach achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

In this paper, we develop an approach to reliably augment the implementation with explanatory names.We recover fine-grained input-output data from the synthesis algorithm to enhance the prompt supplied to the LLM, and use a combination of a program verifier and a second language model to validate the proposed explanations before presenting them to the user.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, these techniques massively improve the accuracy of the proposed names, from 24% to 79% respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Through a pair of small user studies, we find that users significantly prefer the explanations produced by our technique (76% of responses indicating the appropriateness of the presenting names) to the baseline (with only 2% of responses approving of the suggestions), and that the proposed names measurably help users in understanding the synthesized implementation.</p>

                  <p>Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn novel tasks with very few labeled samples by leveraging experience from \emph{related} training tasks.In this paper, we try to understand FSL by delving into two key questions: (1) How to quantify the relationship between \emph{training} and \emph{novel} tasks?(2) How does the relationship affect the \emph{adaptation difficulty} on novel tasks for different models?To answer the two questions, we introduce Task Attribute Distance (TAD) built upon attributes as a metric to quantify the task relatedness.Unlike many existing metrics, TAD is model-agnostic, making it applicable to different FSL models.Then, we utilize TAD metric to establish a theoretical connection between task relatedness and task adaptation difficulty.By deriving the generalization error bound on a novel task, we discover how TAD measures the adaptation difficulty on novel tasks for FSL models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our TAD metric and theoretical findings, we conduct experiments on three benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>Our experimental results confirm that TAD metric effectively quantifies the task relatedness and reflects the adaptation difficulty on novel tasks for various FSL methods, even if some of them do not learn attributes explicitly or human-annotated attributes are not available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we present two applications of the proposed TAD metric: data augmentation and test-time intervention, which further verify its effectiveness and general applicability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/hu-my/TaskAttributeDistance.</p>

                  <p>The significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) give rise to a promising research direction, i.e., leveraging LLMs as recommenders (LLMRec).The efficacy of LLMRec arises from the open-world knowledge and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.LLMRec acquires the recommendation capabilities through instruction tuning based on user interaction data.However, in order to protect user privacy and optimize utility, it is also crucial for LLMRec to intentionally forget specific user data, which is generally referred to as recommendation unlearning.In the era of LLMs, recommendation unlearning poses new challenges for LLMRec in terms of \textit{inefficiency} and \textit{ineffectiveness}.Existing unlearning methods require updating billions of parameters in LLMRec, which is costly and time-consuming.Besides, they always impact the model utility during the unlearning process.To this end, we propose \textbf{E2URec}, the first \underline{E}fficient and \underline{E}ffective \underline{U}nlearning method for LLM\underline{Rec}.Our proposed E2URec enhances the unlearning efficiency by updating only a few additional LoRA parameters, and improves the unlearning effectiveness by employing a teacher-student framework, where we maintain multiple teacher networks to guide the unlearning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that E2URec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Specifically, E2URec can efficiently forget specific data without affecting recommendation performance.The source code is at \url{https://github.com/justarter/E2URec}.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel multi-modal Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) algorithm for self-driving cars that combines camera and LiDAR data.Camera frames are processed with a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, whereas classical clustering techniques are used to process LiDAR observations.The proposed MOT algorithm comprises a three-step association process, an Extended Kalman filter for estimating the motion of each detected dynamic obstacle, and a track management phase.The EKF motion model requires the current measured relative position and orientation of the observed object and the longitudinal and angular velocities of the ego vehicle as inputs.Unlike most state-of-the-art multi-modal MOT approaches, the proposed algorithm does not rely on maps or knowledge of the ego global pose.Moreover, it uses a 3D detector exclusively for cameras and is agnostic to the type of LiDAR sensor used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The algorithm is validated both in simulation and with real-world data, with satisfactory results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt learning has emerged as a valuable technique in enhancing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP for downstream tasks in specific domains.Existing work mainly focuses on designing various learning forms of prompts, neglecting the potential of prompts as effective distillers for learning from larger teacher models.In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised domain prompt distillation framework, which aims to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a lightweight target model through prompt-driven imitation using unlabeled domain images.Specifically, our framework consists of two distinct stages.In the initial stage, we pre-train a large CLIP teacher model using domain (few-shot) labels.After pre-training, we leverage the unique decoupled-modality characteristics of CLIP by pre-computing and storing the text features as class vectors only once through the teacher text encoder.In the subsequent stage, the stored class vectors are shared across teacher and student image encoders for calculating the predicted logits.Further, we align the logits of both the teacher and student models via KL divergence, encouraging the student image encoder to generate similar probability distributions to the teacher through the learnable prompts.The proposed prompt distillation process eliminates the reliance on labeled data, enabling the algorithm to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled images within the domain.Finally, the well-trained student image encoders and pre-stored text features (class vectors) are utilized for inference.To our best knowledge, we are the first to (1) perform unsupervised domain-specific prompt-driven knowledge distillation for CLIP, and (2) establish a practical pre-storing mechanism of text features as shared class vectors between teacher and student.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>End-to-end differentiable learning for autonomous driving (AD) has recently become a prominent paradigm.One main bottleneck lies in its voracious appetite for high-quality labeled data e.g. 3D bounding boxes and semantic segmentation, which are notoriously expensive to manually annotate.The difficulty is further pronounced due to the prominent fact that the behaviors within samples in AD often suffer from long tailed distribution.In other words, a large part of collected data can be trivial (e.g. simply driving forward in a straight road) and only a few cases are safety-critical.In this paper, we explore a practically important yet under-explored problem about how to achieve sample and label efficiency for end-to-end AD.Specifically, we design a planning-oriented active learning method which progressively annotates part of collected raw data according to the proposed diversity and usefulness criteria for planning routes.Empirically, we show that our planning-oriented approach could outperform general active learning methods by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art end-to-end AD methods - by using only 30% nuScenes data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>We hope our work could inspire future works to explore end-to-end AD from a data-centric perspective in addition to methodology efforts.</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), also called zero-shot or dataless text classification, has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability in classifying a mass of texts within the dynamic and open Web environment, since it requires only a limited set of seed words (label names) for each category instead of labeled data.With the help of recently popular prompting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), many studies leveraged manually crafted and/or automatically identified verbalizers to estimate the likelihood of categories, but they failed to differentiate the effects of these category-indicative words, let alone capture their correlations and realize adaptive adjustments according to the unlabeled corpus.In this paper, in order to let the PLM effectively understand each category, we at first propose a novel form of rule-based knowledge using logical expressions to characterize the meanings of categories.Then, we develop a prompting PLM-based approach named RulePrompt for the WSTC task, consisting of a rule mining module and a rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module, plus a self-supervised fine-tuning module to make the PLM align with this task.Within this framework, the inaccurate pseudo labels assigned to texts and the imprecise logical rules associated with categories mutually enhance each other in an alternative manner.That establishes a self-iterative closed loop of knowledge (rule) acquisition and utilization, with seed words serving as the starting point.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which markedly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>What is more, our approach yields interpretable category rules, proving its advantage in disambiguating easily-confused categories.</p>

                  <p>Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) aims to locate sounding objects within video frames given the paired audio clips.Existing methods predominantly rely on self-supervised contrastive learning of audio-visual correspondence.Without any bounding-box annotations, they struggle to achieve precise localization, especially for small objects, and suffer from blurry boundaries and false positives.Moreover, the naive semi-supervised method is poor in fully leveraging the information of abundant unlabeled data.In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for AVSL, namely Dual Mean-Teacher (DMT), comprising two teacher-student structures to circumvent the confirmation bias issue.Specifically, two teachers, pre-trained on limited labeled data, are employed to filter out noisy samples via the consensus between their predictions, and then generate high-quality pseudo-labels by intersecting their confidence maps.The sufficient utilization of both labeled and unlabeled data and the proposed unbiased framework enable DMT to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with CIoU of 90.4% and 48.8% on Flickr-SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source, obtaining 8.9%, 9.6% and 4.6%, 6.4% improvements over self- and semi-supervised methods respectively, given only 3% positional-annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also extend our framework to some existing AVSL methods and consistently boost their performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing InferGuard, a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation rule aimed at defending against client-side training data distribution inference attacks.In our proposed InferGuard, the server first calculates the coordinate-wise median of all the model updates it receives.A client's model update is considered malicious if it significantly deviates from the computed median update.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed InferGuard on five benchmark datasets and perform a comparison with ten baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>The results of our experiments indicate that our defense mechanism is highly effective in protecting against client-side training data distribution inference attacks, even against strong adaptive attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our method substantially outperforms the baseline methods in various practical FL scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

To better facilitate analysis of cross-domain DocEAE, we additionally introduce a new metric, Role-Depth F1 (RDF1), which uses statistical depth to identify roles in the target domain which are semantic outliers with respect to roles observed in the source domain.Our experiments show that MLA augmentation can boost RDF1 performance by an average of 5.85 points compared to non-augmented datasets.</p>

We formalize "Corrective Machine Unlearning" as the problem of mitigating the impact of data affected by unknown manipulations on a trained model, possibly knowing only a subset of impacted samples.We demonstrate that the problem of corrective unlearning has significantly different requirements from traditional privacy-oriented unlearning.We find most existing unlearning methods, including the gold-standard retraining-from-scratch, require most of the manipulated data to be identified for effective corrective unlearning.However, one approach, SSD, achieves limited success in unlearning adverse effects with just a small portion of the manipulated samples, showing the tractability of this setting.We hope our work spurs research towards developing better methods for corrective unlearning and offers practitioners a new strategy to handle data integrity challenges arising from web-scale training.</p>

                  <p>Traditional sequential recommendation methods assume that users' sequence data is clean enough to learn accurate sequence representations to reflect user preferences.In practice, users' sequences inevitably contain noise (e.g., accidental interactions), leading to incorrect reflections of user preferences.Consequently, some pioneer studies have explored modeling sequentiality and correlations in sequences to implicitly or explicitly reduce noise's influence.However, relying on only available intra-sequence information (i.e., sequentiality and correlations in a sequence) is insufficient and may result in over-denoising and under-denoising problems (OUPs), especially for short sequences.To improve reliability, we propose to augment sequences by inserting items before denoising.However, due to the data sparsity issue and computational costs, it is challenging to select proper items from the entire item universe to insert into proper positions in a target sequence.Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel framework--Self-augmented Sequence Denoising for sequential Recommendation (SSDRec) with a three-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges.In the first stage, we empower SSDRec by a global relation encoder to learn multi-faceted inter-sequence relations in a data-driven manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These relations serve as prior knowledge to guide subsequent stages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>In the second stage, we devise a self-augmentation module to augment sequences to alleviate OUPs.Finally, we employ a hierarchical denoising module in the third stage to reduce the risk of false augmentations and pinpoint all noise in raw sequences.Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of \model over state-of-the-art denoising methods and its flexible applications to mainstream sequential recommendation models.The source code is available at https://github.com/zc-97/SSDRec.</p>

                  <p>While standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training is proven effective for image classification on in-distribution data, it fails to perform well on out-of-distribution samples.One of the main sources of distribution shift for image classification is the compositional nature of images.Specifically, in addition to the main object or component(s) determining the label, some other image components usually exist, which may lead to the shift of input distribution between train and test environments.More importantly, these components may have spurious correlations with the label.To address this issue, we propose Decompose-and-Compose (DaC), which improves robustness to correlation shift by a compositional approach based on combining elements of images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our observations, models trained with ERM usually highly attend to either the causal components or the components having a high spurious correlation with the label (especially in datapoints on which models have a high confidence). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In fact, according to the amount of spurious correlation and the easiness of classification based on the causal or non-causal components, the model usually attends to one of these more (on samples with high confidence). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Following this, we first try to identify the causal components of images using class activation maps of models trained with ERM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Afterward, we intervene on images by combining them and retraining the model on the augmented data, including the counterfactual ones.Along with its high interpretability, this work proposes a group-balancing method by intervening on images without requiring group labels or information regarding the spurious features during training.The method has an overall better worst group accuracy compared to previous methods with the same amount of supervision on the group labels in correlation shift.</p>

SA-ICM is also robust to changes in input data, making it effective for a variety of use cases.   Additionally, our method provides benefits from a privacy point of view, as it removes human facial information on the encoder's side, thus protecting one's privacy.   Furthermore, this LIC model training method can be used to train Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV), which is a video compression model.   By training NeRV using edge information created by Segment Anything, it is possible to create a NeRV that is effective for image recognition (SA-NeRV).   Experimental results confirm the advantages of SA-ICM, presenting the best performance in image compression for image recognition.   We also show that SA-NeRV is superior to ordinary NeRV in video compression for machines.</p>

                  <p>To date, toxicity mitigation in language models has almost entirely been focused on single-language settings.As language models embrace multilingual capabilities, it's crucial our safety measures keep pace.Recognizing this research gap, our approach expands the scope of conventional toxicity mitigation to address the complexities presented by multiple languages.In the absence of sufficient annotated datasets across languages, we employ translated data to evaluate and enhance our mitigation techniques.We also compare finetuning mitigation approaches against retrieval-augmented techniques under both static and continual toxicity mitigation scenarios.This allows us to examine the effects of translation quality and the cross-lingual transfer on toxicity mitigation.We also explore how model size and data quantity affect the success of these mitigation efforts.Covering nine languages, our study represents a broad array of linguistic families and levels of resource availability, ranging from high to mid-resource languages.Through comprehensive experiments, we provide insights into the complexities of multilingual toxicity mitigation, offering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in this increasingly important field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/for-ai/goodtriever. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span></p>
