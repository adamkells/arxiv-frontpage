                  <p>We present AGL-NET, a novel learning-based method for global localization using LiDAR point clouds and satellite maps.AGL-NET tackles two critical challenges: bridging the representation gap between image and points modalities for robust feature matching, and handling inherent scale discrepancies between global view and local view.To address these challenges, AGL-NET leverages a unified network architecture with a novel two-stage matching design.The first stage extracts informative neural features directly from raw sensor data and performs initial feature matching.The second stage refines this matching process by extracting informative skeleton features and incorporating a novel scale alignment step to rectify scale variations between LiDAR and map data.Furthermore, a novel scale and skeleton loss function guides the network toward learning scale-invariant feature representations, eliminating the need for pre-processing satellite maps.This significantly improves real-world applicability in scenarios with unknown map scales.To facilitate rigorous performance evaluation, we introduce a meticulously designed dataset within the CARLA simulator specifically tailored for metric localization training and assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in various tasks necessitating sophisticated cognitive behaviors.Nevertheless, a paradoxical performance discrepancy is observed, where these models underperform in seemingly elementary tasks like relation extraction and event extraction due to two issues in conventional evaluation.(1) The imprecision of existing evaluation metrics that struggle to effectively gauge semantic consistency between model outputs and ground truth, and (2) The inherent incompleteness of evaluation benchmarks, primarily due to restrictive human annotation schemas, resulting in underestimated LLM performances.Inspired by the principles in subjective question correction, we propose a new evaluation method, SQC-Score.This method innovatively utilizes LLMs, fine-tuned through subjective question correction data, to refine matching between model outputs and golden labels.Additionally, by incorporating a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model, SQC-Score enriches golden labels, addressing benchmark incompleteness by acknowledging correct yet previously omitted answers.Results on three information extraction tasks show that SQC-Score is more preferred by human annotators than the baseline metrics.Utilizing SQC-Score, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art LLMs and provide insights for future research for information extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and associated codes can be accessed at https://github.com/THU-KEG/SQC-Score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>The sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between training and testing environments, poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL).A promising approach to addressing this challenge is distributionally robust RL, often framed as a robust Markov decision process (RMDP).In this framework, the objective is to find a robust policy that achieves good performance under the worst-case scenario among all environments within a pre-specified uncertainty set centered around the training environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike previous work, which relies on a generative model or a pre-collected offline dataset enjoying good coverage of the deployment environment, we tackle robust RL via interactive data collection, where the learner interacts with the training environment only and refines the policy through trial and error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>In this robust RL paradigm, two main challenges emerge: managing distributional robustness while striking a balance between exploration and exploitation during data collection.Initially, we establish that sample-efficient learning without additional assumptions is unattainable owing to the curse of support shift; i.e., the potential disjointedness of the distributional supports between the training and testing environments.To circumvent such a hardness result, we introduce the vanishing minimal value assumption to RMDPs with a total-variation (TV) distance robust set, postulating that the minimal value of the optimal robust value function is zero.We prove that such an assumption effectively eliminates the support shift issue for RMDPs with a TV distance robust set, and present an algorithm with a provable sample complexity guarantee.Our work makes the initial step to uncovering the inherent difficulty of robust RL via interactive data collection and sufficient conditions for designing a sample-efficient algorithm accompanied by sharp sample complexity analysis.</p>

                  <p>Image forgery is a topic that has been studied for many years.Before the breakthrough of deep learning, forged images were detected using handcrafted features that did not require training.These traditional methods failed to perform satisfactorily even on datasets much worse in quality than real-life image manipulations.Advances in deep learning have impacted image forgery detection as much as they have impacted other areas of computer vision and have improved the state of the art.Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training.In the case of image forgery, labeled data at the pixel level is a very important factor for the models to learn.None of the existing datasets have sufficient size, realism and pixel-level labeling at the same time.This is due to the high cost of producing and labeling quality images.It can take hours for an image editing expert to manipulate just one image.To bridge this gap, we automate data generation using image composition techniques that are very related to image forgery.Unlike other automated data generation frameworks, we use state of the art image composition deep learning models to generate spliced images close to the quality of real-life manipulations.Finally, we test the generated dataset on the SOTA image manipulation detection model and show that its prediction performance is lower compared to existing datasets, i.e. we produce realistic images that are more difficult to detect.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset will be available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIS25k . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.983</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks.In ViT, we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self attention blocks.However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ViTs simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g., locality,etc. ).Due to this, ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training.Various data efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively.However, limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>In DeiT-LT, we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes.This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks, improving generalization for tail classes.Further, to mitigate overfitting, we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher, which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks.With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme, the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes, and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes.The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture.We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.</p>

                  <p>Microservice architecture has become a dominant architectural style in the service-oriented software industry.Poor practices in the design and development of microservices are called microservice bad smells.In microservice bad smells research, the detection of these bad smells relies on feature data from microservices.However, there is a lack of an appropriate open-source microservice feature dataset.The availability of such datasets may contribute to the detection of microservice bad smells unexpectedly.To address this research gap, this paper collects a number of open-source microservice systems utilizing Spring Cloud.Additionally, feature metrics are established based on the architecture and interactions of Spring Boot style microservices.And an extraction program is developed.The program is then applied to the collected open-source microservice systems, extracting the necessary information, and undergoing manual verification to create an open-source feature dataset specific to microservice systems using Spring Cloud.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is made available through a CSV file. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.981</span></span>We believe that both the extraction program and the dataset have the potential to contribute to the study of micro-service bad smells.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge base question generation (KBQG) aims to generate natural language questions from a set of triplet facts extracted from KB.Existing methods have significantly boosted the performance of KBQG via pre-trained language models (PLMs) thanks to the richly endowed semantic knowledge.With the advance of pre-training techniques, large language models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-3.5) undoubtedly possess much more semantic knowledge.Therefore, how to effectively organize and exploit the abundant knowledge for KBQG becomes the focus of our study.In this work, we propose SGSH--a simple and effective framework to Stimulate GPT-3.5 with Skeleton Heuristics to enhance KBQG.The framework incorporates "skeleton heuristics", which provides more fine-grained guidance associated with each input to stimulate LLMs to generate optimal questions, encompassing essential elements like the question phrase and the auxiliary verb.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More specifically, we devise an automatic data construction strategy leveraging ChatGPT to construct a skeleton training dataset, based on which we employ a soft prompting approach to train a BART model dedicated to generating the skeleton associated with each input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Subsequently, skeleton heuristics are encoded into the prompt to incentivize GPT-3.5 to generate desired questions.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGSH derives the new state-of-the-art performance on the KBQG tasks.</p>

                  <p>To address the global issue of hateful content proliferating in online platforms, hate speech detection (HSD) models are typically developed on datasets collected in the United States, thereby failing to generalize to English dialects from the Majority World.Furthermore, HSD models are often evaluated on curated samples, raising concerns about overestimating model performance in real-world settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce NaijaHate, the first dataset annotated for HSD which contains a representative sample of Nigerian tweets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>We demonstrate that HSD evaluated on biased datasets traditionally used in the literature largely overestimates real-world performance on representative data.We also propose NaijaXLM-T, a pretrained model tailored to the Nigerian Twitter context, and establish the key role played by domain-adaptive pretraining and finetuning in maximizing HSD performance.Finally, we show that in this context, a human-in-the-loop approach to content moderation where humans review 1% of Nigerian tweets flagged as hateful would enable to moderate 60% of all hateful content.Taken together, these results pave the way towards robust HSD systems and a better protection of social media users from hateful content in low-resource settings.</p>

                  <p>Action recognition from video data forms a cornerstone with wide-ranging applications.Single-view action recognition faces limitations due to its reliance on a single viewpoint.In contrast, multi-view approaches capture complementary information from various viewpoints for improved accuracy.Recently, event cameras have emerged as innovative bio-inspired sensors, leading to advancements in event-based action recognition.However, existing works predominantly focus on single-view scenarios, leaving a gap in multi-view event data exploitation, particularly in challenges like information deficit and semantic misalignment.To bridge this gap, we introduce HyperMV, a multi-view event-based action recognition framework.HyperMV converts discrete event data into frame-like representations and extracts view-related features using a shared convolutional network.By treating segments as vertices and constructing hyperedges using rule-based and KNN-based strategies, a multi-view hypergraph neural network that captures relationships across viewpoint and temporal features is established.The vertex attention hypergraph propagation is also introduced for enhanced feature fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To prompt research in this area, we present the largest multi-view event-based action dataset $\text{THU}^{\text{MV-EACT}}\text{-50}$, comprising 50 actions from 6 viewpoints, which surpasses existing datasets by over tenfold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span>Experimental results show that HyperMV significantly outperforms baselines in both cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, and also exceeds the state-of-the-arts in frame-based multi-view action recognition.</p>

                  <p>There is evidence that the driving style of an autonomous vehicle is important to increase the acceptance and trust of the passengers.The driving situation has been found to have a significant influence on human driving behavior.However, current driving style models only partially incorporate driving environment information, limiting the alignment between an agent and the given situation.Therefore, we propose a situation-aware driving style model based on different visual feature encoders pretrained on fleet data, as well as driving behavior predictors, which are adapted to the driving style of a specific driver.Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms static driving styles significantly and forms plausible situation clusters.Furthermore, we found that feature encoders pretrained on our dataset lead to more precise driving behavior modeling.In contrast, feature encoders pretrained supervised and unsupervised on different data sources lead to more specific situation clusters, which can be utilized to constrain and control the driving style adaptation for specific situations.Moreover, in a real-world setting, where driving style adaptation is happening iteratively, we found the MLP-based behavior predictors achieve good performance initially but suffer from catastrophic forgetting.In contrast, behavior predictors based on situationdependent statistics can learn iteratively from continuous data streams by design.Overall, our experiments show that important information for driving behavior prediction is contained within the visual feature encoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/jHaselberger/SADC-Situation-Awareness-for-Driver-Centric-Driving-Style-Adaptation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predictions of opaque black-box systems are frequently deployed in high-stakes applications such as healthcare.For such applications, it is crucial to assess how models handle samples beyond the domain of training data.While several metrics and tests exist to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) data from in-distribution (InD) data to a deep neural network (DNN), their performance varies significantly across datasets, models, and tasks, which limits their practical use.In this paper, we propose a hypothesis-driven approach to quantify whether a new sample is InD or OoD.Given a trained DNN and some input, we first feed the input through the DNN and compute an ensemble of OoD metrics, which we term latent responses.We then formulate the OoD detection problem as a hypothesis test between latent responses of different groups, and use permutation-based resampling to infer the significance of the observed latent responses under a null hypothesis.We adapt our method to detect an unseen sample of bacteria to a trained deep learning model, and show that it reveals interpretable differences between InD and OoD latent responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work has implications for systematic novelty detection and informed decision-making from classifiers trained on a subset of labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in learning semantic category discrimination.Despite the remarkable performance of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to the well-annotated data.However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the multimodal scenario.In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges -- enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and \emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval.First, we propose a semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend different modalities and provide precise transport cost.Second, to narrow the discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching.Both of these two components leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate effective cost function.The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.</p>

                  <p>Monocular 3D object detection has attracted widespread attention due to its potential to accurately obtain object 3D localization from a single image at a low cost.Depth estimation is an essential but challenging subtask of monocular 3D object detection due to the ill-posedness of 2D to 3D mapping.Many methods explore multiple local depth clues such as object heights and keypoints and then formulate the object depth estimation as an ensemble of multiple depth predictions to mitigate the insufficiency of single-depth information.However, the errors of existing multiple depths tend to have the same sign, which hinders them from neutralizing each other and limits the overall accuracy of combined depth.To alleviate this problem, we propose to increase the complementarity of depths with two novel designs.First, we add a new depth prediction branch named complementary depth that utilizes global and efficient depth clues from the entire image rather than the local clues to reduce the correlation of depth predictions.Second, we propose to fully exploit the geometric relations between multiple depth clues to achieve complementarity in form.Benefiting from these designs, our method achieves higher complementarity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without introducing extra data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>In addition, complementary depth can also be a lightweight and plug-and-play module to boost multiple existing monocular 3d object detectors.Code is available at https://github.com/elvintanhust/MonoCD.</p>

                  <p>As machine learning (ML) permeates fields like healthcare, facial recognition, and blockchain, the need to protect sensitive data intensifies.Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows inference on encrypted data, preserving the privacy of both data and the ML model.However, it slows down non-secure inference by up to five magnitudes, with a root cause of replacing non-polynomial operators (ReLU and MaxPooling) with high-degree Polynomial Approximated Function (PAF).We propose SmartPAF, a framework to replace non-polynomial operators with low-degree PAF and then recover the accuracy of PAF-approximated model through four techniques: (1) Coefficient Tuning (CT) -- adjust PAF coefficients based on the input distributions before training, (2) Progressive Approximation (PA) -- progressively replace one non-polynomial operator at a time followed by a fine-tuning, (3) Alternate Training (AT) -- alternate the training between PAFs and other linear operators in the decoupled manner, and (4) Dynamic Scale (DS) / Static Scale (SS) -- dynamically scale PAF input value within (-1, 1) in training, and fix the scale as the running max value in FHE deployment.The synergistic effect of CT, PA, AT, and DS/SS enables SmartPAF to enhance the accuracy of the various models approximated by PAFs with various low degrees under multiple datasets.For ResNet-18 under ImageNet-1k, the Pareto-frontier spotted by SmartPAF in latency-accuracy tradeoff space achieves 1.42x ~<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>13.64x accuracy improvement and 6.79x ~ 14.9x speedup than prior works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>Further, SmartPAF enables a 14-degree PAF (f1^2 g_1^2) to achieve 7.81x speedup compared to the 27-degree PAF obtained by minimax approximation with the same 69.4% post-replacement accuracy.Our code is available at https://github.com/TorchFHE/SmartPAF.</p>

                  <p>In modern manufacturing, most of the product lines are conforming.Few products are nonconforming but with different defect types.The identification of defect types can help further root cause diagnosis of production lines.With the sensing development, continuous signals of process variables can be collected in high resolution, which can be regarded as multichannel functional data.They have abundant information to characterize the process and help identify the defect types.Motivated by a real example from the pipe tightening process, we target at detect classification when each sample is a multichannel functional data.However, the available samples for each defect type are limited and imbalanced.Moreover, the functions are partially observed since the pre-tightening process before the pipe tightening process is unobserved.To classify the defect samples based on imbalanced, multichannel, and partially observed functional data is very important but challenging.Thus, we propose an innovative framework known as "Multichannel Partially Observed Functional Modeling for Defect Classification with an Imbalanced Dataset" (MPOFI).The framework leverages the power of deep metric learning in conjunction with a neural network specially crafted for processing functional data.This paper introduces a neural network explicitly tailored for handling multichannel and partially observed functional data, complemented by developing a corresponding loss function for training on imbalanced datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results from a real-world case study demonstrate the superior accuracy of our framework when compared to existing benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this thesis, we aim to improve the performance of TAMP algorithms from three complementary perspectives.First, we investigate the integration of discrete task planning with continuous trajectory optimization.Our main contribution is a conflict-based solver that automatically discovers why a task plan might fail when considering the constraints of the physical world.This information is then fed back into the task planner, resulting in an efficient, bidirectional, and intuitive interface between task and motion, capable of solving TAMP problems with multiple objects, robots, and tight physical constraints.In the second part, we first illustrate that, given the wide range of tasks and environments within TAMP, neither sampling nor optimization is superior in all settings.To combine the strengths of both approaches, we have designed meta-solvers for TAMP, adaptive solvers that automatically select which algorithms and computations to use and how to best decompose each problem to find a solution faster.In the third part, we combine deep learning architectures with model-based reasoning to accelerate computations within our TAMP solver.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we target infeasibility detection and nonlinear optimization, focusing on generalization, accuracy, compute time, and data efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>At the core of our contributions is a refined, factored representation of the trajectory optimization problems inside TAMP.This structure not only facilitates more efficient planning, encoding of geometric infeasibility, and meta-reasoning but also provides better generalization in neural architectures.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of 3D acquisition technology has made it possible to obtain point clouds of real-world terrains.However, due to limitations in sensor acquisition technology or specific requirements, point clouds often contain defects such as holes with missing data.Inpainting algorithms are widely used to patch these holes.However, existing traditional inpainting algorithms rely on precise hole boundaries, which limits their ability to handle cases where the boundaries are not well-defined.On the other hand, learning-based completion methods often prioritize reconstructing the entire point cloud instead of solely focusing on hole filling.Based on the fact that real-world terrain exhibits both global smoothness and rich local detail, we propose a novel representation for terrain point clouds.This representation can help to repair the holes without clear boundaries.Specifically, it decomposes terrains into low-frequency and high-frequency components, which are represented by B-spline surfaces and relative height maps respectively.In this way, the terrain point cloud inpainting problem is transformed into a B-spline surface fitting and 2D image inpainting problem.By solving the two problems, the highly complex and irregular holes on the terrain point clouds can be well-filled, which not only satisfies the global terrain undulation but also exhibits rich geometric details.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern learning frameworks often train deep neural networks with massive amounts of unlabeled data to learn representations by solving simple pretext tasks, then use the representations as foundations for downstream tasks.These networks are empirically designed; as such, they are usually not interpretable, their representations are not structured, and their designs are potentially redundant.White-box deep networks, in which each layer explicitly identifies and transforms structures in the data, present a promising alternative.However, existing white-box architectures have only been shown to work at scale in supervised settings with labeled data, such as classification.In this work, we provide the first instantiation of the white-box design paradigm that can be applied to large-scale unsupervised representation learning.We do this by exploiting a fundamental connection between diffusion, compression, and (masked) completion, deriving a deep transformer-like masked autoencoder architecture, called CRATE-MAE, in which the role of each layer is mathematically fully interpretable: they transform the data distribution to and from a structured representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our analytical insights. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>CRATE-MAE demonstrates highly promising performance on large-scale imagery datasets while using only ~30% of the parameters compared to the standard masked autoencoder with the same model configuration.The representations learned by CRATE-MAE have explicit structure and also contain semantic meaning.Code is available at https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/CRATE .</p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art neural rankers pre-trained on large task-specific training data such as MS-MARCO, have been shown to exhibit strong performance on various ranking tasks without domain adaptation, also called zero-shot.However, zero-shot neural ranking may be sub-optimal, as it does not take advantage of the target domain information.Unfortunately, acquiring sufficiently large and high quality target training data to improve a modern neural ranker can be costly and time-consuming.To address this problem, we propose a new approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for ranking, DUQGen, which addresses a critical gap in prior literature, namely how to automatically generate both effective and diverse synthetic training data to fine tune a modern neural ranker for a new domain.Specifically, DUQGen produces a more effective representation of the target domain by identifying clusters of similar documents; and generates a more diverse training dataset by probabilistic sampling over the resulting document clusters.Our extensive experiments, over the standard BEIR collection, demonstrate that DUQGen consistently outperforms all zero-shot baselines and substantially outperforms the SOTA baselines on 16 out of 18 datasets, for an average of 4% relative improvement across all datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We complement our results with a thorough analysis for more in-depth understanding of the proposed method's performance and to identify promising areas for further improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span></p>

                  <p>To mitigate forgetting, existing lifelong event detection methods typically maintain a memory module and replay the stored memory data during the learning of a new task.However, the simple combination of memory data and new-task samples can still result in substantial forgetting of previously acquired knowledge, which may occur due to the potential overlap between the feature distribution of new data and the previously learned embedding space.Moreover, the model suffers from overfitting on the few memory samples rather than effectively remembering learned patterns.To address the challenges of forgetting and overfitting, we propose a novel method based on embedding space separation and compaction.Our method alleviates forgetting of previously learned tasks by forcing the feature distribution of new data away from the previous embedding space.It also mitigates overfitting by a memory calibration mechanism that encourages memory data to be close to its prototype to enhance intra-class compactness.In addition, the learnable parameters of the new task are initialized by drawing upon acquired knowledge from the previously learned task to facilitate forward knowledge transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous Graphs (HGs) can effectively model complex relationships in the real world by multi-type nodes and edges.In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning, contrastive Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential by utilizing data augmentation and discriminators for downstream tasks.However, data augmentation is still limited due to the discrete and abstract nature of graphs.To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel \textit{Generative-Contrastive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GC-HGNN)}.Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning enhanced contrastive paradigm.This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy by using masked autoencoder.2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generate hard negative samples.3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy for capturing local and global information.Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Our model outperforms the latest contrastive and generative baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks.To reproduce our work, we have open-sourced our code at https://github.com/xxx.</p>

                  <p>The study of operator learning involves the utilization of neural networks to approximate operators.Traditionally, the focus has been on single-operator learning (SOL).However, recent advances have rapidly expanded this to include the approximation of multiple operators using foundation models equipped with millions or billions of trainable parameters, leading to the research of multi-operator learning (MOL).In this paper, we present a novel distributed training approach aimed at enabling a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges, all without incurring additional average costs.Our method is applicable to various Chen-Chen-type neural operators, such as Deep Operator Neural Networks (DON).The core idea is to independently learn the output basis functions for each operator using its dedicated data, while simultaneously centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset.Through a systematic study of five numerical examples, we compare the accuracy and cost of training a single neural operator for each operator independently versus training a MOL model using our proposed method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span>Moreover, our approach illustrates that some operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning.This highlights another MOL's potential to bolster operator learning.</p>

                  <p>Machine unlearning strives to uphold the data owners' right to be forgotten by enabling models to selectively forget specific data.Recent methods suggest that one approach of data forgetting is by precomputing and storing statistics carrying second-order information to improve computational and memory efficiency.However, they rely on restrictive assumptions and the computation/storage suffer from the curse of model parameter dimensionality, making it challenging to apply to most deep neural networks.In this work, we propose a Hessian-free online unlearning method.We propose to maintain a statistical vector for each data point, computed through affine stochastic recursion approximation of the difference between retrained and learned models.Our proposed algorithm achieves near-instantaneous online unlearning as it only requires a vector addition operation.Based on the strategy that recollecting statistics for forgetting data, the proposed method significantly reduces the unlearning runtime.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time and memory costs, while also enhancing accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Conditional sound separation in multi-source audio mixtures without having access to single source sound data during training is a long standing challenge.Existing mix-and-separate based methods suffer from significant performance drop with multi-source training mixtures due to the lack of supervision signal for single source separation cases during training.However, in the case of language-conditional audio separation, we do have access to corresponding text descriptions for each audio mixture in our training data, which can be seen as (rough) representations of the audio samples in the language modality.To this end, in this paper, we propose a generic bi-modal separation framework which can enhance the existing unsupervised frameworks to separate single-source signals in a target modality (i.e., audio) using the easily separable corresponding signals in the conditioning modality (i.e., language), without having access to single-source samples in the target modality during training.We empirically show that this is well within reach if we have access to a pretrained joint embedding model between the two modalities (i.e., CLAP).Furthermore, we propose to incorporate our framework into two fundamental scenarios to enhance separation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we show that our proposed methodology significantly improves the performance of purely unsupervised baselines by reducing the distribution shift between training and test samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>In particular, we show that our framework can achieve 71% boost in terms of Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) over the baseline, reaching 97.5% of the supervised learning performance.Second, we show that we can further improve the performance of the supervised learning itself by 17% if we augment it by our proposed weakly-supervised framework, that enables a powerful semi-supervised framework for audio separation.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in named entity recognition (NER) have pushed the boundary of the task to incorporate visual signals, leading to many variants, including multi-modal NER (MNER) or grounded MNER (GMNER).A key challenge to these tasks is that the model should be able to generalize to the entities unseen during the training, and should be able to handle the training samples with noisy annotations.To address this obstacle, we propose SCANNER (Span CANdidate detection and recognition for NER), a model capable of effectively handling all three NER variants.SCANNER is a two-stage structure; we extract entity candidates in the first stage and use it as a query to get knowledge, effectively pulling knowledge from various sources.We can boost our performance by utilizing this entity-centric extracted knowledge to address unseen entities.Furthermore, to tackle the challenges arising from noisy annotations in NER datasets, we introduce a novel self-distillation method, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our model in processing training data with inherent uncertainties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on the NER benchmark and surpasses existing methods on both MNER and GMNER benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Further analysis shows that the proposed distillation and knowledge utilization methods improve the performance of our model on various benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a promising task to train high-performance small models to enhance actual deployment without relying on the original training data.Existing methods commonly avoid relying on private data by utilizing synthetic or sampled data.However, a long-overlooked issue is that the severe distribution shifts between their substitution and original data, which manifests as huge differences in the quality of images and class proportions.The harmful shifts are essentially the confounder that significantly causes performance bottlenecks.To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a novel perspective with causal inference to disentangle the student models from the impact of such shifts.By designing a customized causal graph, we first reveal the causalities among the variables in the DFKD task.Subsequently, we propose a Knowledge Distillation Causal Intervention (KDCI) framework based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder.KDCI can be flexibly combined with most existing state-of-the-art baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments in combination with six representative DFKD methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDCI, which can obviously help existing methods under almost all settings, \textit{e.g.}, improving the baseline by up to 15.54\% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span></p>

                  <p>Building on the momentum of image generation diffusion models, there is an increasing interest in video-based diffusion models.However, video generation poses greater challenges due to its higher-dimensional nature, the scarcity of training data, and the complex spatiotemporal relationships involved.Image generation models, due to their extensive data requirements, have already strained computational resources to their limits.There have been instances of these models reproducing elements from the training samples, leading to concerns and even legal disputes over sample replication.Video diffusion models, which operate with even more constrained datasets and are tasked with generating both spatial and temporal content, may be more prone to replicating samples from their training sets.Compounding the issue, these models are often evaluated using metrics that inadvertently reward replication.In our paper, we present a systematic investigation into the phenomenon of sample replication in video diffusion models.We scrutinize various recent diffusion models for video synthesis, assessing their tendency to replicate spatial and temporal content in both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study identifies strategies that are less likely to lead to replication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Furthermore, we propose new evaluation strategies that take replication into account, offering a more accurate measure of a model's ability to generate the original content.</p>

                  <p>Remote sensing image classification forms the foundation of various understanding tasks, serving a crucial function in remote sensing image interpretation.The recent advancements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have markedly enhanced classification accuracy.Nonetheless, remote sensing scene classification remains a significant challenge, especially given the complexity and diversity of remote sensing scenarios and the variability of spatiotemporal resolutions.The capacity for whole-image understanding can provide more precise semantic cues for scene discrimination.In this paper, we introduce RSMamba, a novel architecture for remote sensing image classification.RSMamba is based on the State Space Model (SSM) and incorporates an efficient, hardware-aware design known as the Mamba.It integrates the advantages of both a global receptive field and linear modeling complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome the limitation of the vanilla Mamba, which can only model causal sequences and is not adaptable to two-dimensional image data, we propose a dynamic multi-path activation mechanism to augment Mamba's capacity to model non-causal data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.586</span></span>Notably, RSMamba maintains the inherent modeling mechanism of the vanilla Mamba, yet exhibits superior performance across multiple remote sensing image classification datasets.This indicates that RSMamba holds significant potential to function as the backbone of future visual foundation models.The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/KyanChen/RSMamba}.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural network models have demonstrated their effectiveness in classifying multi-label data from various domains.Typically, they employ a training mode that combines mini-batches with optimizers, where each sample is randomly selected with equal probability when constructing mini-batches.However, the intrinsic class imbalance in multi-label data may bias the model towards majority labels, since samples relevant to minority labels may be underrepresented in each mini-batch.Meanwhile, during the training process, we observe that instances associated with minority labels tend to induce greater losses.Existing heuristic batch selection methods, such as priority selection of samples with high contribution to the objective function, i.e., samples with high loss, have been proven to accelerate convergence while reducing the loss and test error in single-label data.However, batch selection methods have not yet been applied and validated in multi-label data.In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective adaptive batch selection algorithm tailored to multi-label deep learning models.It adaptively selects each batch by prioritizing hard samples related to minority labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A variant of our method also takes informative label correlations into consideration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Comprehensive experiments combining five multi-label deep learning models on thirteen benchmark datasets show that our method converges faster and performs better than random batch selection.</p>

                  <p>Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image processing.These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry.However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many challenges have emerged.This thesis presents various approaches that address robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.   Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before certification and deployment in practice.Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the adversarial attack literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, building trust in AI-based models requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that are more explainable and interpretable a priori.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and explainability.Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in the related research.Besides methodological developments for robust and explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and improving their design and robustness.In addition to the theoretical developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.</p>

                  <p>Recent researches have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to a security threat known as Backdoor Attack.The backdoored model will behave well in normal cases but exhibit malicious behaviours on inputs inserted with a specific backdoor trigger.Current backdoor studies on LLMs predominantly focus on instruction-tuned LLMs, while neglecting another realistic scenario where LLMs are fine-tuned on multi-turn conversational data to be chat models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Chat models are extensively adopted across various real-world scenarios, thus the security of chat models deserves increasing attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Unfortunately, we point out that the flexible multi-turn interaction format instead increases the flexibility of trigger designs and amplifies the vulnerability of chat models to backdoor attacks.In this work, we reveal and achieve a novel backdoor attacking method on chat models by distributing multiple trigger scenarios across user inputs in different rounds, and making the backdoor be triggered only when all trigger scenarios have appeared in the historical conversations.Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (e.g., over 90% ASR on Vicuna-7B) while successfully maintaining the normal capabilities of chat models on providing helpful responses to benign user requests.Also, the backdoor can not be easily removed by the downstream re-alignment, highlighting the importance of continued research and attention to the security concerns of chat models.Warning:This paper may contain toxic content.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for code has primarily relied on static benchmarks, including HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), which measure the ability of LLMs to generate complete code that passes unit tests.As LLMs are increasingly used as programmer assistants, we study whether gains on existing benchmarks translate to gains in programmer productivity when coding with LLMs, including time spent coding.In addition to static benchmarks, we investigate the utility of preference metrics that might be used as proxies to measure LLM helpfulness, such as code acceptance or copy rates.To do so, we introduce RealHumanEval, a web interface to measure the ability of LLMs to assist programmers, through either autocomplete or chat support.We conducted a user study (N=213) using RealHumanEval in which users interacted with six LLMs of varying base model performance.Despite static benchmarks not incorporating humans-in-the-loop, we find that improvements in benchmark performance lead to increased programmer productivity; however gaps in benchmark versus human performance are not proportional -- a trend that holds across both forms of LLM support.In contrast, we find that programmer preferences do not correlate with their actual performance, motivating the need for better, human-centric proxy signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also open-source RealHumanEval to enable human-centric evaluation of new models and the study data to facilitate efforts to improve code models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span></p>

                  <p>The risen complexity of automotive systems requires new development strategies and methods to master the upcoming challenges.Traditional methods need thus to be changed by an increased level of automation, and a faster continuous improvement cycle.In this context, current vehicle performance tests represent a very time-consuming and expensive task due to the need to perform the tests in real driving conditions.As a consequence, agile/iterative processes like DevOps are largely hindered by the necessity of triggering frequent tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper reports on a practical experience of developing an AI-augmented solution based on Machine Learning and Model-based Engineering to support continuous vehicle development and testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>In particular, historical data collected in real driving conditions is leveraged to synthesize a high-fidelity driving simulator and hence enable performance tests in virtual environments.Based on this practical experience, this paper also proposes a conceptual framework to support predictions based on real driving behavior.</p>
