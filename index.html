                  <p>Speech language models have recently demonstrated great potential as universal speech processing systems.Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc.Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking.To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response.The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text.We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones.This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models.We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are publicly available at https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel framework for converting 2D videos to immersive stereoscopic 3D, addressing the growing demand for 3D content in immersive experience.Leveraging foundation models as priors, our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods and boosts the performance to ensure the high-fidelity generation required by the display devices.The proposed system consists of two main steps: depth-based video splatting for warping and extracting occlusion mask, and stereo video inpainting.We utilize pre-trained stable video diffusion as the backbone and introduce a fine-tuning protocol for the stereo video inpainting task.To handle input video with varying lengths and resolutions, we explore auto-regressive strategies and tiled processing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, a sophisticated data processing pipeline has been developed to reconstruct a large-scale and high-quality dataset to support our training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>Our framework demonstrates significant improvements in 2D-to-3D video conversion, offering a practical solution for creating immersive content for 3D devices like Apple Vision Pro and 3D displays.In summary, this work contributes to the field by presenting an effective method for generating high-quality stereoscopic videos from monocular input, potentially transforming how we experience digital media.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance.However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization.This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques.We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior.Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications.Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.</p>

                  <p>Accurate prediction of house price, a vital aspect of the residential real estate sector, is of substantial interest for a wide range of stakeholders.However, predicting house prices is a complex task due to the significant variability influenced by factors such as house features, location, neighborhood, and many others.Despite numerous attempts utilizing a wide array of algorithms, including recent deep learning techniques, to predict house prices accurately, existing approaches have fallen short of considering a wide range of factors such as textual and visual features.This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively incorporating attributes, such as features, textual descriptions, geo-spatial neighborhood, and house images, typically showcased in real estate listings in a house price prediction system.Specifically, we propose a multi-modal deep learning approach that leverages different types of data to learn more accurate representation of the house.In particular, we learn a joint embedding of raw house attributes, geo-spatial neighborhood, and most importantly from textual description and images representing the house; and finally use a downstream regression model to predict the house price from this jointly learned embedding vector.Our experimental results with a real-world dataset show that the text embedding of the house advertisement description and image embedding of the house pictures in addition to raw attributes and geo-spatial embedding, can significantly improve the house price prediction accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The relevant source code and dataset are publicly accessible at the following URL: https://github.com/4P0N/mhpp <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span></p>

                  <p>Achieving 3D understanding of non-Lambertian objects is an important task with many useful applications, but most existing algorithms struggle to deal with such objects.One major obstacle towards progress in this field is the lack of holistic non-Lambertian benchmarks -- most benchmarks have low scene and object diversity, and none provide multi-layer 3D annotations for objects occluded by transparent surfaces.In this paper, we introduce LayeredFlow, a real world benchmark containing multi-layer ground truth annotation for optical flow of non-Lambertian objects.Compared to previous benchmarks, our benchmark exhibits greater scene and object diversity, with 150k high quality optical flow and stereo pairs taken over 185 indoor and outdoor scenes and 360 unique objects.Using LayeredFlow as evaluation data, we propose a new task called multi-layer optical flow.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To provide training data for this task, we introduce a large-scale densely-annotated synthetic dataset containing 60k images within 30 scenes tailored for non-Lambertian objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span>Training on our synthetic dataset enables model to predict multi-layer optical flow, while fine-tuning existing optical flow methods on the dataset notably boosts their performance on non-Lambertian objects without compromising the performance on diffuse objects.Data is available at https://layeredflow.cs.princeton.edu.</p>

                  <p>Aerial scene understanding systems face stringent payload restrictions and must often rely on monocular depth estimation for modelling scene geometry, which is an inherently ill-posed problem.Moreover, obtaining accurate ground truth data required by learning-based methods raises significant additional challenges in the aerial domain.Self-supervised approaches can bypass this problem, at the cost of providing only up-to-scale results.Similarly, recent supervised solutions which make good progress towards zero-shot generalization also provide only relative depth values.This work presents TanDepth, a practical, online scale recovery method for obtaining metric depth results from relative estimations at inference-time, irrespective of the type of model generating them.Tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, our method leverages sparse measurements from Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEM) by projecting them to the camera view using extrinsic and intrinsic information.An adaptation to the Cloth Simulation Filter is presented, which allows selecting ground points from the estimated depth map to then correlate with the projected reference points.We evaluate and compare our method against alternate scaling methods adapted for UAVs, on a variety of real-world scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Considering the limited availability of data for this domain, we construct and release a comprehensive, depth-focused extension to the popular UAVid dataset to further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.893</span></span></p>

                  <p>Partially-supervised multi-organ medical image segmentation aims to develop a unified semantic segmentation model by utilizing multiple partially-labeled datasets, with each dataset providing labels for a single class of organs.However, the limited availability of labeled foreground organs and the absence of supervision to distinguish unlabeled foreground organs from the background pose a significant challenge, which leads to a distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled pixels.Although existing pseudo-labeling methods can be employed to learn from both labeled and unlabeled pixels, they are prone to performance degradation in this task, as they rely on the assumption that labeled and unlabeled pixels have the same distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, to address the problem of distribution mismatch, we propose a labeled-to-unlabeled distribution alignment (LTUDA) framework that aligns feature distributions and enhances discriminative capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Specifically, we introduce a cross-set data augmentation strategy, which performs region-level mixing between labeled and unlabeled organs to reduce distribution discrepancy and enrich the training set.Besides, we propose a prototype-based distribution alignment method that implicitly reduces intra-class variation and increases the separation between the unlabeled foreground and background.This can be achieved by encouraging consistency between the outputs of two prototype classifiers and a linear classifier.Extensive experimental results on the AbdomenCT-1K dataset and a union of four benchmark datasets (including LiTS, MSD-Spleen, KiTS, and NIH82) demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art partially-supervised methods by a considerable margin, and even surpasses the fully-supervised methods.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/xjiangmed/LTUDA.</p>

                  <p>Seams are information-rich components of garments.The presence of different types of seams and their combinations helps to select grasping points for garment handling.In this paper, we propose a new Seam-Informed Strategy (SIS) for finding actions for handling a garment, such as grasping and unfolding a T-shirt.Candidates for a pair of grasping points for a dual-arm manipulator system are extracted using the proposed Seam Feature Extraction Method (SFEM).A pair of grasping points for the robot system is selected by the proposed Decision Matrix Iteration Method (DMIM).The decision matrix is first computed by multiple human demonstrations and updated by the robot execution results to improve the grasping and unfolding performance of the robot.Note that the proposed scheme is trained on real data without relying on simulation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>The project video is available at https://github.com/lancexz/sis.</p>

                  <p>As networks continue to increase in size, current methods must be capable of handling large numbers of nodes and edges in order to be practically relevant.Instead of working directly with the entire (large) network, analyzing sub-networks has become a popular approach.Due to a network's inherent inter-connectedness, sub-sampling is not a trivial task.While this problem has gained attention in recent years, it has not received sufficient attention from the statistics community.In this work, we provide a thorough comparison of seven graph sub-sampling algorithms by applying them to divide-and-conquer algorithms for community structure and core-periphery (CP) structure.After discussing the various algorithms and sub-sampling routines, we derive theoretical results for the mis-classification rate of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for CP structure under various sub-sampling schemes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then perform extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data to compare the various methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>For the community detection task, we found that sampling nodes uniformly at random yields the best performance.For CP structure on the other hand, there was no single winner, but algorithms which sampled core nodes at a higher rate consistently outperformed other sampling routines, e.g., random edge sampling and random walk sampling.The varying performance of the sampling algorithms on different tasks demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting a sub-sampling routine for the specific application.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) coordinates multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy.However, large memory footprint and high energy consumption during the training process excludes the low-end devices from contributing to the global model with their own data, which severely deteriorates the model performance in real-world scenarios.In this paper, we propose FedStitch, a hierarchical coordination framework for heterogeneous federated learning with pre-trained blocks.Unlike the traditional approaches that train the global model from scratch, for a new task, FedStitch composes the global model via stitching pre-trained blocks.Specifically, each participating client selects the most suitable block based on their local data from the candidate pool composed of blocks from pre-trained models.The server then aggregates the optimal block for stitching.This process iterates until a new stitched network is generated.Except for the new training paradigm, FedStitch consists of the following three core components: 1) an RL-weighted aggregator, 2) a search space optimizer deployed on the server side, and 3) a local energy optimizer deployed on each participating client.The RL-weighted aggregator helps to select the right block in the non-IID scenario, while the search space optimizer continuously reduces the size of the candidate block pool during stitching.Meanwhile, the local energy optimizer is designed to minimize energy consumption of each client while guaranteeing the overall training progress.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, FedStitch improves the model accuracy up to 20.93%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>At the same time, it achieves up to 8.12% speedup, reduces the memory footprint up to 79.5%, and achieves 89.41% energy saving at most during the learning procedure.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning plays a critical role in vision-based satellite pose estimation.However, the scarcity of real data from the space environment means that deep models need to be trained using synthetic data, which raises the Sim2Real domain gap problem.A major cause of the Sim2Real gap are novel lighting conditions encountered during test time.Event sensors have been shown to provide some robustness against lighting variations in vision-based pose estimation.However, challenging lighting conditions due to strong directional light can still cause undesirable effects in the output of commercial off-the-shelf event sensors, such as noisy/spurious events and inhomogeneous event densities on the object.Such effects are non-trivial to simulate in software, thus leading to Sim2Real gap in the event domain.To close the Sim2Real gap in event-based satellite pose estimation, the paper proposes a test-time self-supervision scheme with a certifier module.Self-supervision is enabled by an optimisation routine that aligns a dense point cloud of the predicted satellite pose with the event data to attempt to rectify the inaccurately estimated pose.The certifier attempts to verify the corrected pose, and only certified test-time inputs are backpropagated via implicit differentiation to refine the predicted landmarks, thus improving the pose estimates and closing the Sim2Real gap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that the our method outperforms established test-time adaptation schemes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>In computer-aided diagnosis tools employed for skin cancer treatment and early diagnosis, skin lesion segmentation is important.However, achieving precise segmentation is challenging due to inherent variations in appearance, contrast, texture, and blurry lesion boundaries.This research presents a robust approach utilizing a dilated convolutional residual network, which incorporates an attention-based spatial feature enhancement block (ASFEB) and employs a guided decoder strategy.In each dilated convolutional residual block, dilated convolution is employed to broaden the receptive field with varying dilation rates.To improve the spatial feature information of the encoder, we employed an attention-based spatial feature enhancement block in the skip connections.The ASFEB in our proposed method combines feature maps obtained from average and maximum-pooling operations.These combined features are then weighted using the active outcome of global average pooling and convolution operations.Additionally, we have incorporated a guided decoder strategy, where each decoder block is optimized using an individual loss function to enhance the feature learning process in the proposed AD-Net.The proposed AD-Net presents a significant benefit by necessitating fewer model parameters compared to its peer methods.This reduction in parameters directly impacts the number of labeled data required for training, facilitating faster convergence during the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed AD-Net was evaluated using four public benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to verify the efficiency of the AD-Net. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The outcomes suggest that our method surpasses other cutting-edge methods in performance, even without the implementation of data augmentation strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Object Detection is a highly relevant computer vision problem with many applications such as robotics and autonomous driving.Continual Learning~(CL) considers a setting where a model incrementally learns new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge.This is particularly challenging since Deep Learning models tend to catastrophically forget old knowledge while training on new data.In particular, Continual Learning for Object Detection~(CLOD) poses additional difficulties compared to CL for Classification.In CLOD, images from previous tasks may contain unknown classes that could reappear labeled in future tasks.These missing annotations cause task interference issues for replay-based approaches.As a result, most works in the literature have focused on distillation-based approaches.However, these approaches are effective only when there is a strong overlap of classes across tasks.To address the issues of current methodologies, we propose a novel technique to solve CLOD called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD).Based on the replay method, our solution avoids task interference issues by enhancing the buffer memory samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method is evaluated against existing techniques in CLOD literature, demonstrating its superior performance on established benchmarks like VOC and COCO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous applications in environmental monitoring, cybersecurity, finance, and medicine to name a few.Being an inherently unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD (both algorithm and hyperparameter selection) without label supervision.There is a long list of techniques to choose from -- both classical algorithms and deep neural architectures -- and while several studies report their hyperparameter sensitivity, the literature is quite slim on unsupervised model selection -- limiting the effective use of OD in practice.In this paper we present FoMo-0D, for zero/0-shot OD exploring a transformative new direction that bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether (!), thus breaking new ground.The fundamental idea behind FoMo-0D is the Prior-data Fitted Networks, recently introduced by Muller et al.(2022), which trains a Transformer model on a large body of synthetically generated data from a prior data distribution.In essence, FoMo-0D is a pretrained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of any test data at inference time, by merely a single forward pass -- making obsolete the need for choosing an algorithm/architecture, tuning its associated hyperparameters, and even training any model parameters when given a new OD dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on 57 public benchmark datasets against 26 baseline methods show that FoMo-0D performs statistically no different from the top 2nd baseline, while significantly outperforming the majority of the baselines, with an average inference time of 7.7 ms per test sample. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized approach to model training, where data remains local and only model parameters are shared between the clients and the central server.Traditional methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), linearly aggregate these parameters which are usually trained on heterogeneous data distributions, potentially overlooking the complex, high-dimensional nature of the parameter space.This can result in degraded performance of the aggregated model.While personalized FL approaches can mitigate the heterogeneous data issue to some extent, the limitation of linear aggregation remains unresolved.To alleviate this issue, we investigate the generative approach of diffusion model and propose a novel generative parameter aggregation framework for personalized FL, \texttt{pFedGPA}.In this framework, we deploy a diffusion model on the server to integrate the diverse parameter distributions and propose a parameter inversion method to efficiently generate a set of personalized parameters for each client.This inversion method transforms the uploaded parameters into a latent code, which is then aggregated through denoising sampling to produce the final personalized parameters.By encoding the dependence of a client's model parameters on the specific data distribution using the high-capacity diffusion model, \texttt{pFedGPA} can effectively decouple the complexity of the overall distribution of all clients' model parameters from the complexity of each individual client's parameter distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across multiple datasets, surpassing baseline approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span></p>

                  <p>Distribution shifts between sites can seriously degrade model performance since models are prone to exploiting unstable correlations.Thus, many methods try to find features that are stable across sites and discard unstable features.However, unstable features might have complementary information that, if used appropriately, could increase accuracy.More recent methods try to adapt to unstable features at the new sites to achieve higher accuracy.However, they make unrealistic assumptions or fail to scale to multiple confounding features.We propose Generalized Prevalence Adjustment (GPA for short), a flexible method that adjusts model predictions to the shifting correlations between prediction target and confounders to safely exploit unstable features.GPA can infer the interaction between target and confounders in new sites using unlabeled samples from those sites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate GPA on several real and synthetic datasets, and show that it outperforms competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Precise and timely forecasting of blood glucose levels is essential for effective diabetes management.While extensive research has been conducted on Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneity, underscoring the need for specialized blood glucose forecasting systems.This study introduces a novel blood glucose forecasting system, applied to a dataset of 100 patients from the ShanghaiT2DM study.Our study uniquely integrates knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, leveraging expert knowledge to validate and interpret the relationships among diabetes-related variables and deploying the data-driven approach to provide accurate forecast blood glucose levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Bayesian network approach facilitates the analysis of dependencies among various diabetes-related variables, thus enabling the inference of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) trajectories in similar individuals with T2DM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>By incorporating past CGM data including inference CGM trajectories, dietary records, and individual-specific information, the Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model effectively forecasts glucose levels across time intervals ranging from 15 to 60 minutes.Forecast results show a mean absolute error of 6.41 mg/dL, a root mean square error of 8.29 mg/dL, and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.28%, for a 15-minute prediction horizon.This study makes the first application of the ShanghaiT2DM dataset for glucose level forecasting, considering the influences of diabetes-related variables.Its findings establish a foundational framework for developing personalized diabetes management strategies, potentially enhancing diabetes care through more accurate and timely interventions.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an effective method for exploiting unlabelled data to learn a high-level embedding space that can be used for various downstream tasks.However, existing methods to monitor the quality of the encoder -- either during training for one model or to compare several trained models -- still rely on access to annotated data.When SSL methodologies are applied to new data domains, a sufficiently large labelled dataset may not always be available.In this study, we propose several evaluation metrics which can be applied on the embeddings of unlabelled data and investigate their viability by comparing them to linear probe accuracy (a common metric which utilizes an annotated dataset).In particular, we apply $k$-means clustering and measure the clustering quality with the silhouette score and clustering agreement.We also measure the entropy of the embedding distribution.We find that while the clusters did correspond better to the ground truth annotations as training of the network progressed, label-free clustering metrics correlated with the linear probe accuracy only when training with SSL methods SimCLR and MoCo-v2, but not with SimSiam.Additionally, although entropy did not always have strong correlations with LP accuracy, this appears to be due to instability arising from early training, with the metric stabilizing and becoming more reliable at later stages of learning.Furthermore, while entropy generally decreases as learning progresses, this trend reverses for SimSiam.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More research is required to establish the cause for this unexpected behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Lastly, we find that while clustering based approaches are likely only viable for same-architecture comparisons, entropy may be architecture-independent.</p>

                  <p>Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks.Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive.We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.   The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination.The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination.We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models.Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.   We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models.Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training.On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours.Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), long-context information understanding and processing have become a hot topic in academia and industry.However, benchmarks for evaluating the ability of LLMs to handle long-context information do not seem to have kept pace with the development of LLMs.Despite the emergence of various long-context evaluation benchmarks, the types of capability assessed are still limited, without new capability dimensions.In this paper, we introduce DetectiveQA, a narrative reasoning benchmark featured with an average context length of over 100K tokens.DetectiveQA focuses on evaluating the long-context reasoning ability of LLMs, which not only requires a full understanding of context but also requires extracting important evidences from the context and reasoning according to extracted evidences to answer the given questions.This is a new dimension of capability evaluation, which is more in line with the current intelligence level of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use detective novels as data sources, which naturally have various reasoning elements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Finally, we manually annotated 600 questions in Chinese and then also provided an English edition of the context information and questions.We evaluate many long-context LLMs on DetectiveQA, including commercial and open-sourced models, and the results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process true long-context dependency questions.</p>

                  <p>Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices.This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength.For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment.Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.)for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks.To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community.We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

                  <p>The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems.Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency.In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models.To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct.WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities.WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs.Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels.This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome the inherent limitations of deep neural network training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/francescodisalvo05/wann-noisy-labels .</p>

                  <p>Modern listwise recommendation systems need to consider both long-term user perceptions and short-term interest shifts.Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency.Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation.Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem.We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively.To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment.Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and codes have been made public. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>
