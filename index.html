                  <p>With the rising prevalence of deepfakes, there is a growing interest in developing generalizable detection methods for various types of deepfakes.While effective in their specific modalities, traditional detection methods fall short in addressing the generalizability of detection across diverse cross-modal deepfakes.This paper aims to explicitly learn potential cross-modal correlation to enhance deepfake detection towards various generation scenarios.Our approach introduces a correlation distillation task, which models the inherent cross-modal correlation based on content information.This strategy helps to prevent the model from overfitting merely to audio-visual synchronization.Additionally, we present the Cross-Modal Deepfake Dataset (CMDFD), a comprehensive dataset with four generation methods to evaluate the detection of diverse cross-modal deepfakes.The experimental results on CMDFD and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superior generalizability of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data can be found at \url{https://github.com/ljj898/CMDFD-Dataset-and-Deepfake-Detection}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cued Speech (CS) is an advanced visual phonetic encoding system that integrates lip reading with hand codings, enabling people with hearing impairments to communicate efficiently.CS video generation aims to produce specific lip and gesture movements of CS from audio or text inputs.The main challenge is that given limited CS data, we strive to simultaneously generate fine-grained hand and finger movements, as well as lip movements, meanwhile the two kinds of movements need to be asynchronously aligned.Existing CS generation methods are fragile and prone to poor performance due to template-based statistical models and careful hand-crafted pre-processing to fit the models.Therefore, we propose a novel Gloss-prompted Diffusion-based CS Gesture generation framework (called GlossDiff).Specifically, to integrate additional linguistic rules knowledge into the model.we first introduce a bridging instruction called \textbf{Gloss}, which is an automatically generated descriptive text to establish a direct and more delicate semantic connection between spoken language and CS gestures.Moreover, we first suggest rhythm is an important paralinguistic feature for CS to improve the communication efficacy.Therefore, we propose a novel Audio-driven Rhythmic Module (ARM) to learn rhythm that matches audio speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, in this work, we design, record, and publish the first Chinese CS dataset with four CS cuers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.946</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.We release the code and data at https://glossdiff.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Approximate k-Nearest Neighbour (ANN) methods are often used for mining information and aiding machine learning on large scale high-dimensional datasets.ANN methods typically differ in the index structure used for accelerating searches, resulting in various recall/runtime trade-off points.For applications with static datasets, runtime constraints and dataset properties can be used to empirically select an ANN method with suitable operating characteristics.However, for applications with dynamic datasets, which are subject to frequent online changes (like addition of new samples), there is currently no consensus as to which ANN methods are most suitable.Traditional evaluation approaches do not consider the computational costs of updating the index structure, as well as the frequency and size of index updates.To address this, we empirically evaluate 5 popular ANN methods on two main applications (online data collection and online feature learning) while taking into account these considerations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two dynamic datasets are used, derived from the SIFT1M dataset with 1 million samples and the DEEP1B dataset with 1 billion samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>The results indicate that the often used k-d trees method is not suitable on dynamic datasets as it is slower than a straightforward baseline exhaustive search method.For online data collection, the Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs method achieves a consistent speedup over baseline across a wide range of recall rates.For online feature learning, the Scalable Nearest Neighbours method is faster than baseline for recall rates below 75%.</p>

                  <p>Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to distinguish and track target objects in a video.Despite the excellent performance achieved by off-the-shell VOS models, existing VOS benchmarks mainly focus on short-term videos lasting about 5 seconds, where objects remain visible most of the time.However, these benchmarks poorly represent practical applications, and the absence of long-term datasets restricts further investigation of VOS in realistic scenarios.Thus, we propose a novel benchmark named LVOS, comprising 720 videos with 296,401 frames and 407,945 high-quality annotations.Videos in LVOS last 1.14 minutes on average, approximately 5 times longer than videos in existing datasets.Each video includes various attributes, especially challenges deriving from the wild, such as long-term reappearing and cross-temporal similar objects.Compared to previous benchmarks, our LVOS better reflects VOS models' performance in real scenarios.Based on LVOS, we evaluate 20 existing VOS models under 4 different settings and conduct a comprehensive analysis.On LVOS, these models suffer a large performance drop, highlighting the challenge of achieving precise tracking and segmentation in real-world scenarios.Attribute-based analysis indicates that key factor to accuracy decline is the increased video length, emphasizing LVOS's crucial role.We hope our LVOS can advance development of VOS in real scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are available at https://lingyihongfd.github.io/lvos.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>Working with cognate data involves handling synonyms, that is, multiple words that describe the same concept in a language.In the early days of language phylogenetics it was recommended to select one synonym only.However, as we show here, binary character matrices, which are used as input for computational methods, do allow for representing the entire dataset including all synonyms.Here we address the question how one can and if one should include all synonyms or whether it is preferable to select synonyms a priori.To this end, we perform maximum likelihood tree inferences with the widely used RAxML-NG tool and show that it yields plausible trees when all synonyms are used as input.Furthermore, we show that a priori synonym selection can yield topologically substantially different trees and we therefore advise against doing so.To represent cognate data including all synonyms, we introduce two types of character matrices beyond the standard binary ones: probabilistic binary and probabilistic multi-valued character matrices.We further show that it is dataset-dependent for which character matrix type the inferred RAxML-NG tree is topologically closest to the gold standard.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also make available a Python interface for generating all of the above character matrix types for cognate data provided in CLDF format. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promising results in learning a task-specific policy from a fixed dataset.However, successful offline RL often relies heavily on the coverage and quality of the given dataset.In scenarios where the dataset for a specific task is limited, a natural approach is to improve offline RL with datasets from other tasks, namely, to conduct Multi-Task Data Sharing (MTDS).Nevertheless, directly sharing datasets from other tasks exacerbates the distribution shift in offline RL.In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based MTDS approach that shares the entire dataset without data selection.Given ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, we perform pessimistic value iteration on the shared offline dataset, which provides a unified framework for single- and multi-task offline RL.We further provide theoretical analysis, which shows that the optimality gap of our method is only related to the expected data coverage of the shared dataset, thus resolving the distribution shift issue in data sharing.Empirically, we release an MTDS benchmark and collect datasets from three challenging domains.The experimental results show our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in challenging MTDS problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>See https://github.com/Baichenjia/UTDS for the datasets and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.935</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal machine translation (MMT) is a challenging task that seeks to improve translation quality by incorporating visual information.However, recent studies have indicated that the visual information provided by existing MMT datasets is insufficient, causing models to disregard it and overestimate their capabilities.This issue presents a significant obstacle to the development of MMT research.This paper presents a novel solution to this issue by introducing 3AM, an ambiguity-aware MMT dataset comprising 26,000 parallel sentence pairs in English and Chinese, each with corresponding images.Our dataset is specifically designed to include more ambiguity and a greater variety of both captions and images than other MMT datasets.We utilize a word sense disambiguation model to select ambiguous data from vision-and-language datasets, resulting in a more challenging dataset.We further benchmark several state-of-the-art MMT models on our proposed dataset.Experimental results show that MMT models trained on our dataset exhibit a greater ability to exploit visual information than those trained on other MMT datasets.Our work provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field of multimodal learning and encourages further exploration in this area.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data, code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/MaxyLee/3AM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on extensive, temporally indiscriminate text corpora, reflecting the lack of datasets with temporal metadata.This approach is not aligned with the evolving nature of language.Conventional methods for creating temporally adapted language models often depend on further pre-training static models on time-specific data.This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative.This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes.This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide access to both the models and training datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>The awareness of multi-cultural human values is critical to the ability of language models (LMs) to generate safe and personalized responses.However, this awareness of LMs has been insufficiently studied, since the computer science community lacks access to the large-scale real-world data about multi-cultural values.In this paper, we present WorldValuesBench, a globally diverse, large-scale benchmark dataset for the multi-cultural value prediction task, which requires a model to generate a rating response to a value question based on demographic contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is derived from an influential social science project, World Values Survey (WVS), that has collected answers to hundreds of value questions (e.g., social, economic, ethical) from 94,728 participants worldwide. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>We have constructed more than 20 million examples of the type "(demographic attributes, value question) $\rightarrow$ answer" from the WVS responses.We perform a case study using our dataset and show that the task is challenging for strong open and closed-source models.On merely $11.1\%$, $25.0\%$, $72.2\%$, and $75.0\%$ of the questions, Alpaca-7B, Vicuna-7B-v1.5, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, and GPT-3.5Turbo can respectively achieve $<0.2$ Wasserstein 1-distance from the human normalized answer distributions.WorldValuesBench opens up new research avenues in studying limitations and opportunities in multi-cultural value awareness of LMs.</p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt learning has become the most effective paradigm for adapting large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks.Recently, unsupervised prompt tuning methods, such as UPL and POUF, directly leverage pseudo-labels as supervisory information to fine-tune additional adaptation modules on unlabeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, inaccurate pseudo labels easily misguide the tuning process and result in poor representation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>In light of this, we propose Training-Free Unsupervised Prompts (TFUP), which maximally preserves the inherent representation capabilities and enhances them with a residual connection to similarity-based prediction probabilities in a training-free and labeling-free manner.Specifically, we integrate both instance confidence and prototype scores to select representative samples, which are used to customize a reliable Feature Cache Model (FCM) for training-free inference.Then, we design a Multi-level Similarity Measure (MSM) that considers both feature-level and semantic-level similarities to calculate the distance between each test image and the cached sample as the weight of the corresponding cached label to generate similarity-based prediction probabilities.In this way, TFUP achieves surprising performance, even surpassing the training-base method on multiple classification datasets.Based on our TFUP, we propose a training-based approach (TFUP-T) to further boost the adaptation performance.In addition to the standard cross-entropy loss, TFUP-T adopts an additional marginal distribution entropy loss to constrain the model from a global perspective.Our TFUP-T achieves new state-of-the-art classification performance compared to unsupervised and few-shot adaptation approaches on multiple benchmarks.In particular, TFUP-T improves the classification accuracy of POUF by 3.3% on the most challenging Domain-Net dataset.</p>

                  <p>Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target but usually requires simultaneous access to both source and target data.Moreover, UDA approaches commonly assume that source and target domains share the same labels space.Yet, these two assumptions are hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios.This paper considers the more challenging Source-Free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting, where both assumptions are dropped.We propose a novel approach for SF-OSDA that exploits the granularity of target-private categories by segregating their samples into multiple unknown classes.Starting from an initial clustering-based assignment, our method progressively improves the segregation of target-private samples by refining their pseudo-labels with the guide of an uncertainty-based sample selection module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive loss, named NL-InfoNCELoss, that, integrating negative learning into self-supervised contrastive learning, enhances the model robustness to noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.Notably, additional analyses show that our method is able to learn the underlying semantics of novel classes, opening the possibility to perform novel class discovery.</p>

                  <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile networks is regarded as one of the most important scenarios for 6G.In 6G, a major objective is to realize the efficient transmission of task-relevant data.Then a key problem arises, how to design collaborative AI models for the device side and the network side, so that the transmitted data between the device and the network is efficient enough, which means the transmission overhead is low but the AI task result is accurate.In this paper, we propose the multi-link information bottleneck (ML-IB) scheme for such collaborative models design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We formulate our problem based on a novel performance metric, which can evaluate both task accuracy and transmission overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Then we introduce a quantizer that is adjustable in the quantization bit depth, amplitudes, and breakpoints.Given the infeasibility of calculating our proposed metric on high-dimensional data, we establish a variational upper bound for this metric.However, due to the incorporation of quantization, the closed form of the variational upper bound remains uncomputable.Hence, we employ the Log-Sum Inequality to derive an approximation and provide a theoretical guarantee.Based on this, we devise the quantized multi-link information bottleneck (QML-IB) algorithm for collaborative AI models generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our QML-IB algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>Conformal prediction is a powerful tool to generate uncertainty sets with guaranteed coverage using any predictive model, under the assumption that the training and test data are i.i.d..Recently, it has been shown that adversarial examples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets with invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated.To address this issue, a recent work, Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP), was first proposed to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to adversarial noise.However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness guarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large uncertainty sets.To address these limitations, we first propose a novel framework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation, which fixes the issues in the original RSCP method.Next, we propose two novel methods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results in CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet suggest the baseline method only yields trivial predictions including full label set, while our methods could boost the efficiency by up to $4.36\times$, $5.46\times$, and $16.9\times$ respectively and provide practical robustness guarantee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Our codes are available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/Provably-Robust-Conformal-Prediction.</p>

                  <p>Speech-driven 3D facial animation technology has been developed for years, but its practical application still lacks expectations.The main challenges lie in data limitations, lip alignment, and the naturalness of facial expressions.Although lip alignment has seen many related studies, existing methods struggle to synthesize natural and realistic expressions, resulting in a mechanical and stiff appearance of facial animations.Even with some research extracting emotional features from speech, the randomness of facial movements limits the effective expression of emotions.To address this issue, this paper proposes a method called CSTalk (Correlation Supervised) that models the correlations among different regions of facial movements and supervises the training of the generative model to generate realistic expressions that conform to human facial motion patterns.To generate more intricate animations, we employ a rich set of control parameters based on the metahuman character model and capture a dataset for five different emotions.We train a generative network using an autoencoder structure and input an emotion embedding vector to achieve the generation of user-control expressions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span></p>

                  <p>The scarcity of labeled data in real-world scenarios is a critical bottleneck of deep learning's effectiveness.Semi-supervised semantic segmentation has been a typical solution to achieve a desirable tradeoff between annotation cost and segmentation performance.However, previous approaches, whether based on consistency regularization or self-training, tend to neglect the contextual knowledge embedded within inter-pixel relations.This negligence leads to suboptimal performance and limited generalization.In this paper, we propose a novel approach IPixMatch designed to mine the neglected but valuable Inter-Pixel information for semi-supervised learning.Specifically, IPixMatch is constructed as an extension of the standard teacher-student network, incorporating additional loss terms to capture inter-pixel relations.It shines in low-data regimes by efficiently leveraging the limited labeled data and extracting maximum utility from the available unlabeled data.Furthermore, IPixMatch can be integrated seamlessly into most teacher-student frameworks without the need of model modification or adding additional components.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our straightforward IPixMatch method demonstrates consistent performance improvements across various benchmark datasets under different partitioning protocols. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although RDBs store vast amounts of rich, informative data spread across interconnected tables, the progress of predictive machine learning models as applied to such tasks arguably falls well behind advances in other domains such as computer vision or natural language processing.This deficit stems, at least in part, from the lack of established/public RDB benchmarks as needed for training and evaluation purposes.As a result, related model development thus far often defaults to tabular approaches trained on ubiquitous single-table benchmarks, or on the relational side, graph-based alternatives such as GNNs applied to a completely different set of graph datasets devoid of tabular characteristics.To more precisely target RDBs lying at the nexus of these two complementary regimes, we explore a broad class of baseline models predicated on: (i) converting multi-table datasets into graphs using various strategies equipped with efficient subsampling, while preserving tabular characteristics; and (ii) trainable models with well-matched inductive biases that output predictions based on these input subgraphs.Then, to address the dearth of suitable public benchmarks and reduce siloed comparisons, we assemble a diverse collection of (i) large-scale RDB datasets and (ii) coincident predictive tasks.From a delivery standpoint, we operationalize the above four dimensions (4D) of exploration within a unified, scalable open-source toolbox called 4DBInfer.We conclude by presenting evaluations using 4DBInfer, the results of which highlight the importance of considering each such dimension in the design of RDB predictive models, as well as the limitations of more naive approaches such as simply joining adjacent tables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code is released at https://github.com/awslabs/multi-table-benchmark . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>Online social networks are ubiquitous parts of modern societies and the discussions that take place in these networks impact people's opinions on diverse topics, such as politics or vaccination.One of the most popular models to formally describe this opinion formation process is the Friedkin--Johnsen (FJ) model, which allows to define measures, such as the polarization and the disagreement of a network.Recently, Xu, Bao and Zhang (WebConf'21) showed that all opinions and relevant measures in the FJ model can be approximated in near-linear time.However, their algorithm requires the entire network and the opinions of all nodes as input.Given the sheer size of online social networks and increasing data-access limitations, obtaining the entirety of this data might, however, be unrealistic in practice.In this paper, we show that node opinions and all relevant measures, like polarization and disagreement, can be efficiently approximated in time that is sublinear in the size of the network.Particularly, our algorithms only require query-access to the network and do not have to preprocess the graph.Furthermore, we use a connection between FJ opinion dynamics and personalized PageRank, and show that in $d$-regular graphs, we can deterministically approximate each node's opinion by only looking at a constant-size neighborhood, independently of the network size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also experimentally validate that our estimation algorithms perform well in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ordinal regression is a specialized supervised problem where the labels show an inherent order.The order distinguishes it from normal multi-class problem.Support Vector Ordinal Regression, as an outstanding ordinal regression model, is widely used in many ordinal regression tasks.However, like most supervised learning algorithms, the design of SVOR is based on the assumption that the training data are real and reliable, which is difficult to satisfy in real-world data.In many practical applications, outliers are frequently present in the training set, potentially leading to misguide the learning process, such that the performance is non-optimal.In this paper, we propose a novel capped $\ell_{p}$-norm loss function that is theoretically robust to both light and heavy outliers.The capped $\ell_{p}$-norm loss can help the model detect and eliminate outliers during training process.Adhering to this concept, we introduce a new model, Capped $\ell_{p}$-Norm Support Vector Ordinal Regression(CSVOR), that is robust to outliers.CSVOR uses a weight matrix to detect and eliminate outliers during the training process to improve the robustness to outliers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a Re-Weighted algorithm algorithm which is illustrated convergence by our theoretical results is proposed to effectively minimize the corresponding problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods, particularly in the presence of outliers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series.These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance.However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets.The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples.Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations.In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task.Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning.We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models.We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series.We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches.</p>

                  <p>Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks.But, can they really "reason" over the natural language?This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied.However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored.Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic.Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics.To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule.We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting.Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, they sometimes overlook contextual information necessary for reasoning to arrive at the correct conclusion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs.Data and code are available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/LogicBench.</p>

                  <p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations.Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs.Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily.Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees.Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model.Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data.It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications.While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required.Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology.To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems.By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span></p>

Preventing energy attacks and ensuring the security of IoT infrastructure are key challenges in modern smart homes.Monitoring energy consumption can be an effective approach to detecting abnormal behavior and IoT cyberattacks.Lightweight algorithms are necessary to accommodate the resource limitations of IoT devices.   This paper presents a lightweight technique for detecting energy consumption attacks on smart home devices by analyzing received packets.The proposed algorithm considers TCP, UDP, and MQTT protocols, as well as device statuses (Idle, active, under attack).It accounts for resource constraints and promptly alerts administrators upon detecting an attack.The proposed approach effectively identifies energy consumption attacks by measuring packet reception rates for different protocols.</p>

Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>

We focus on group fairness notions and investigate the HP space of 5 training algorithms.We first find that tree regressors and XGBoots significantly outperformed deep neural networks and support vector machines in accurately predicting the fairness of HPs.When predicting the fairness of ML hyperparameters under temporal distribution shift, the tree regressors outperforms the other algorithms with reasonable accuracy.However, the precision depends on the ML training algorithm, dataset, and protected attributes.For example, the tree regressor model was robust for training data shift from 2014 to 2018 on logistic regression and discriminant analysis HPs with sex as the protected attribute; but not for race and other training algorithms.Our method provides a sound framework to efficiently perform fine-tuning of ML training algorithms and understand the relationships between HPs and fairness.</p>

                  <p>Incorporating the successful paradigm of pretraining and finetuning from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing into decision-making has become increasingly popular in recent years.In this paper, we study Imitation Learning from Observation with pretrained models and find existing approaches such as BCO and AIME face knowledge barriers, specifically the Embodiment Knowledge Barrier (EKB) and the Demonstration Knowledge Barrier (DKB), greatly limiting their performance.The EKB arises when pretrained models lack knowledge about unseen observations, leading to errors in action inference.The DKB results from policies trained on limited demonstrations, hindering adaptability to diverse scenarios.We thoroughly analyse the underlying mechanism of these barriers and propose AIME-v2 upon AIME as a solution.AIME-v2 uses online interactions with data-driven regulariser to alleviate the EKB and mitigates the DKB by introducing a surrogate reward function to enhance policy training.Experimental results on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of these modifications in improving both sample-efficiency and converged performance.The study contributes valuable insights into resolving knowledge barriers for enhanced decision-making in pretraining-based approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be available at https://github.com/argmax-ai/aime-v2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>
