                  <p>Learning and predicting the performance of given software configurations are of high importance to many software engineering activities.While configurable software systems will almost certainly face diverse running environments (e.g., version, hardware, and workload), current work often either builds performance models under a single environment or fails to properly handle data from diverse settings, hence restricting their accuracy for new environments.In this paper, we target configuration performance learning under multiple environments.We do so by designing SeMPL - a meta-learning framework that learns the common understanding from configurations measured in distinct (meta) environments and generalizes them to the unforeseen, target environment.What makes it unique is that unlike common meta-learning frameworks (e.g., MAML and MetaSGD) that train the meta environments in parallel, we train them sequentially, one at a time.The order of training naturally allows discriminating the contributions among meta environments in the meta-model built, which fits better with the characteristic of configuration data that is known to dramatically differ between different environments.Through comparing with 15 state-of-the-art models under nine systems, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SeMPL performs considerably better on 89% of the systems with up to 99% accuracy improvement, while being data-efficient, leading to a maximum of 3.86x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data can be found at our repository: https://github.com/ideas-labo/SeMPL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span></p>

                  <p>When comprehending code, a helping hand may come from the natural language comments documenting it that, unfortunately, are not always there.To support developers in such a scenario, several techniques have been presented to automatically generate natural language summaries for a given code.Most recent approaches exploit deep learning (DL) to automatically document classes or functions, while little effort has been devoted to more fine-grained documentation (e.g., documenting code snippets or even a single statement).Such a design choice is dictated by the availability of training data: For example, in the case of Java, it is easy to create datasets composed of pairs <Method, Javadoc> that can be fed to DL models to teach them how to summarize a method.Such a comment-to-code linking is instead non-trivial when it comes to inner comments documenting a few statements.In this work, we take all the steps needed to train a DL model to document code snippets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we manually built a dataset featuring 6.6k comments that have been (i) classified based on their type (e.g., code summary, TODO), and (ii) linked to the code statements they document. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>Second, we used such a dataset to train a multi-task DL model, taking as input a comment and being able to (i) classify whether it represents a "code summary" or not and (ii) link it to the code statements it documents.Our model identifies code summaries with 84% accuracy and is able to link them to the documented lines of code with recall and precision higher than 80%.Third, we run this model on 10k projects, identifying and linking code summaries to the documented code.This unlocked the possibility of building a large-scale dataset of documented code snippets that have then been used to train a new DL model able to document code snippets.A comparison with state-of-the-art baselines shows the superiority of the proposed approach.</p>

                  <p>Accurate obstacle identification represents a fundamental challenge within the scope of near-field perception for autonomous driving.Conventionally, fisheye cameras are frequently employed for comprehensive surround-view perception, including rear-view obstacle localization.However, the performance of such cameras can significantly deteriorate in low-light conditions, during nighttime, or when subjected to intense sun glare.Conversely, cost-effective sensors like ultrasonic sensors remain largely unaffected under these conditions.Therefore, we present, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end multimodal fusion model tailored for efficient obstacle perception in a bird's-eye-view (BEV) perspective, utilizing fisheye cameras and ultrasonic sensors.Initially, ResNeXt-50 is employed as a set of unimodal encoders to extract features specific to each modality.Subsequently, the feature space associated with the visible spectrum undergoes transformation into BEV.The fusion of these two modalities is facilitated via concatenation.At the same time, the ultrasonic spectrum-based unimodal feature maps pass through content-aware dilated convolution, applied to mitigate the sensor misalignment between two sensors in the fused feature space.Finally, the fused features are utilized by a two-stage semantic occupancy decoder to generate grid-wise predictions for precise obstacle perception.We conduct a systematic investigation to determine the optimal strategy for multimodal fusion of both sensors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide insights into our dataset creation procedures, annotation guidelines, and perform a thorough data analysis to ensure adequate coverage of all scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.924</span></span>When applied to our dataset, the experimental results underscore the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed multimodal fusion approach.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), especially Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, have significantly advanced in the industry in recent years.However, these models' broader development faces considerable challenges due to high operational and deployment costs.This has led to active research in improving the hardware efficiency of LLMs.Yet, the characteristics of real-world LLM workloads are often overlooked in current optimizations of LLM serving systems.In this work, we find that the absence of reliable workload data for evaluating LLM serving systems impacts the quality of service (QoS) and reliability in industrial deployments.This paper introduces the first real-world trace dataset of LLM serving workloads, detailing user, system, and LLM behaviors.We analyze this trace, highlighting burstiness, request and response distributions, and focusing on the reliability of GPT services.Based on this, we have developed a benchmark suite that reflects our dataset's workload patterns, enabling performance evaluation of serving systems.This suite captures the core patterns of workload distributions, allowing for precise scaling of the workload dataset to match system sizes.Our evaluation uncovers a previously unrecognized vulnerability of LLM serving systems to short-term burstiness, particularly in common workload scenarios.We observe that GPU memory limitations, caused by the fluctuating nature of burstiness, lead to significant performance degradation in existing LLM serving systems.Beyond benchmarking, understanding these patterns is valuable for optimizing LLM workload management, enabling elastic hardware resource adjustments to varying workloads.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the dataset and benchmark suite publicly available to encourage further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

                  <p>Extending large language models to effectively handle long contexts requires instruction fine-tuning on input sequences of similar length.To address this, we present LongAlign -- a recipe of the instruction data, training, and evaluation for long context alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we construct a long instruction-following dataset using Self-Instruct. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>To ensure the data diversity, it covers a broad range of tasks from various long context sources.Second, we adopt the packing and sorted batching strategies to speed up supervised fine-tuning on data with varied length distributions.Additionally, we develop a loss weighting method to balance the contribution to the loss across different sequences during packing training.Third, we introduce the LongBench-Chat benchmark for evaluating instruction-following capabilities on queries of 10k-100k in length.Experiments show that LongAlign outperforms existing recipes for LLMs in long context tasks by up to 30\%, while also maintaining their proficiency in handling short, generic tasks.The code, data, and long-aligned models are open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have advocated for fully open foundation models to promote transparency and open science.As an initial step, the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) reproduced OpenAI's Whisper using publicly available data and open-source toolkits.With the aim of reproducing Whisper, the previous OWSM v1 through v3 models were still based on Transformer, which might lead to inferior performance compared to other state-of-the-art speech encoders.In this work, we aim to improve the performance and efficiency of OWSM without extra training data.We present E-Branchformer based OWSM v3.1 models at two scales, i.e., 100M and 1B. The 1B model is the largest E-Branchformer based speech model that has been made publicly available.It outperforms the previous OWSM v3 in a vast majority of evaluation benchmarks, while demonstrating up to 25% faster inference speed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release the data preparation scripts, pre-trained models and training logs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been increasing concern about the vulnerability of deep neural network (DNN)-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) to adversarial attacks, where a DNN could be easily deceived by clean input with imperceptible but aggressive perturbations.This paper studies the synthetic-to-measured (S2M) transfer setting, where an attacker generates adversarial perturbation based solely on synthetic data and transfers it against victim models trained with measured data.Compared with the current measured-to-measured (M2M) transfer setting, our approach does not need direct access to the victim model or the measured SAR data.We also propose the transferability estimation attack (TEA) to uncover the adversarial risks in this more challenging and practical scenario.The TEA makes full use of the limited similarity between the synthetic and measured data pairs for blind estimation and optimization of S2M transferability, leading to feasible surrogate model enhancement without mastering the victim model and data.Comprehensive evaluations based on the publicly available synthetic and measured paired labeled experiment (SAMPLE) dataset demonstrate that the TEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can significantly enhance various attack algorithms in computer vision and remote sensing applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and data are available at https://github.com/scenarri/S2M-TEA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>The effectiveness of an IR system is gauged not just by its ability to retrieve relevant results but also by how it presents these results to users; an engaging presentation often correlates with increased user satisfaction.While existing research has delved into the link between user satisfaction, IR performance metrics, and presentation, these aspects have typically been investigated in isolation.Our research aims to bridge this gap by examining the relationship between query performance, presentation and user satisfaction.For our analysis, we conducted a between-subjects experiment comparing the effectiveness of various result card layouts for an ad-hoc news search interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing data from the TREC WaPo 2018 collection, we centered our study on four specific topics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Within each of these topics, we assessed six distinct queries with varying nDCG values.Our study involved 164 participants who were exposed to one of five distinct layouts containing result cards, such as "title'', "title+image'', or "title+image+summary''.Our findings indicate that while nDCG is a strong predictor of user satisfaction at the query level, there exists no linear relationship between the performance of the query, presentation of results and user satisfaction.However, when considering the total gain on the initial result page, we observed that presentation does play a significant role in user satisfaction (at the query level) for certain layouts with result cards such as, title+image or title+image+summary.Our results also suggest that the layout differences have complex and multifaceted impacts on satisfaction.We demonstrate the capacity to equalize user satisfaction levels between queries of varying performance by changing how results are presented.This emphasizes the necessity to harmonize both performance and presentation in IR systems, considering users' diverse preferences.</p>

                  <p>Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance due to the inconsistency of annotated points.Existing POL heavily rely on strict annotation rules, which are difficult to define and apply, to handle the problem.In this study, we propose coarse point refinement (CPR), which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from an algorithmic perspective.CPR reduces the semantic variance by selecting a semantic centre point in a neighbourhood region to replace the initial annotated point.Furthermore, We design a sampling region estimation module to dynamically compute a sampling region for each object and use a cascaded structure to achieve end-to-end optimization.We further integrate a variance regularization into the structure to concentrate the predicted scores, yielding CPR++.We observe that CPR++ can obtain scale information and further reduce the semantic variance in a global region, thus guaranteeing high-performance object localization.Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of both CPR and CPR++.We hope our work can inspire more research on designing algorithms rather than annotation rules to address the semantic variance problem in POL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code will be public at github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study tackles key obstacles in adopting surgical navigation in orthopedic surgeries, including time, cost, radiation, and workflow integration challenges.Recently, our work X23D showed an approach for generating 3D anatomical models of the spine from only a few intraoperative fluoroscopic images.This negates the need for conventional registration-based surgical navigation by creating a direct intraoperative 3D reconstruction of the anatomy.Despite these strides, the practical application of X23D has been limited by a domain gap between synthetic training data and real intraoperative images.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we devised a novel data collection protocol for a paired dataset consisting of synthetic and real fluoroscopic images from the same perspectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>Utilizing this dataset, we refined our deep learning model via transfer learning, effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real X-ray data.A novel style transfer mechanism also allows us to convert real X-rays to mirror the synthetic domain, enabling our in-silico-trained X23D model to achieve high accuracy in real-world settings.   Our results demonstrated that the refined model can rapidly generate accurate 3D reconstructions of the entire lumbar spine from as few as three intraoperative fluoroscopic shots.It achieved an 84% F1 score, matching the accuracy of our previous synthetic data-based research.Additionally, with a computational time of only 81.1 ms, our approach provides real-time capabilities essential for surgery integration.   Through examining ideal imaging setups and view angle dependencies, we've further confirmed our system's practicality and dependability in clinical settings.Our research marks a significant step forward in intraoperative 3D reconstruction, offering enhancements to surgical planning, navigation, and robotics.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer utilizing multilingual LLMs has become a popular learning paradigm for low-resource languages with no labeled training data.However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods.Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues.Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies.This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data.We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages.The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment.</p>

                  <p>In text classification, creating an adversarial example means subtly perturbing a few words in a sentence without changing its meaning, causing it to be misclassified by a classifier.A concerning observation is that a significant portion of adversarial examples generated by existing methods change only one word.This single-word perturbation vulnerability represents a significant weakness in classifiers, which malicious users can exploit to efficiently create a multitude of adversarial examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper studies this problem and makes the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a novel metric \r{ho} to quantitatively assess a classifier's robustness against single-word perturbation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>(2) We present the SP-Attack, designed to exploit the single-word perturbation vulnerability, achieving a higher attack success rate, better preserving sentence meaning, while reducing computation costs compared to state-of-the-art adversarial methods.(3) We propose SP-Defense, which aims to improve \r{ho} by applying data augmentation in learning.Experimental results on 4 datasets and BERT and distilBERT classifiers show that SP-Defense improves \r{ho} by 14.6% and 13.9% and decreases the attack success rate of SP-Attack by 30.4% and 21.2% on two classifiers respectively, and decreases the attack success rate of existing attack methods that involve multiple-word perturbations.</p>

                  <p>Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation has received increasing attention due to its low annotation cost.Existing methods mainly rely on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to obtain pseudo-labels for training semantic segmentation models.In this work, we are the first to demonstrate that long-tailed distribution in training data can cause the CAM calculated through classifier weights over-activated for head classes and under-activated for tail classes due to the shared features among head- and tail- classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This degrades pseudo-label quality and further influences final semantic segmentation performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To address this issue, we propose a Shared Feature Calibration (SFC) method for CAM generation.Specifically, we leverage the class prototypes that carry positive shared features and propose a Multi-Scaled Distribution-Weighted (MSDW) consistency loss for narrowing the gap between the CAMs generated through classifier weights and class prototypes during training.The MSDW loss counterbalances over-activation and under-activation by calibrating the shared features in head-/tail-class classifier weights.Experimental results show that our SFC significantly improves CAM boundaries and achieves new state-of-the-art performances.The project is available at https://github.com/Barrett-python/SFC.</p>

                  <p>When comprehending code, a helping hand may come from the natural language comments documenting it that, unfortunately, are not always there.To support developers in such a scenario, several techniques have been presented to automatically generate natural language summaries for a given code.Most recent approaches exploit deep learning (DL) to automatically document classes or functions, while little effort has been devoted to more fine-grained documentation (e.g., documenting code snippets or even a single statement).Such a design choice is dictated by the availability of training data: For example, in the case of Java, it is easy to create datasets composed of pairs <Method, Javadoc> that can be fed to DL models to teach them how to summarize a method.Such a comment-to-code linking is instead non-trivial when it comes to inner comments documenting a few statements.In this work, we take all the steps needed to train a DL model to document code snippets.First, we manually built a dataset featuring 6.6k comments that have been (i) classified based on their type (e.g., code summary, TODO), and (ii) linked to the code statements they document.Second, we used such a dataset to train a multi-task DL model, taking as input a comment and being able to (i) classify whether it represents a "code summary" or not and (ii) link it to the code statements it documents.Our model identifies code summaries with 84% accuracy and is able to link them to the documented lines of code with recall and precision higher than 80%.Third, we run this model on 10k projects, identifying and linking code summaries to the documented code.This unlocked the possibility of building a large-scale dataset of documented code snippets that have then been used to train a new DL model able to document code snippets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comparison with state-of-the-art baselines shows the superiority of the proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce SymbolicAI, a versatile and modular framework employing a logic-based approach to concept learning and flow management in generative processes.SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI.We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths.The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for data stream manipulation, aligning LLM outputs with user objectives.As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models endowed with zero- and few-shot learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems.In turn, the framework facilitates the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs.We conclude by introducing a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows.We refer to the empirical score as the "Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity", or VERTEX score for short.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework codebase and benchmark are linked below. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Early time classification algorithms aim to label a stream of features without processing the full input stream, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that achieved by applying the classifier to the entire input.In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework that can be applied to any sequential classifier, formulating a calibrated stopping rule.This data-driven rule attains finite-sample, distribution-free control of the accuracy gap between full and early-time classification.We start by presenting a novel method that builds on the Learn-then-Test calibration framework to control this gap marginally, on average over i.i.d. instances.As this algorithm tends to yield an excessively high accuracy gap for early halt times, our main contribution is the proposal of a framework that controls a stronger notion of error, where the accuracy gap is controlled conditionally on the accumulated halt times.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, applicability, and usefulness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>We show that our proposed early stopping mechanism reduces up to 94% of timesteps used for classification while achieving rigorous accuracy gap control.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), especially Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, have significantly advanced in the industry in recent years.However, these models' broader development faces considerable challenges due to high operational and deployment costs.This has led to active research in improving the hardware efficiency of LLMs.Yet, the characteristics of real-world LLM workloads are often overlooked in current optimizations of LLM serving systems.In this work, we find that the absence of reliable workload data for evaluating LLM serving systems impacts the quality of service (QoS) and reliability in industrial deployments.This paper introduces the first real-world trace dataset of LLM serving workloads, detailing user, system, and LLM behaviors.We analyze this trace, highlighting burstiness, request and response distributions, and focusing on the reliability of GPT services.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this, we have developed a benchmark suite that reflects our dataset's workload patterns, enabling performance evaluation of serving systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>This suite captures the core patterns of workload distributions, allowing for precise scaling of the workload dataset to match system sizes.Our evaluation uncovers a previously unrecognized vulnerability of LLM serving systems to short-term burstiness, particularly in common workload scenarios.We observe that GPU memory limitations, caused by the fluctuating nature of burstiness, lead to significant performance degradation in existing LLM serving systems.Beyond benchmarking, understanding these patterns is valuable for optimizing LLM workload management, enabling elastic hardware resource adjustments to varying workloads.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make the dataset and benchmark suite publicly available to encourage further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>In real-world applications, there is often a domain shift from training to test data.This observation resulted in the development of test-time adaptation (TTA).It aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to the test data without requiring access to the source data.Thereby, most existing works are limited to the closed-set assumption, i.e. there is no category shift between source and target domain.We argue that in a realistic open-world setting a category shift can appear in addition to a domain shift.This means, individual source classes may not appear in the target domain anymore, samples of new classes may be part of the target domain or even both at the same time.Moreover, in many real-world scenarios the test data is not accessible all at once but arrives sequentially as a stream of batches demanding an immediate prediction.Hence, TTA must be applied in an online manner.To the best of our knowledge, the combination of these aspects, i.e. online source-free universal domain adaptation (online SF-UniDA), has not been studied yet.In this paper, we introduce a Contrastive Mean Teacher (COMET) tailored to this novel scenario.It applies a contrastive loss to rebuild a feature space where the samples of known classes build distinct clusters and the samples of new classes separate well from them.It is complemented by an entropy loss which ensures that the classifier output has a small entropy for samples of known classes and a large entropy for samples of new classes to be easily detected and rejected as unknown.To provide the losses with reliable pseudo labels, they are embedded into a mean teacher (MT) framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method across two datasets and all category shifts to set an initial benchmark for online SF-UniDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Thereby, COMET yields state-of-the-art performance and proves to be consistent and robust across a variety of different scenarios.</p>

To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance.To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score.Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

Our ambition is to better manage the energy/computation time trade-off, and to explicitly embed the resolution of the data in the time domain.We aim to recast calculations into the ``for free'' format that time offers, and in addition, perform these calculations at the highest clock or oscillator resolution possible.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic recourse -- providing recommendations to those affected negatively by the outcome of an algorithmic system on how they can take action and change that outcome -- has gained attention as a means of giving persons agency in their interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) systems.Recent work has shown that even if an AI decision-making classifier is ``fair'' (according to some reasonable criteria), recourse itself may be unfair due to differences in the initial circumstances of individuals, compounding disparities for marginalized populations and requiring them to exert more effort than others.There is a need to define more methods and metrics for evaluating fairness in recourse that span a range of normative views of the world, and specifically those that take into account time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Time is a critical element in recourse because the longer it takes an individual to act, the more the setting may change due to model or data drift.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>This paper seeks to close this research gap by proposing two notions of fairness in recourse that are in normative alignment with substantive equality of opportunity, and that consider time.The first considers the (often repeated) effort individuals exert per successful recourse event, and the second considers time per successful recourse event.Building upon an agent-based framework for simulating recourse, this paper demonstrates how much effort is needed to overcome disparities in initial circumstances.We then proposes an intervention to improve the fairness of recourse by rewarding effort, and compare it to existing strategies.</p>

Third, we study infinite families of forbidden subgraphs, obtaining NP-hardness for Bipartite-VS and Perfect-VS.Finally, we touch upon the parameterized complexity of $\Pi$-VS with respect to the number of allowed splits, showing para-NP-hardness for $K_3$-Free-VS and deriving an XP-algorithm when each vertex is only allowed to be split at most once.</p>

                  <p>In the exciting generative AI era, the diffusion model has emerged as a very powerful and widely adopted content generation and editing tool for various data modalities, making the study of their potential security risks very necessary and critical.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Very recently, some pioneering works have shown the vulnerability of the diffusion model against backdoor attacks, calling for in-depth analysis and investigation of the security challenges of this popular and fundamental AI technique.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the detectability of the poisoned noise input for the backdoored diffusion models, an important performance metric yet little explored in the existing works.Starting from the perspective of a defender, we first analyze the properties of the trigger pattern in the existing diffusion backdoor attacks, discovering the important role of distribution discrepancy in Trojan detection.Based on this finding, we propose a low-cost trigger detection mechanism that can effectively identify the poisoned input noise.We then take a further step to study the same problem from the attack side, proposing a backdoor attack strategy that can learn the unnoticeable trigger to evade our proposed detection scheme.   Empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trigger detection and detection-evading attack strategy.For trigger detection, our distribution discrepancy-based solution can achieve a 100\% detection rate for the Trojan triggers used in the existing works.For evading trigger detection, our proposed stealthy trigger design approach performs end-to-end learning to make the distribution of poisoned noise input approach that of benign noise, enabling nearly 100\% detection pass rate with very high attack and benign performance for the backdoored diffusion models.</p>

Empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trigger detection and detection-evading attack strategy.For trigger detection, our distribution discrepancy-based solution can achieve a 100\% detection rate for the Trojan triggers used in the existing works.For evading trigger detection, our proposed stealthy trigger design approach performs end-to-end learning to make the distribution of poisoned noise input approach that of benign noise, enabling nearly 100\% detection pass rate with very high attack and benign performance for the backdoored diffusion models.</p>

                  <p>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a powerful framework for learning complex behaviors from expert demonstrations.However, it traditionally requires repeatedly solving a computationally expensive reinforcement learning (RL) problem in its inner loop.It is desirable to reduce the exploration burden by leveraging expert demonstrations in the inner-loop RL.As an example, recent work resets the learner to expert states in order to inform the learner of high-reward expert states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such an approach is infeasible in the real world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>In this work, we consider an alternative approach to speeding up the RL subroutine in IRL: \emph{pessimism}, i.e., staying close to the expert's data distribution, instantiated via the use of offline RL algorithms.We formalize a connection between offline RL and IRL, enabling us to use an arbitrary offline RL algorithm to improve the sample efficiency of IRL.We validate our theory experimentally by demonstrating a strong correlation between the efficacy of an offline RL algorithm and how well it works as part of an IRL procedure.By using a strong offline RL algorithm as part of an IRL procedure, we are able to find policies that match expert performance significantly more efficiently than the prior art.</p>

                  <p>The effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is critical in an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex.Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying attacks and anomalies in computer networks.However, using ML and DL models in IDS has led to a trust deficit due to their non-transparent decision-making.This transparency gap in IDS research is significant, affecting confidence and accountability.To address, this paper introduces a novel Explainable IDS approach, called X-CBA, that leverages the structural advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to effectively process network traffic data, while also adapting a new Explainable AI (XAI) methodology.Unlike most GNN-based IDS that depend on labeled network traffic and node features, thereby overlooking critical packet-level information, our approach leverages a broader range of traffic data through network flows, including edge attributes, to improve detection capabilities and adapt to novel threats.Through empirical testing, we establish that our approach not only achieves high accuracy with 99.47% in threat detection but also advances the field by providing clear, actionable explanations of its analytical outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research also aims to bridge the current gap and facilitate the broader integration of ML/DL technologies in cybersecurity defenses by offering a local and global explainability solution that is both precise and interpretable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.582</span></span></p>
