                  <p>While closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving abilities, open-source models continue to struggle with such tasks.To bridge this gap, we propose a data augmentation approach and introduce PersonaMathQA, a dataset derived from MATH and GSM8K, on which we train the PersonaMath models.Our approach consists of two stages: the first stage is learning from Persona Diversification, and the second stage is learning from Reflection.In the first stage, we regenerate detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions as instructions using a closed-source LLM and introduce a novel persona-driven data augmentation technique to enhance the dataset's quantity and diversity.In the second stage, we incorporate reflection to fully leverage more challenging and valuable questions.Evaluation of our PersonaMath models on MATH and GSM8K reveals that the PersonaMath-7B model (based on LLaMA-2-7B) achieves an accuracy of 24.2% on MATH and 68.7% on GSM8K, surpassing all baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance.Notably, our dataset contains only 70.3K data points-merely 17.8% of MetaMathQA and 27% of MathInstruct-yet our model outperforms these baselines, demonstrating the high quality and diversity of our dataset, which enables more efficient model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source the PersonaMathQA dataset, PersonaMath models, and our code for public usage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.903</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex systems involving structured data and relationships.Consequently, graph representation learning, which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional representations of graphs, has drawn a lot of attention in recent years.The overwhelming majority of existing methods handle unsigned graphs.However, signed graphs appear in an increasing number of application domains to model systems involving two types of opposed relationships.Several authors took an interest in signed graphs and proposed methods for providing vertex-level representations, but only one exists for whole-graph representations, and it can handle only fully connected graphs.In this article, we tackle this issue by proposing two approaches to learning whole-graph representations of general signed graphs.The first is a SG2V, a signed generalization of the whole-graph embedding method Graph2vec that relies on a modification of the Weisfeiler--Lehman relabelling procedure.The second one is WSGCN, a whole-graph generalization of the signed vertex embedding method SGCN that relies on the introduction of master nodes into the GCN.We propose several variants of both these approaches.A bottleneck in the development of whole-graph-oriented methods is the lack of data.We constitute a benchmark composed of three collections of signed graphs with corresponding ground truths.We assess our methods on this benchmark, and our results show that the signed whole-graph methods learn better representations for this task.Overall, the baseline obtains an F-measure score of 58.57, when SG2V and WSGCN reach 73.01 and 81.20, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and benchmark dataset are both publicly available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>In industrial manufacturing of glass bottles, quality control of bottle prints is necessary as numerous factors can negatively affect the printing process.Even minor defects in the bottle prints must be detected despite reflections in the glass or manufacturing-related deviations.In cooperation with our medium-sized industrial partner, two ML-based approaches for quality control of these bottle prints were developed and evaluated, which can also be used in this challenging scenario.Our first approach utilized different filters to supress reflections (e.g. Sobel or Canny) and image quality metrics for image comparison (e.g. MSE or SSIM) as features for different supervised classification models (e.g. SVM or k-Neighbors), which resulted in an accuracy of 84%.The images were aligned based on the ORB algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the rotations of the prints, which may serve as an indicator for anomalies in the manufacturing process.In our second approach, we fine-tuned different pre-trained CNN models (e.g. ResNet or VGG) for binary classification, which resulted in an accuracy of 87%.Utilizing Grad-Cam on our fine-tuned ResNet-34, we were able to localize and visualize frequently defective bottle print regions.This method allowed us to provide insights that could be used to optimize the actual manufacturing process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper also describes our general approach and the challenges we encountered in practice with data collection during ongoing production, unsupervised preselection, and labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks.However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge.To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities.In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM.Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification.To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector.Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains.We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics.Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating images with accurately represented text, especially in non-Latin languages, poses a significant challenge for diffusion models.Existing approaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary networks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue.However, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text generation, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small fonts.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual text creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text during the image generation process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our methodology begins with assembling a training dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.904</span></span>Each pair includes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the font style within the image.We then developed a text control network, Font ControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image generation.To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style, notably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware loss into the diffusion process.This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text rendering using low-level descriptors.Our evaluations, based on both visual and accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.Additionally, JoyType can function as a plugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with other stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI.Our project is open-sourced on https://jdh-algo.github.io/JoyType/.</p>

                  <p>Extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information.Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs.To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries.Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information.This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation.Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with long-context processing are still challenging because of their implementation complexity, training efficiency and data sparsity.To address this issue, a new paradigm named Online Long-context Processing (OLP) is proposed when we process a document of unlimited length, which typically occurs in the information reception and organization of diverse streaming media such as automated news reporting, live e-commerce, and viral short videos.Moreover, a dilemma was often encountered when we tried to select the most suitable LLM from a large number of LLMs amidst explosive growth aiming for outstanding performance, affordable prices, and short response delays.In view of this, we also develop Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline according to their actual performance.Extensive experiments are conducted on our OLP-MINI dataset and it is found that OLP with Role-RL framework achieves OLP benchmark with an average recall rate of 93.2% and the LLM cost saved by 79.4%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Role-RL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.912</span></span></p>

                  <p>The widespread success of deep learning models today is owed to the curation of extensive datasets significant in size and complexity.However, such models frequently pick up inherent biases in the data during the training process, leading to unreliable predictions.Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance.In this paper, we present CONBIAS, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets.CONBIAS represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset.Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks.Extensive experiments show that data augmentation based on a balanced concept distribution augmented by CONBIAS improves generalization performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make our code and data publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span></p>

Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T.

                  <p>Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks.Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources.Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization.However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances.This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy.Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness.Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration.First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency.Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Deploying large language models in production requires simultaneous attention to efficiency and risk control.Prior work has shown the possibility to cut costs while maintaining similar accuracy, but has neglected to focus on risk control.By contrast, here we present hierarchical chains with multi-level abstention (HCMA), which use model-intrinsic uncertainty to delegate queries along the LLM intelligence hierarchy, enabling training-free model switching based solely on black-box API calls.Our framework presents novel trade-offs between efficiency and risk.For example, deploying HCMA on MMLU cuts the error rate of Llama3 405B by 30% when the model is allowed to abstain on 20% of the queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To calibrate HCMA for optimal performance, our approach uses data-efficient logistic regressions (based on a simple nonlinear feature transformation), which require only 50 or 100 labeled examples to achieve excellent calibration error (ECE), cutting ECE by 50% compared to naive Platt scaling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>On free-form generation tasks, we find that chain-of-thought is ineffectual for selective prediction, whereas zero-shot prompting drives error to 0% on TruthfulQA at high abstention rates.As LLMs are increasingly deployed across computing environments with different capabilities (such as mobile, laptop, and cloud), our framework paves the way towards maintaining deployment efficiency while putting in place sharp risk controls.</p>

                  <p>Ego-centric queries, focusing on a target vertex and its direct neighbors, are essential for various applications.Enabling such queries on graphs owned by mutually distrustful data providers, without breaching privacy, holds promise for more comprehensive results.   In this paper, we propose GORAM, a graph-oriented data structure that enables efficient ego-centric queries on federated graphs with strong privacy guarantees.GORAM is built upon secure multi-party computation (MPC) and ensures that no single party can learn any sensitive information about the graph data or the querying keys during the process.However, achieving practical performance with privacy guaranteed presents a challenge.To overcome this, GORAM is designed to partition the federated graph and construct an Oblivious RAM(ORAM)-inspired index atop these partitions.This design enables each ego-centric query to process only a single partition, which can be accessed fast and securely.   To evaluate the performance of GORAM, we developed a prototype querying engine on a real-world MPC framework.We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with five commonly used queries on both synthetic and real-world graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that all benchmark queries can be completed in just 58.1 milliseconds to 35.7 seconds, even on graphs with up to 41.6 million vertices and 1.4 billion edges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first instance of processing billion-scale graphs with practical performance on MPC.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) has gained considerable popularity for distributed machine learning due to its ability to preserve the privacy of participating agents by eliminating the need for data aggregation.Nevertheless, communication costs between agents and the central server in FL are substantial in large-scale problems and remain a limiting factor for this algorithm.This paper introduces an innovative algorithm, called \emph{FedScalar}, within the federated learning framework aimed at improving communication efficiency.Unlike traditional FL methods that require agents to send high-dimensional vectors to the server, \emph{FedScalar} enables agents to communicate updates using a single scalar.Each agent encodes its updated model parameters into a scalar through the inner product between its local update difference and a random vector, which is then transmitted to the server.The server decodes this information by projecting the averaged scalar values onto the random vector.Our method thereby significantly reduces communication overhead.Technically, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ to a stationary point for smooth, non-convex loss functions.Additionally, our analysis shows that altering the underlying distribution of the random vector generated by the server can reduce the variance during the aggregation step of the algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we validate the performance and communication efficiency of our algorithm with numerical simulations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual language tracking (VLT) has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, harnessing linguistic data to enhance algorithms with multi-modal inputs and broadening the scope of traditional single object tracking (SOT) to encompass video understanding applications.Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still depend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video.These descriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content dynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform level of detail and a fixed annotation frequency.As a result, algorithms tend to default to a "memorize the answer" strategy, diverging from the core objective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content.Fortunately, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of diverse text.This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations (in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks, thereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark.Specifically, we (1) propose a new visual language tracking benchmark with diverse texts, named DTVLT, based on five prominent VLT and SOT benchmarks, including three sub-tasks: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking.(2) We offer four granularity texts in our benchmark, considering the extent and density of semantic information.We expect this multi-granular generation strategy to foster a favorable environment for VLT and video understanding research.(3) We conduct comprehensive experimental analyses on DTVLT, evaluating the impact of diverse text on tracking performance and hope the identified performance bottlenecks of existing algorithms can support further research in VLT and video understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed benchmark, experimental results and toolkit will be released gradually on http://videocube.aitestunion.com/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span></p>

                  <p>In strategic classification, agents manipulate their features, at a cost, to receive a positive classification outcome from the learner's classifier.The goal of the learner in such settings is to learn a classifier that is robust to strategic manipulations.While the majority of works in this domain consider accuracy as the primary objective of the learner, in this work, we consider learning objectives that have group fairness guarantees in addition to accuracy guarantees.We work with the minimax group fairness notion that asks for minimizing the maximal group error rate across population groups.   We formalize a fairness-aware Stackelberg game between a population of agents consisting of several groups, with each group having its own cost function, and a learner in the agnostic PAC setting in which the learner is working with a hypothesis class H. When the cost functions of the agents are separable, we show the existence of an efficient algorithm that finds an approximately optimal deterministic classifier for the learner when the number of groups is small.This algorithm remains efficient, both statistically and computationally, even when H is the set of all classifiers.We then consider cost functions that are not necessarily separable and show the existence of oracle-efficient algorithms that find approximately optimal randomized classifiers for the learner when H has finite strategic VC dimension.These algorithms work under the assumption that the learner is fully transparent: the learner draws a classifier from its distribution (randomized classifier) before the agents respond by manipulating their feature vectors.We highlight the effectiveness of such transparency in developing oracle-efficient algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude with verifying the efficacy of our algorithms on real data by conducting an experimental analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised stereo matching holds great promise for application and research due to its independence from expensive labeled data.However, direct self-supervised stereo matching paradigms based on photometric loss functions have consistently struggled with performance issues due to the occlusion challenge.The crux of the occlusion challenge lies in the fact that the positions of occluded pixels consistently align with the epipolar search direction defined by the input stereo images, leading to persistent information loss and erroneous feedback at fixed locations during self-supervised training.In this work, we propose a simple yet highly effective pseudo-stereo inputs strategy to address the core occlusion challenge.This strategy decouples the input and feedback images, compelling the network to probabilistically sample information from both sides of the occluding objects.As a result, the persistent lack of information in the aforementioned fixed occlusion areas is mitigated.Building upon this, we further address feedback conflicts and overfitting issues arising from the strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating these components, our method achieves stable and significant performance improvements compared to existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>Qualitative experiments further demonstrate accurate disparity inference even at occluded regions.These results demonstrate a significant advancement over previous methods in the field of direct self-supervised stereo matching based on photometric loss.The proposed pseudo-stereo inputs strategy, due to its simplicity and effectiveness, has the potential to serve as a new paradigm for direct self-supervised stereo matching.Code is available at https://github.com/qrzyang/Pseudo-Stereo.</p>

                  <p>Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging approach that enables nodes to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data.In many application domains, such as healthcare, this approach faces challenges due to the high level of heterogeneity in the training data's feature space.Such feature heterogeneity lowers model utility and negatively impacts fairness, particularly for nodes with under-represented training data.In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Facade}, a clustering-based DL algorithm specifically designed for fair model training when the training data exhibits several distinct features.The challenge of \textsc{Facade} is to assign nodes to clusters, one for each feature, based on the similarity in the features of their local data, without requiring individual nodes to know apriori which cluster they belong to.\textsc{Facade} (1) dynamically assigns nodes to their appropriate clusters over time, and (2) enables nodes to collaboratively train a specialized model for each cluster in a fully decentralized manner.We theoretically prove the convergence of \textsc{Facade}, implement our algorithm, and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of model accuracy and fairness compared to all three competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Compared to the best-performing baseline, \textsc{Facade} on the CIFAR-10 dataset also reduces communication costs by 32.3\% to reach a target accuracy when cluster sizes are imbalanced.</p>

                  <p>There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks.It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths.Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data.Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM).In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise.We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution.We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information.Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation.It is also more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID score) of up to 30% for both tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper reformulates cross-dataset human pose estimation as a continual learning task, aiming to integrate new keypoints and pose variations into existing models without losing accuracy on previously learned datasets.We benchmark this formulation against established regularization-based methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, including EWC, LFL, and LwF.Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method called Importance-Weighted Distillation (IWD), which enhances conventional LwF by introducing a layer-wise distillation penalty and dynamic temperature adjustment based on layer importance for previously learned knowledge.This allows for a controlled adaptation to new tasks that respects the stability-plasticity balance critical in continual learning.Through extensive experiments across three datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing regularization-based continual learning strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IWD shows an average improvement of 3.60\% over the state-of-the-art LwF method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>The results highlight the potential of our method to serve as a robust framework for real-world applications where models must evolve with new data without forgetting past knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Crack segmentation is crucial in civil engineering, particularly for assessing pavement integrity and ensuring the durability of infrastructure.While deep learning has advanced RGB-based segmentation, performance degrades under adverse conditions like low illumination or motion blur.Thermal imaging offers complementary information by capturing emitted radiation, improving crack detection in challenging environments.Combining RGB and thermal images (RGB-T) for crack segmentation shows promise in complex real-world conditions, such as adverse weather, yet research in this area remains limited.Current RGB-T segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities at various levels of interaction.To address this, we propose IRFusionFormer, a novel model for crack segmentation that effectively integrates RGB and thermal data.Our Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module captures multi-scale relationships and long-range dependencies between modalities without significant computational overhead.Additionally, we introduce the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision framework, which enhances interaction between modalities by distributing fused features across branches with joint supervision.To maintain the topological structure of cracks, we introduce a novel topology-based loss function that preserves connectivity during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 90.01% and an IoU of 81.83%, significantly improving robustness and accuracy in varying environmental conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>These advancements address key challenges in pavement crack segmentation, offering a more reliable and efficient solution.For access to the codes, data, and models from this study, visit https://github.com/sheauhuu/IRFusionFormer</p>

                  <p>Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems.State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors.However, the impacts of these different types of information are not clear.In addition, existing approaches have not captured the timestamps in the log data, which can potentially provide more fine-grained temporal information than sequential information.In this work, we propose a configurable transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's features.Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs.With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When presented with log sequences of varying lengths, the model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance compared to the baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>The results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection in the studied public datasets.On the other hand, the findings also reveal the simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance.However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-intensive, rendering frequent retraining or updates impractical.Consequently, time-sensitive data can become outdated, potentially misleading LLMs in time-aware tasks.For example, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various programs every day.Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities.Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue.   To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications.This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring.However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness.The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>Our contributions are threefold:First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks.Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training.Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT).Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p>

                  <p>Preference optimization methods typically begin training with a well-trained SFT model as a reference model.In RLHF and DPO, a regularization term is used during the preference optimization process to prevent the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model's distribution, thereby avoiding the generation of anomalous responses.When the reference model is already well-aligned with the given data or only requires slight adjustments, this approach can produce a well-aligned model.However, if the reference model is not aligned with the given data and requires significant deviation from its current state, a regularization term may actually hinder the model alignment.In this study, we propose \textbf{Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO)} to address this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MIPO modulates the degree of intervention from the reference model based on how well the given data is aligned with it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If the data is well-aligned, the intervention is increased to prevent the policy model from diverging significantly from reference model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span>Conversely, if the alignment is poor, the interference is reduced to facilitate more extensive training.We compare the performance of MIPO and DPO using Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B in Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench.The experimental results demonstrate that MIPO consistently outperforms DPO across various evaluation scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code.Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved.To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews.Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation.Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture.However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training.This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback.To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality.Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function.Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour.Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions.For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data.Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the Gaussian derivative networks achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks.   We first experimentally demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales.Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties.We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation.   In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of Gaussian derivative networks, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have very good explainability properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

The study consists of two parts: Part I assesses differences in semantic tones across social relationship categories, and Part II examines the similarity between comments generated by Llama 3.0 (70B) and human comments from Part I given public Facebook posts as input.Part I results show that including social relationship information improves the ability of a model to predict the semantic tone of human comments.However, Part II results show that even without including social context information in the prompt, LLM-generated comments and human comments are equally sensitive to social context, suggesting that LLMs can comprehend semantics from the original post alone.When we include all social relationship information in the prompt, the similarity between human comments and LLM-generated comments decreases.This inconsistency may occur because LLMs did not include social context information as part of their training data.Together these results demonstrate the ability of LLMs to comprehend semantics from the original post and respond similarly to human comments, but also highlights their limitations in generalizing personalized comments through prompting alone.</p>

                  <p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains, including Web search, healthcare, and software development.However, as these models scale, they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, particularly backdoor attacks.By exploiting the potent memorization capacity of LLMs, adversaries can easily inject backdoors into LLMs by manipulating a small portion of training data, leading to malicious behaviors in downstream applications whenever the hidden backdoor is activated by the pre-defined triggers.Moreover, emerging learning paradigms like instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) exacerbate these risks as they rely heavily on crowdsourced data and human feedback, which are not fully controlled.In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of emerging backdoor threats to LLMs that appear during LLM development or inference, and cover recent advancement in both defense and detection strategies for mitigating backdoor threats to LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also outline key challenges in addressing these threats, highlighting areas for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM).However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives).Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations.This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize.In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO).The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner.It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding.Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding.Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses.This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p>

                Slowly Scaling Per-Record Differential Privacy

                  <p>We develop formal privacy mechanisms for releasing statistics from data with many outlying values, such as income data.These mechanisms ensure that a per-record differential privacy guarantee degrades slowly in the protected records' influence on the statistics being released.   Formal privacy mechanisms generally add randomness, or "noise," to published statistics.If a noisy statistic's distribution changes little with the addition or deletion of a single record in the underlying dataset, an attacker looking at this statistic will find it plausible that any particular record was present or absent, preserving the records' privacy.More influential records -- those whose addition or deletion would change the statistics' distribution more -- typically suffer greater privacy loss.The per-record differential privacy framework quantifies these record-specific privacy guarantees, but existing mechanisms let these guarantees degrade rapidly (linearly or quadratically) with influence.While this may be acceptable in cases with some moderately influential records, it results in unacceptably high privacy losses when records' influence varies widely, as is common in economic data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop mechanisms with privacy guarantees that instead degrade as slowly as logarithmically with influence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>These mechanisms allow for the accurate, unbiased release of statistics, while providing meaningful protection for highly influential records.As an example, we consider the private release of sums of unbounded establishment data such as payroll, where our mechanisms extend meaningful privacy protection even to very large establishments.We evaluate these mechanisms empirically and demonstrate their utility.</p>
