                  <p>The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies.Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span>PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores.Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality.Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</p>

                  <p>Police departments around the world use two-way radio for coordination.These broadcast police communications (BPC) are a unique source of information about everyday police activity and emergency response.Yet BPC are not transcribed, and their naturalistic audio properties make automatic transcription challenging.We collect a corpus of roughly 62,000 manually transcribed radio transmissions (~46 hours of audio) to evaluate the feasibility of automatic speech recognition (ASR) using modern recognition models.We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf speech recognizers, models fine-tuned on BPC data, and customized end-to-end models.We find that both human and machine transcription is challenging in this domain.Large off-the-shelf ASR models perform poorly, but fine-tuned models can reach the approximate range of human performance.Our work suggests directions for future work, including analysis of short utterances and potential miscommunication in police radio interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our corpus and data annotation pipeline available to other researchers, to enable further research on recognition and analysis of police communication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software logs, generated during the runtime of software systems, are essential for various development and analysis activities, such as anomaly detection and failure diagnosis.However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks.While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization.To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices.We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs.Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches.Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices.Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines.By combining insights from regulatory, academic, and industry perspectives, our study aims to provide a clearer framework for identifying and protecting sensitive information in software logs.</p>

                  <p>While success in many robotics tasks can be determined by only observing the final state and how it differs from the initial state - e.g., if an apple is picked up - many tasks require observing the full motion of the robot to correctly determine success.For example, brushing hair requires repeated strokes that correspond to the contours and type of hair.Prior works often use off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs) as success detectors; however, when success depends on the full trajectory, VLMs struggle to make correct judgments for two reasons.First, modern VLMs are trained only on single frames, and cannot capture changes over a full trajectory.Second, even if we provide state-of-the-art VLMs with an aggregate input of multiple frames, they still fail to detect success due to a lack of robot data.Our key idea is to fine-tune VLMs using abstract representations that are able to capture trajectory-level information such as the path the robot takes by overlaying keypoint trajectories on the final image.We propose motion instruction fine-tuning (MotIF), a method that fine-tunes VLMs using the aforementioned abstract representations to semantically ground the robot's behavior in the environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To benchmark and fine-tune VLMs for robotic motion understanding, we introduce the MotIF-1K dataset containing 653 human and 369 robot demonstrations across 13 task categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>MotIF assesses the success of robot motion given the image observation of the trajectory, task instruction, and motion description.Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs by at least twice in precision and 56.1% in recall, generalizing across unseen motions, tasks, and environments.Finally, we demonstrate practical applications of MotIF in refining and terminating robot planning, and ranking trajectories on how they align with task and motion descriptions.Project page: https://motif-1k.github.io</p>

                  <p>For a vision-language model (VLM) to understand the physical world, such as cause and effect, a first step is to capture the temporal dynamics of the visual world, for example how the physical states of objects evolve over time (e.g. a whole apple into a sliced apple).Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs pre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be extracted with zero-shot text prompts.We curate an object state recognition dataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models trained with contrastive and generative objectives.We observe that while these state-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects' physical states.Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and code are released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical image segmentation, a critical application of semantic segmentation in healthcare, has seen significant advancements through specialized computer vision techniques.While deep learning-based medical image segmentation is essential for assisting in medical diagnosis, the lack of diverse training data causes the long-tail problem.Moreover, most previous hybrid CNN-ViT architectures have limited ability to combine various attentions in different layers of the Convolutional Neural Network.To address these issues, we propose a Lagrange Duality Consistency (LDC) Loss, integrated with Boundary-Aware Contrastive Loss, as the overall training objective for semi-supervised learning to mitigate the long-tail problem.Additionally, we introduce CMAformer, a novel network that synergizes the strengths of ResUNet and Transformer.The cross-attention block in CMAformer effectively integrates spatial attention and channel attention for multi-scale feature fusion.Overall, our results indicate that CMAformer, combined with the feature fusion framework and the new consistency loss, demonstrates strong complementarity in semi-supervised learning ensembles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple public medical image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Example code are available at: \url{https://github.com/lzeeorno/Lagrange-Duality-and-CMAformer}.</p>

                  <p>Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of research with attention from both academia and industry.While there are promising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and identity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the generative process.That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial animation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with emotional expressions at the same time.In addition, majority of the models are deterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output motion.We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate diverse and emotionally-rich facial animations.In this paper, we propose ProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and an emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD.We provide an extensive comparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation synthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and with a perceptual user study.We highlight several objective metrics that are more suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and ground truth data for subjective evaluation.To our knowledge, that is the first non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a rich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity levels.Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and non-deterministic models.We recommend watching the supplementary video for quality judgement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The entire codebase is publicly available (https://github.com/uuembodiedsocialai/ProbTalk3D/). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span></p>

                  <p>Matching users with mutual preferences is a critical aspect of services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search.To produce recommendations in such scenarios, one can predict match probabilities and construct rankings based on these predictions.However, this direct match prediction approach often underperforms due to the extreme sparsity of match labels.Therefore, most existing methods predict preferences separately for each direction (e.g., job seeker to employer and employer to job seeker) and then aggregate the predictions to generate overall matching scores and produce recommendations.However, this typical approach often leads to practical issues, such as biased error propagation between the two models.This paper introduces and demonstrates a novel and practical solution to improve reciprocal recommendations in production by leveraging \textit{pseudo-match scores}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach generates dense and more directly relevant pseudo-match scores by combining the true match labels, which are accurate but sparse, with relatively inaccurate but dense match predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We then train a meta-model to output the final match predictions by minimizing the prediction loss against the pseudo-match scores.Our method can be seen as a \textbf{best-of-both (BoB) approach}, as it combines the high-level ideas of both direct match prediction and the two separate models approach.It also allows for user-specific weights to construct \textit{personalized} pseudo-match scores, achieving even better matching performance through appropriate tuning of the weights.Offline experiments on real-world job search data demonstrate the superior performance of our BoB method, particularly with personalized pseudo-match scores, compared to existing approaches in terms of finding potential matches.</p>

                  <p>We study supervised classification for datasets with a very large number of input variables.The na\"ive Bayes classifier is attractive for its simplicity, scalability and effectiveness in many real data applications.When the strong na\"ive Bayes assumption of conditional independence of the input variables given the target variable is not valid, variable selection and model averaging are two common ways to improve the performance.In the case of the na\"ive Bayes classifier, the resulting weighting scheme on the models reduces to a weighting scheme on the variables.Here we focus on direct estimation of variable weights in such a weighted na\"ive Bayes classifier.We propose a sparse regularization of the model log-likelihood, which takes into account prior penalization costs related to each input variable.Compared to averaging based classifiers used up until now, our main goal is to obtain parsimonious robust models with less variables and equivalent performance.The direct estimation of the variable weights amounts to a non-convex optimization problem for which we propose and compare several two-stage algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, the criterion obtained by convex relaxation is minimized using several variants of standard gradient methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Then, the initial non-convex optimization problem is solved using local optimization methods initialized with the result of the first stage.The various proposed algorithms result in optimization-based weighted na\"ive Bayes classifiers, that are evaluated on benchmark datasets and positioned w.r.t.to a reference averaging-based classifier.</p>

                  <p>Reconstructing 3D visuals from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, introduced as Recon3DMind in our conference work, is of significant interest to both cognitive neuroscience and computer vision.To advance this task, we present the fMRI-3D dataset, which includes data from 15 participants and showcases a total of 4768 3D objects.The dataset comprises two components: fMRI-Shape, previously introduced and accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Shape, and fMRI-Objaverse, proposed in this paper and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Objaverse.fMRI-Objaverse includes data from 5 subjects, 4 of whom are also part of the Core set in fMRI-Shape, with each subject viewing 31423D objects across 117 categories, all accompanied by text captions.This significantly enhances the diversity and potential applications of the dataset.Additionally, we propose MinD-3D, a novel framework designed to decode 3D visual information from fMRI signals.The framework first extracts and aggregates features from fMRI data using a neuro-fusion encoder, then employs a feature-bridge diffusion model to generate visual features, and finally reconstructs the 3D object using a generative transformer decoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We establish new benchmarks by designing metrics at both semantic and structural levels to evaluate model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Furthermore, we assess our model's effectiveness in an Out-of-Distribution setting and analyze the attribution of the extracted features and the visual ROIs in fMRI signals.Our experiments demonstrate that MinD-3D not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic and spatial accuracy but also deepens our understanding of how human brain processes 3D visual information.Project page at: https://jianxgao.github.io/MinD-3D.</p>

                  <p>Background: Test flakiness is a major problem in the software industry.Flaky tests fail seemingly at random without changes to the code and thus impede continuous integration (CI).Some researchers argue that all tests can be considered flaky and that tests only differ in their frequency of flaky failures.   Aims: With the goal of developing mitigation strategies to reduce the negative impact of test flakiness, we study characteristics of tests and the test environment that potentially impact test flakiness.   Method: We construct two datasets based on SAP HANA's test results over a 12-week period: one based on production data, the other based on targeted test executions from a dedicated flakiness experiment.We conduct correlation analysis for test and test environment characteristics with respect to their influence on the frequency of flaky test failures.   Results:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our study, the average test execution time had the strongest positive correlation with the test flakiness rate (r = 0.79), which confirms previous studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Potential reasons for higher flakiness include the larger test scope of long-running tests or test executions on a slower test infrastructure.Interestingly, the load on the testing infrastructure was not correlated with test flakiness.The relationship between test flakiness and required resources for test execution is inconclusive.   Conclusions: Based on our findings, we conclude that splitting long-running tests can be an important measure for practitioners to cope with test flakiness, as it enables parallelization of test executions and also reduces the cost of re-executions.This effectively decreases the negative effects of test flakiness in complex testing environments.However, when splitting long-running tests, practitioners need to consider the potential test setup overhead of test splits.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation.Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge.In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget.Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning.In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs.According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop.Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes.Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</p>

                  <p>In bi-criteria optimization problems, the goal is typically to compute the set of Pareto-optimal solutions.Many algorithms for these types of problems rely on efficient merging or combining of partial solutions and filtering of dominated solutions in the resulting sets.In this article, we consider the task of computing the Pareto sum of two given Pareto sets $A, B$ of size $n$. The Pareto sum $C$ contains all non-dominated points of the Minkowski sum $M = \{a+b|a \in A, b\in B\}$. Since the Minkowski sum has a size of $n^2$, but the Pareto sum $C$ can be much smaller, the goal is to compute $C$ without having to compute and store all of $M$. We present several new algorithms for efficient Pareto sum computation, including an output-sensitive successive algorithm with a running time of $O(n \log n + nk)$ and a space consumption of $O(n+k)$ for $k=|C|$. If the elements of $C$ are streamed, the space consumption reduces to $O(n)$. For output sizes $k \geq 2n$, we prove a conditional lower bound for Pareto sum computation, which excludes running times in $O(n^{2-\delta})$ for $\delta > 0$ unless the (min,+)-convolution hardness conjecture fails.The successive algorithm matches this lower bound for $k \in \Theta(n)$. However, for $k \in \Theta(n^2)$, the successive algorithm exhibits a cubic running time.But we also present an algorithm with an output-sensitive space consumption and a running time of $O(n^2 \log n)$, which matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic factor even for large $k$.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we describe suitable engineering techniques to improve the practical running times of our algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Finally, we provide an extensive comparative experimental study on generated and real-world data.As a showcase application, we consider preprocessing-based bi-criteria route planning in road networks.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection on graphs plays an important role in many real-world applications.Usually, these data are composed of multiple types (e.g., user information and transaction records for financial data), thus exhibiting view heterogeneity.Therefore, it can be challenging to leverage such multi-view information and learn the graph's contextual information to identify rare anomalies.To tackle this problem, many deep learning-based methods utilize contrastive learning loss as a regularization term to learn good representations.However, many existing contrastive-based methods show that traditional contrastive learning losses fail to consider the semantic information (e.g., class membership information).In addition, we theoretically show that clustering-based contrastive learning also easily leads to a sub-optimal solution.To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an autoencoder-based clustering framework regularized by a similarity-guided contrastive loss to detect anomalous nodes.Specifically, we build a similarity map to help the model learn robust representations without imposing a hard margin constraint between the positive and negative pairs.Theoretically, we show that the proposed similarity-guided loss is a variant of contrastive learning loss, and how it alleviates the issue of unreliable pseudo-labels with the connection to graph spectral clustering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multiple rotation averaging plays a crucial role in computer vision and robotics domains.The conventional optimization-based methods optimize a nonlinear cost function based on certain noise assumptions, while most previous learning-based methods require ground truth labels in the supervised training process.Recognizing the handcrafted noise assumption may not be reasonable in all real-world scenarios, this paper proposes an effective rotation averaging method for mining data patterns in a learning manner while avoiding the requirement of labels.Specifically, we apply deep matrix factorization to directly solve the multiple rotation averaging problem in unconstrained linear space.For deep matrix factorization, we design a neural network model, which is explicitly low-rank and symmetric to better suit the background of multiple rotation averaging.Meanwhile, we utilize a spanning tree-based edge filtering to suppress the influence of rotation outliers.What's more, we also adopt a reweighting scheme and dynamic depth selection strategy to further improve the robustness.Our method synthesizes the merit of both optimization-based and learning-based methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.841</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, workplaces and educational institutes have widely adopted virtual meeting platforms.This has led to a growing interest in analyzing and extracting insights from these meetings, which requires effective detection and tracking of unique individuals.In practice, there is no standardization in video meetings recording layout, and how they are captured across the different platforms and services.This, in turn, creates a challenge in acquiring this data stream and analyzing it in a uniform fashion.Our approach provides a solution to the most general form of video recording, usually consisting of a grid of participants (\cref{fig:videomeeting}) from a single video source with no metadata on participant locations, while using the least amount of constraints and assumptions as to how the data was acquired.Conventional approaches often use YOLO models coupled with tracking algorithms, assuming linear motion trajectories akin to that observed in CCTV footage.However, such assumptions fall short in virtual meetings, where participant video feed window can abruptly change location across the grid.In an organic video meeting setting, participants frequently join and leave, leading to sudden, non-linear movements on the video grid.This disrupts optical flow-based tracking methods that depend on linear motion.Consequently, standard object detection and tracking methods might mistakenly assign multiple participants to the same tracker.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to track and re-identify participants in remote video meetings, by utilizing the spatio-temporal priors arising from the data in our domain.This, in turn, increases tracking capabilities compared to the use of general object tracking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach reduces the error rate by 95% on average compared to YOLO-based tracking methods as a baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a novel probabilistic approach for generating multi-fidelity data while accounting for errors inherent in both low- and high-fidelity data.In this approach a graph Laplacian constructed from the low-fidelity data is used to define a multivariate Gaussian prior density for the coordinates of the true data points.In addition, few high-fidelity data points are used to construct a conjugate likelihood term.Thereafter, Bayes rule is applied to derive an explicit expression for the posterior density which is also multivariate Gaussian.The maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimate of this density is selected to be the optimal multi-fidelity estimate.It is shown that the MAP estimate and the covariance of the posterior density can be determined through the solution of linear systems of equations.Thereafter, two methods, one based on spectral truncation and another based on a low-rank approximation, are developed to solve these equations efficiently.The multi-fidelity approach is tested on a variety of problems in solid and fluid mechanics with data that represents vectors of quantities of interest and discretized spatial fields in one and two dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that by utilizing a small fraction of high-fidelity data, the multi-fidelity approach can significantly improve the accuracy of a large collection of low-fidelity data points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph neural networks have become the default choice by practitioners for graph learning tasks such as graph classification and node classification.Nevertheless, popular graph neural network models still struggle to capture higher-order information, i.e., information that goes \emph{beyond} pairwise interactions.Recent work has shown that persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, can enrich graph neural networks with topological information that they otherwise could not capture.Calculating such features is efficient for dimension 0 (connected components) and dimension 1 (cycles).However, when it comes to higher-order structures, it does not scale well, with a complexity of $O(n^d)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d$ is the order of the structures.In this work, we introduce a novel method that extracts information about higher-order structures in the graph while still using the efficient low-dimensional persistent homology algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On standard benchmark datasets, we show that our method can lead to up to $31\%$ improvements in test accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning.However, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge since: (i) most benchmarks are limited to specific modalities or domains (e.g. text-only, web navigation, Q&A, coding) and (ii) full benchmark evaluations are slow (on order of magnitude of days) given the multi-step sequential nature of tasks.To address these challenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general environment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where agents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range of applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving tasks.We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse Windows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in planning, screen understanding, and tool usage.Our benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes.To demonstrate Windows Agent Arena's capabilities, we also introduce a new multi-modal agent, Navi.Our agent achieves a success rate of 19.5% in the Windows domain, compared to 74.5% performance of an unassisted human.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Navi also demonstrates strong performance on another popular web-based benchmark, Mind2Web. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>We offer extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of Navi's performance, and provide insights into the opportunities for future research in agent development and data generation using Windows Agent Arena.

                  <p>The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of new models and ways to process users data.The majority of work that has been done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches.However, with the emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique advantages in certain domains or applications.One of these domains is Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance.Due to its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under personalized conditions.In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class.In this way, clustering can benefit from two key advantages.Firstly, clients share only what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been enough during the training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Secondly, by sharing only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication cost.The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) have undergone remarkable development and are increasingly employed in safety-critical applications.However, recently reported data on fatal accidents involving ADSs suggests that the desired level of safety has not yet been fully achieved.Consequently, there is a growing need for more comprehensive and targeted testing approaches to ensure safe driving.Scenarios from real-world accident reports provide valuable resources for ADS testing, including critical scenarios and high-quality seeds.However, existing scenario reconstruction methods from accident reports often exhibit limited accuracy in information extraction.Moreover, due to the diversity and complexity of road environments, matching current accident information with the simulation map data for reconstruction poses significant challenges.In this paper, we design and implement SoVAR, a tool for automatically generating road-generalizable scenarios from accident reports.SoVAR utilizes well-designed prompts with linguistic patterns to guide the large language model in extracting accident information from textual data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, it formulates and solves accident-related constraints in conjunction with the extracted accident information to generate accident trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span>Finally, SoVAR reconstructs accident scenarios on various map structures and converts them into test scenarios to evaluate its capability to detect defects in industrial ADSs.We experiment with SoVAR, using accident reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's database to generate test scenarios for the industrial-grade ADS Apollo.The experimental findings demonstrate that SoVAR can effectively generate generalized accident scenarios across different road structures.Furthermore, the results confirm that SoVAR identified 5 distinct safety violation types that contributed to the crash of Baidu Apollo.</p>

                  <p>Precise and timely forecasting of blood glucose levels is essential for effective diabetes management.While extensive research has been conducted on Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneity, underscoring the need for specialized blood glucose forecasting systems.This study introduces a novel blood glucose forecasting system, applied to a dataset of 100 patients from the ShanghaiT2DM study.Our study uniquely integrates knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, leveraging expert knowledge to validate and interpret the relationships among diabetes-related variables and deploying the data-driven approach to provide accurate forecast blood glucose levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Bayesian network approach facilitates the analysis of dependencies among various diabetes-related variables, thus enabling the inference of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) trajectories in similar individuals with T2DM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>By incorporating past CGM data including inference CGM trajectories, dietary records, and individual-specific information, the Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model effectively forecasts glucose levels across time intervals ranging from 15 to 60 minutes.Forecast results show a mean absolute error of 6.41 mg/dL, a root mean square error of 8.29 mg/dL, and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.28%, for a 15-minute prediction horizon.This study makes the first application of the ShanghaiT2DM dataset for glucose level forecasting, considering the influences of diabetes-related variables.Its findings establish a foundational framework for developing personalized diabetes management strategies, potentially enhancing diabetes care through more accurate and timely interventions.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an effective method for exploiting unlabelled data to learn a high-level embedding space that can be used for various downstream tasks.However, existing methods to monitor the quality of the encoder -- either during training for one model or to compare several trained models -- still rely on access to annotated data.When SSL methodologies are applied to new data domains, a sufficiently large labelled dataset may not always be available.In this study, we propose several evaluation metrics which can be applied on the embeddings of unlabelled data and investigate their viability by comparing them to linear probe accuracy (a common metric which utilizes an annotated dataset).In particular, we apply $k$-means clustering and measure the clustering quality with the silhouette score and clustering agreement.We also measure the entropy of the embedding distribution.We find that while the clusters did correspond better to the ground truth annotations as training of the network progressed, label-free clustering metrics correlated with the linear probe accuracy only when training with SSL methods SimCLR and MoCo-v2, but not with SimSiam.Additionally, although entropy did not always have strong correlations with LP accuracy, this appears to be due to instability arising from early training, with the metric stabilizing and becoming more reliable at later stages of learning.Furthermore, while entropy generally decreases as learning progresses, this trend reverses for SimSiam.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More research is required to establish the cause for this unexpected behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Lastly, we find that while clustering based approaches are likely only viable for same-architecture comparisons, entropy may be architecture-independent.</p>

                  <p>Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks.Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive.We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.   The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination.The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination.We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models.Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.   We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models.Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training.On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours.Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</p>

                  <p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code.Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved.To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews.Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation.Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture.However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training.This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback.To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality.Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function.Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour.Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions.For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data.Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the Gaussian derivative networks achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks.   We first experimentally demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales.Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties.We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation.   In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of Gaussian derivative networks, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have very good explainability properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Images captured from a long distance suffer from dynamic image distortion due to turbulent flow of air cells with random temperatures, and thus refractive indices.This phenomenon, known as image dancing, is commonly characterized by its refractive-index structure constant $C_n^2$ as a measure of the turbulence strength.For many applications such as atmospheric forecast model, long-range/astronomy imaging, and aviation safety, optical communication technology, $C_n^2$ estimation is critical for accurately sensing the turbulent environment.Previous methods for $C_n^2$ estimation include estimation from meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind shear, etc.)for single-point measurements, two-ended pathlength measurements from optical scintillometer for path-averaged $C_n^2$, and more recently estimating $C_n^2$ from passive video cameras for low cost and hardware complexity.In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of classical image gradient methods for $C_n^2$ estimation and modern deep learning-based methods leveraging convolutional neural networks.To enable this, we collect a dataset of video capture along with reference scintillometer measurements for ground truth, and we release this unique dataset to the scientific community.We observe that deep learning methods can achieve higher accuracy when trained on similar data, but suffer from generalization errors to other, unseen imagery as compared to classical methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this trade-off, we present a novel physics-based network architecture that combines learned convolutional layers with a differentiable image gradient method that maintains high accuracy while being generalizable across image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

We propose a new signature called Time Valid Probabilistic Data Structure HORS (TVPD-HORS) that achieves significantly lower end-to-end delay with a tunable PQ-security for real-time applications.We harness special probabilistic data structures as an efficient one-way function at the heart of our novelty, thereby vastly fastening HORS as a primitive for NIST PQ cryptography standards.TVPD-HORS permits tunable and fast processing for varying input sizes via One-hash Bloom Filter, excelling in time valid cases, wherein authentication with shorter security parameters is used for short-lived yet safety-critical messages.We show that TVPD-HORS verification is 2.7x and 5x faster than HORS in high-security and time valid settings, respectively.TVPD-HORS key generation is also faster, with a similar signing speed to HORS.Moreover, TVPD-HORS can increase the speed of HORS variants over a magnitude of time.These features make TVPD-HORS an ideal primitive to raise high-speed time valid versions of PQ-safe standards like XMSS and SPHINCS+, paving the way for real-time authentication of next-generation networks.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, urban safety has become a paramount concern for city planners and law enforcement agencies.Accurate prediction of likely crime occurrences can significantly enhance preventive measures and resource allocation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, many law enforcement departments lack the tools to analyze and apply advanced AI and ML techniques that can support city planners, watch programs, and safety leaders to take proactive steps towards overall community safety.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.569</span></span>This paper explores the effectiveness of ML techniques to predict spatial and temporal patterns of crimes in urban areas.Leveraging police dispatch call data from San Jose, CA, the research goal is to achieve a high degree of accuracy in categorizing calls into priority levels particularly for more dangerous situations that require an immediate law enforcement response.This categorization is informed by the time, place, and nature of the call.The research steps include data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, implementation, optimization and tuning of different supervised machine learning models and neural networks.The accuracy and precision are examined for different models and features at varying granularity of crime categories and location precision.   The results demonstrate that when compared to a variety of other models, Random Forest classification models are most effective in identifying dangerous situations and their corresponding priority levels with high accuracy (Accuracy = 85%, AUC = 0.92) at a local level while ensuring a minimum amount of false negatives.While further research and data gathering is needed to include other social and economic factors, these results provide valuable insights for law enforcement agencies to optimize resources, develop proactive deployment approaches, and adjust response patterns to enhance overall public safety outcomes in an unbiased way.</p>

                  <p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code.Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved.To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews.Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation.Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture.However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training.This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback.To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality.Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function.Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour.Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns.Nonetheless, the development of a robust deep-learning model for retinal disease diagnosis necessitates a substantial dataset for training.The capacity to generalize effectively on smaller datasets remains a persistent challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scarcity of data presents a significant barrier to the practical implementation of scalable medical AI solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address this issue, we've combined a wide range of data sources to improve performance and generalization to new data by giving it a deeper understanding of the data representation from multi-modal datasets and developed a self-supervised framework based on large language models (LLMs), SwinV2 to gain a deeper understanding of multi-modal dataset representations, enhancing the model's ability to extrapolate to new data for the detection of eye diseases using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.We adopt a two-phase training methodology, self-supervised pre-training, and fine-tuning on a downstream supervised classifier.An ablation study conducted across three datasets employing various encoder backbones, without data fusion, with low data availability setting, and without self-supervised pre-training scenarios, highlights the robustness of our method.Our findings demonstrate consistent performance across these diverse conditions, showcasing superior generalization capabilities compared to the baseline model, ResNet-50.</p>
