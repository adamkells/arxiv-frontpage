                  <p>Remote sensing through unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been increasing in forestry in recent years, along with using machine learning for data processing.Deep learning architectures, extensively applied in natural language and image processing, have recently been extended to the point cloud domain.However, the availability of point cloud datasets for training and testing remains limited.Creating forested environment point cloud datasets is expensive, requires high-precision sensors, and is time-consuming as manual point classification is required.Moreover, forest areas could be inaccessible or dangerous for humans, further complicating data collection.Then, a question arises whether it is possible to use synthetic data to train deep learning networks without the need to rely on large volumes of real forest data.To answer this question, we developed a realistic simulator that procedurally generates synthetic forest scenes.Thanks to this, we have conducted a comparative study of different state-of-the-art point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation.Using created datasets, we determined the feasibility of using synthetic data to train deep learning networks to classify point clouds from real forest datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the simulator and the datasets are released as part of this work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.841</span></span></p>

                  <p>Segment anything model (SAM), a foundation model with superior versatility and generalization across diverse segmentation tasks, has attracted widespread attention in medical imaging.However, it has been proved that SAM would encounter severe performance degradation due to the lack of medical knowledge in training and local feature encoding.Though several SAM-based models have been proposed for tuning SAM in medical imaging, they still suffer from insufficient feature extraction and highly rely on high-quality prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we construct a large CT dataset consisting of 1.1M CT images and 5M masks from public datasets and propose a powerful foundation model SAMCT allowing labor-free prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span>Specifically, based on SAM, SAMCT is further equipped with a U-shaped CNN image encoder, a cross-branch interaction module, and a task-indicator prompt encoder.The U-shaped CNN image encoder works in parallel with the ViT image encoder in SAM to supplement local features.Cross-branch interaction enhances the feature expression capability of the CNN image encoder and the ViT image encoder by exchanging global perception and local features from one to the other.The task-indicator prompt encoder is a plug-and-play component to effortlessly encode task-related indicators into prompt embeddings.In this way, SAMCT can work in an automatic manner in addition to the semi-automatic interactive strategy in SAM.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SAMCT against the state-of-the-art task-specific and SAM-based medical foundation models on various tasks.The code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/xianlin7/SAMCT.</p>

                  <p>With the emergence of vision language models in the medical imaging domain, numerous studies have focused on two dominant research activities: (1) report generation from Chest X-rays (CXR), and (2) synthetic scan generation from text or reports.Despite some research incorporating multi-view CXRs into the generative process, prior patient scans and reports have been generally disregarded.This can inadvertently lead to the leaving out of important medical information, thus affecting generation quality.To address this, we propose TiBiX: Leveraging Temporal information for Bidirectional X-ray and Report Generation.Considering previous scans, our approach facilitates bidirectional generation, primarily addressing two challenging problems: (1) generating the current image from the previous image and current report and (2) generating the current report based on both the previous and current images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we extract and release a curated temporal benchmark dataset derived from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, which focuses on temporal data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Our comprehensive experiments and ablation studies explore the merits of incorporating prior CXRs and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the report generation task.Furthermore, we attain on-par performance with SOTA image generation efforts, thus serving as a new baseline in longitudinal bidirectional CXR-to-report generation.The code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/TiBiX.</p>

                  <p>Currently, text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) can embed hidden features to texts generated by LLMs to facilitate subsequent detection, thus alleviating the problem of misuse of LLMs.Although the current text watermarking algorithms perform well in most high-entropy scenarios, its performance in low-entropy scenarios still needs to be improved.In this work, we proposed that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in the watermark detection process, that is, the weight of each token should be adjusted according to its entropy during watermark detection, rather than setting the weight of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods.Specifically, we proposed an Entropy-based Watermark Detection (EWD) that gives higher-entropy tokens higher weights during watermark detection, so as to better reflect the degree of watermarking.Furthermore, the proposed detection process is training-free and fully automated.%In actual detection, we use a proxy-LLM to calculate the entropy of each token, without the need to use the original LLM.In the experiment, we found that our method can achieve better detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

Objectives:The aim of this study is to evaluate the Mann-Whitney U test on DP-synthetic biomedical data in terms of Type I and Type II errors, in order to establish whether statistical hypothesis testing performed on privacy preserving synthetic data is likely to lead to loss of test's validity or decreased power.   Methods: We evaluate the Mann-Whitney U test on DP-synthetic data generated from real-world data, including a prostate cancer dataset (n=500) and a cardiovascular dataset (n=70 000), as well as on data drawn from two Gaussian distributions.Five different DP-synthetic data generation methods are evaluated, including two basic DP histogram release methods and MWEM, Private-PGM, and DP GAN algorithms.   Conclusion: Most of the tested DP-synthetic data generation methods showed inflated Type I error, especially at privacy budget levels of $\epsilon\leq 1$.This result calls for caution when releasing and analyzing DP-synthetic data: low p-values may be obtained in statistical tests simply as a byproduct of the noise added to protect privacy.A DP smoothed histogram-based synthetic data generation method was shown to produce valid Type I error for all privacy levels tested but required a large original dataset size and a modest privacy budget ($\epsilon\geq 5$) in order to have reasonable Type II error levels.</p>

                  <p>In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing private data.In semantic segmentation, the Federated source Free Domain Adaptation (FFreeDA) setting is of particular interest, where clients undergo unsupervised training after supervised pretraining at the server side.While few recent works address FL for autonomous vehicles, intrinsic real-world challenges such as the presence of adverse weather conditions and the existence of different autonomous agents are still unexplored.To bridge this gap, we address both problems and introduce a new federated semantic segmentation setting where both car and drone clients co-exist and collaborate.Specifically, we propose a novel approach for this setting which exploits a batch-norm weather-aware strategy to dynamically adapt the model to the different weather conditions, while hyperbolic space prototypes are used to align the heterogeneous client representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we introduce FLYAWARE, the first semantic segmentation dataset with adverse weather data for aerial vehicles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bounding boxes uniquely characterize object detection, where a good detector gives accurate bounding boxes of categories of interest.However, in the real-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find out whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the detector generalization ability.In this work, we find under feature map dropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not change much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable position changes.We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect this stability.Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of bounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout.To obtain BoS score, we use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets and compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test set.We contribute to finding that BoS score has a strong, positive correlation with detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various test environments.This relationship allows us to predict the accuracy of detectors on various real-world test sets without accessing test ground truths, verified on canonical detection tasks such as vehicle detection and pedestrian detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/YangYangGirl/BoS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>The domain of 3D talking head generation has witnessed significant progress in recent years.A notable challenge in this field consists in blending speech-related motions with expression dynamics, which is primarily caused by the lack of comprehensive 3D datasets that combine diversity in spoken sentences with a variety of facial expressions.Whereas literature works attempted to exploit 2D video data and parametric 3D models as a workaround, these still show limitations when jointly modeling the two motions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we address this problem from a different perspective, and propose an innovative data-driven technique that we used for creating a synthetic dataset, called EmoVOCA, obtained by combining a collection of inexpressive 3D talking heads and a set of 3D expressive sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>To demonstrate the advantages of this approach, and the quality of the dataset, we then designed and trained an emotional 3D talking head generator that accepts a 3D face, an audio file, an emotion label, and an intensity value as inputs, and learns to animate the audio-synchronized lip movements with expressive traits of the face.Comprehensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, using our data and generator evidence superior ability in synthesizing convincing animations, when compared with the best performing methods in the literature.Our code and pre-trained model will be made available.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency.Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset.We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context.Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.</p>

                  <p>Keypoint detection and tracking in traditional image frames are often compromised by image quality issues such as motion blur and extreme lighting conditions.Event cameras offer potential solutions to these challenges by virtue of their high temporal resolution and high dynamic range.However, they have limited performance in practical applications due to their inherent noise in event data.This paper advocates fusing the complementary information from image frames and event streams to achieve more robust keypoint detection and tracking.Specifically, we propose a novel keypoint detection network that fuses the textural and structural information from image frames with the high-temporal-resolution motion information from event streams, namely FE-DeTr.The network leverages a temporal response consistency for supervision, ensuring stable and efficient keypoint detection.Moreover, we use a spatio-temporal nearest-neighbor search strategy for robust keypoint tracking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on a new dataset featuring both image frames and event data captured under extreme conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>The experimental results confirm the superior performance of our method over both existing frame-based and event-based methods.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks is crucial, especially in critical domains like healthcare where significant financial interests heighten the risk of such attacks.Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, digitized versions of tissue samples mounted on glass slides, scanned using sophisticated imaging equipment.The digital analysis of WSIs presents unique challenges due to their gigapixel size and multi-resolution storage format.In this work, we aim at improving the robustness of cancer Gleason grading classification systems against adversarial attacks, addressing challenges at both the image and graph levels.As regards the proposed algorithm, we develop a novel and innovative graph-based model which utilizes GNN to extract features from the graph representation of WSIs.A denoising module, along with a pooling layer is incorporated to manage the impact of adversarial attacks on the WSIs.The process concludes with a transformer module that classifies various grades of prostate cancer based on the processed data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a comparative analysis using two scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Initially, we trained and tested the model without the denoiser using WSIs that had not been exposed to any attack.We then introduced a range of attacks at either the image or graph level and processed them through the proposed network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of accuracy and kappa scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>The results from this comparison showed a significant improvement in cancer diagnosis accuracy, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling adversarial challenges in the context of medical imaging.</p>

                  <p>Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) have emerged as a novel framework for enabling interpretable machine learning algorithms equipped with the ability to reason and explain their decision processes.The basic idea is to represent discrete information through high dimensional random vectors.Complex data structures can be built up with operations over vectors such as the "binding" operation involving element-wise vector multiplication, which associates data together.The reverse task of decomposing the associated elements is a combinatorially hard task, with an exponentially large search space.The main algorithm for performing this search is the resonator network, inspired by Hopfield network-based memory search operations.   In this work, we introduce a new variant of the resonator network, based on self-attention based update rules in the iterative search problem.This update rule, based on the Hopfield network with log-sum-exp energy function and norm-bounded states, is shown to substantially improve the performance and rate of convergence.As a result, our algorithm enables a larger capacity for associative memory, enabling applications in many tasks like perception based pattern recognition, scene decomposition, and object reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We substantiate our algorithm with a thorough evaluation and comparisons to baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span></p>

Afterward, the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are considered to memorize clean data, while the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ are considered to memorize mislabeled data.Benefiting from the memorization effect, the updates of the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are encouraged to fully memorize clean data in early training, and then discouraged with the increase of training epochs to reduce interference of mislabeled data.The updates of the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ are the opposite.In testing, only the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are employed to enhance generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks confirm the superior performance of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and personalized services.Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked interest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data.Yet behavior-based user embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling.As users continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be periodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior patterns.Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack memory of historical behavior.They have to either discard historical data and use only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly.Both cases incur substantial computational overhead.To address this limitation, we introduce User Stateful Embedding (USE).USE generates user embeddings and reflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing by storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.Furthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior prediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting a broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors.By combining it with the Same User Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether different segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further improve the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness.We conducted experiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both static (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically updated user behavior sequences) settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate USE's superior performance over established baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>The results underscore USE's effectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior sequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.</p>

                  <p>Video outpainting is a challenging task, aiming at generating video content outside the viewport of the input video while maintaining inter-frame and intra-frame consistency.Existing methods fall short in either generation quality or flexibility.We introduce MOTIA Mastering VideoOutpainting Through Input-Specific Adaptation, a diffusion-based pipeline that leverages both the intrinsic data-specific patterns of the source video and the image/video generative prior for effective outpainting.MOTIA comprises two main phases: input-specific adaptation and pattern-aware outpainting.The input-specific adaptation phase involves conducting efficient and effective pseudo outpainting learning on the single-shot source video.This process encourages the model to identify and learn patterns within the source video, as well as bridging the gap between standard generative processes and outpainting.The subsequent phase, pattern-aware outpainting, is dedicated to the generalization of these learned patterns to generate outpainting outcomes.Additional strategies including spatial-aware insertion and noise travel are proposed to better leverage the diffusion model's generative prior and the acquired video patterns from source videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations underscore MOTIA's superiority, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in widely recognized benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>Notably, these advancements are achieved without necessitating extensive, task-specific tuning.</p>

                  <p>Released Large Language Models (LLMs) are often paired with a claimed knowledge cutoff date, or the dates at which training data was gathered.Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up to date information.However, this statement only scratches the surface: do all resources in the training data share the same knowledge cutoff date?Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these subsets closely align to their cutoff dates?In this work, we define the notion of an effective cutoff.This is distinct from the LLM designer reported cutoff and applies separately to sub-resources and topics.We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs on the resource-level temporal alignment of an LLM by probing across versions of the data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often differ from reported cutoffs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a direct large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets.Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal biases of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates.Overall, our results show that knowledge cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use information from these models.</p>

                  <p>Human motion prediction is consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences.It is a longstanding challenge due to motion's complex dynamics and uncertainty.Existing methods focus on building up complicated neural networks to model the motion dynamics.The predicted results are required to be strictly similar to the training samples with L2 loss in current training pipeline.However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty property which is crucial to the prediction task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that the recorded motion in training data could be an observation of possible future, rather than a predetermined result. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>In addition, existing works calculate the predicted error on each future frame equally during training, while recent work indicated that different frames could play different roles.In this work, a novel computationally efficient encoder-decoder model with uncertainty consideration is proposed, which could learn proper characteristics for future frames by a dynamic function.Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our uncertainty consideration approach has obvious advantages both in quantity and quality.Moreover, the proposed method could produce motion sequences with much better quality that avoids the intractable shaking artefacts.We believe our work could provide a novel perspective to consider the uncertainty quality for the general motion prediction task and encourage the studies in this field.The code will be available in https://github.com/Motionpre/Adaptive-Salient-Loss-SAGGB.</p>

                  <p>Traditional approaches to neuroevolution often start from scratch.This becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and data requirements when targeting modern, deep neural networks.Using a warm start could be highly advantageous, e.g., using previously trained networks, potentially from different sources.This moreover enables leveraging the benefits of transfer learning (in particular vastly reduced training effort).However, recombining trained networks is non-trivial because architectures and feature representations typically differ.Consequently, a straightforward exchange of layers tends to lead to a performance breakdown.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We overcome this by matching the layers of parent networks based on their connectivity, identifying potential crossover points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>To correct for differing feature representations between these layers we employ stitching, which merges the networks by introducing new layers at crossover points.To train the merged network, only stitching layers need to be considered.New networks can then be created by selecting a subnetwork by choosing which stitching layers to (not) use.Assessing their performance is efficient as only their evaluation on data is required.We experimentally show that our approach enables finding networks that represent novel trade-offs between performance and computational cost, with some even dominating the original networks.</p>

                  <p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from both `seen' and `unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled `seen' class images.A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task.An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model.As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning).Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes.We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods.Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%.The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/sptnet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span></p>
