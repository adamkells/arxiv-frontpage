                  <p>Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is one of the indispensable tasks in human-centered research.However, existing datasets neglect different domains (e.g., environments, times, populations, and data sources), only conducting simple random splits, and the performance of these datasets has already approached saturation.In the past five years, no large-scale dataset has been opened to the public.To address this issue, this paper proposes a new large-scale, cross-domain pedestrian attribute recognition dataset to fill the data gap, termed MSP60K.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It consists of 60,122 images and 57 attribute annotations across eight scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>Synthetic degradation is also conducted to further narrow the gap between the dataset and real-world challenging scenarios.To establish a more rigorous benchmark, we evaluate 17 representative PAR models under both random and cross-domain split protocols on our dataset.Additionally, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) augmented PAR framework, named LLM-PAR.This framework processes pedestrian images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract features and introduces a multi-embedding query Transformer to learn partial-aware features for attribute classification.Significantly, we enhance this framework with LLM for ensemble learning and visual feature augmentation.Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly validated the efficacy of our proposed framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and source code accompanying this paper will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Iris recognition is widely used in high-security scenarios due to its stability and distinctiveness.However, the acquisition of iris images typically requires near-infrared illumination and near-infrared band filters, leading to significant and consistent differences in imaging across devices.This underscores the importance of developing cross-domain capabilities in iris anti-spoofing methods.Despite this need, there is no dataset available that comprehensively evaluates the generalization ability of the iris anti-spoofing task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we propose the IrisGeneral dataset, which includes 10 subsets, belonging to 7 databases, published by 4 institutions, collected with 6 types of devices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>IrisGeneral is designed with three protocols, aimed at evaluating average performance, cross-racial generalization, and cross-device generalization of iris anti-spoofing models.To tackle the challenge of integrating multiple sub-datasets in IrisGeneral, we employ multiple parameter sets to learn from the various subsets.Specifically, we utilize the Mixture of Experts (MoE) to fit complex data distributions using multiple sub-neural networks.To further enhance the generalization capabilities, we introduce a novel method Masked-MoE (MMoE).It randomly masks a portion of tokens for some experts and requires their outputs to be similar to the unmasked experts, which improves the generalization ability and effectively mitigates the overfitting issue produced by MoE. We selected ResNet50, VIT-B/16, CLIP, and FLIP as representative models and benchmarked them on the IrisGeneral dataset.Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMoE with CLIP achieves the best performance on IrisGeneral.</p>

                  <p>From SAE Level 3 of automation onwards, drivers are allowed to engage in activities that are not directly related to driving during their travel.However, in level 3, a misunderstanding of the capabilities of the system might lead drivers to engage in secondary tasks, which could impair their ability to react to challenging traffic situations.   Anticipating driver activity allows for early detection of risky behaviors, to prevent accidents.To be able to predict the driver activity, a Deep Learning network needs to be trained on a dataset.However, the use of datasets based on simulation for training and the migration to real-world data for prediction has proven to be suboptimal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hence, this paper presents a real-world driver activity dataset, openly accessible on IEEE Dataport, which encompasses various activities that occur in autonomous driving scenarios under various illumination and weather conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>Results from the training process showed that the dataset provides an excellent benchmark for implementing models for driver activity recognition.</p>

                  <p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses.Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings.Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD.This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints.We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span>Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting.Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians.Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP.This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p>

                  <p>Robust perception is crucial in autonomous vehicle navigation and localization.Visual processing tasks, like semantic segmentation, should work in varying weather conditions and during different times of day.Semantic segmentation is where each pixel is assigned a class, which is useful for locating overall features (1).Training a segmentation model requires large amounts of data, and the labeling process for segmentation data is especially tedious.Additionally, many large datasets include only images taken in clear weather.This is a problem because training a model exclusively on clear weather data hinders performance in adverse weather conditions like fog or rain.We hypothesize that given a dataset of only clear days images, applying image augmentation (such as random rain, fog, and brightness) during training allows for domain adaptation to diverse weather conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used CARLA, a 3D realistic autonomous vehicle simulator, to collect 1200 images in clear weather composed of 29 classes from 10 different towns (2). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also collected 1200 images of random weather effects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.895</span></span>We trained encoder-decoder UNet models to perform semantic segmentation.Applying augmentations significantly improved segmentation under weathered night conditions (p < 0.001).However, models trained on weather data have significantly lower losses than those trained on augmented data in all conditions except for clear days.This shows there is room for improvement in the domain adaptation approach.Future work should test more types of augmentations and also use real-life images instead of CARLA.Ideally, the augmented model meets or exceeds the performance of the weather model.</p>

                  <p>Nature disasters play a key role in shaping human-urban infrastructure interactions.Effective and efficient response to natural disasters is essential for building resilience and a sustainable urban environment.Two types of information are usually the most necessary and difficult to gather in disaster response.The first information is about disaster damage perception, which shows how badly people think that urban infrastructure has been damaged.The second information is geolocation awareness, which means how people whereabouts are made available.In this paper, we proposed a novel disaster mapping framework, namely CVDisaster, aiming at simultaneously addressing geolocalization and damage perception estimation using cross-view Street-View Imagery (SVI) and Very High-Resolution satellite imagery.CVDisaster consists of two cross-view models, where CVDisaster-Geoloc refers to a cross-view geolocalization model based on a contrastive learning objective with a Siamese ConvNeXt image encoder, and CVDisaster-Est is a cross-view classification model based on a Couple Global Context Vision Transformer (CGCViT).Taking Hurricane IAN as a case study, we evaluate the CVDisaster framework by creating a novel cross-view dataset (CVIAN) and conducting extensive experiments.As a result, we show that CVDisaster can achieve highly competitive performance (over 80% for geolocalization and 75% for damage perception estimation) with even limited fine-tuning efforts, which largely motivates future cross-view models and applications within a broader GeoAI research community.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/tum-bgd/CVDisaster. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains.However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLMs to comprehend and use them effectively.Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLMs' ability to apply them accurately.Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data.This lack of causal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs.To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems.The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules.In the tools module, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with natural language.In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct framework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools.In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs.To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for these four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our methodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80%.For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/Kairong-Han/Causal_Agent.</p>

                  <p>To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention.However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected.Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.   In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages.Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack.We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions.Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.</p>

                  <p>Search and rescue operations require mobile robots to navigate unstructured indoor and outdoor environments.In particular, actively stabilized multirotor drones need precise movement data to balance and avoid obstacles.Combining radial velocities from on-chip radar with MEMS inertial sensing has proven to provide robust, lightweight, and consistent state estimation, even in visually or geometrically degraded environments.Statistical tests robustify these estimators against radar outliers.However, available work with binary outlier filters lacks adaptability to various hardware setups and environments.Other work has predominantly been tested in handheld static environments or automotive contexts.This work introduces a robust baro-radar-inertial odometry (BRIO) m-estimator for quadcopter flights in typical GNSS-denied scenarios.Extensive real-world closed-loop flights in cities and forests demonstrate robustness to moving objects and ghost targets, maintaining a consistent performance with 0.5 % to 3.2 % drift per distance traveled.Benchmarks on public datasets validate the system's generalizability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, dataset, and video are available at https://github.com/ethz-asl/rio. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.945</span></span></p>

This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones.The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</p>

                  <p>Identifying the point of error is imperative in software debugging.Traditional fault localization (FL) techniques rely on executing the program and using the code coverage matrix in tandem with test case results to calculate a suspiciousness score for each function or line.Recently, learning-based FL techniques have harnessed machine learning models to extract meaningful features from the code coverage matrix and improve FL performance.These techniques, however, require compilable source code, existing test cases, and specialized tools for generating the code coverage matrix for each programming language of interest.   In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the privacy funnel, a privacy-utility tradeoff problem in which mutual information quantifies both privacy and utility.The objective is to maximize utility while adhering to a specified privacy budget.However, the privacy funnel represents a non-convex optimization problem, making it challenging to achieve an optimal solution.An existing proposed approach to this problem involves substituting the mutual information with the lift (the exponent of information density) and then solving the optimization.Since mutual information is the expectation of the information density, this substitution overestimates the privacy loss and results in a final smaller bound on the privacy of mutual information than what is allowed in the budget.This significantly compromises the utility.To overcome this limitation, we propose using a privacy measure that is more relaxed than the lift but stricter than mutual information while still allowing the optimization to be efficiently solved.Instead of directly using information density, our proposed measure is the average of information density over the sensitive data distribution for each observed data realization.We then introduce a heuristic algorithm capable of achieving solutions that produce extreme privacy values, which enhances utility.The numerical results confirm improved utility at the same privacy budget compared to existing solutions in the literature.Additionally, we explore two other privacy measures, $\ell_{1}$-norm and strong $\chi^2$-divergence, demonstrating the applicability of our algorithm to these lift-based measures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing its output with previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Finally, we validate our heuristic approach with a theoretical framework that estimates the optimal utility for strong $\chi^2$-divergence, numerically showing a perfect match.</p>

                  <p>Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is one of the indispensable tasks in human-centered research.However, existing datasets neglect different domains (e.g., environments, times, populations, and data sources), only conducting simple random splits, and the performance of these datasets has already approached saturation.In the past five years, no large-scale dataset has been opened to the public.To address this issue, this paper proposes a new large-scale, cross-domain pedestrian attribute recognition dataset to fill the data gap, termed MSP60K.It consists of 60,122 images and 57 attribute annotations across eight scenarios.Synthetic degradation is also conducted to further narrow the gap between the dataset and real-world challenging scenarios.To establish a more rigorous benchmark, we evaluate 17 representative PAR models under both random and cross-domain split protocols on our dataset.Additionally, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) augmented PAR framework, named LLM-PAR.This framework processes pedestrian images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract features and introduces a multi-embedding query Transformer to learn partial-aware features for attribute classification.Significantly, we enhance this framework with LLM for ensemble learning and visual feature augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly validated the efficacy of our proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>The dataset and source code accompanying this paper will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR}.</p>

                  <p>In a real federated learning (FL) system, communication overhead for passing model parameters between the clients and the parameter server (PS) is often a bottleneck.Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) that poses multiple edge servers (ESs) between clients and the PS can partially alleviate communication pressure but still needs the aggregation of model parameters from multiple ESs at the PS.To further reduce communication overhead, we bring sequential FL (SFL) into HFL for the first time, which removes the central PS and enables the model training to be completed only through passing the global model between two adjacent ESs for each iteration, and propose a novel algorithm adaptive to such a combinational framework, referred to as Fed-CHS.Convergence results are derived for strongly convex and non-convex loss functions under various data heterogeneity setups, which show comparable convergence performance with the algorithms for HFL or SFL solely.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results provide evidence of the superiority of our proposed Fed-CHS on both communication overhead saving and test accuracy over baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>Information from social media can provide essential information for emergency response during natural disasters in near real-time.However, it is difficult to identify the disaster-related posts among the large amounts of unstructured data available.Previous methods often use keyword filtering, topic modelling or classification-based techniques to identify such posts.Active Learning (AL) presents a promising sub-field of Machine Learning (ML) that has not been used much in the field of text classification of social media content.This study therefore investigates the potential of AL for identifying disaster-related Tweets.We compare a keyword filtering approach, a RoBERTa model fine-tuned with generic data from CrisisLex, a base RoBERTa model trained with AL and a fine-tuned RoBERTa model trained with AL regarding classification performance.For testing, data from CrisisLex and manually labelled data from the 2021 flood in Germany and the 2023 Chile forest fires were considered.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that generic fine-tuning combined with 10 rounds of AL outperformed all other approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Consequently, a broadly applicable model for the identification of disaster-related Tweets could be trained with very little labelling effort.The model can be applied to use cases beyond this study and provides a useful tool for further research in social media analysis.</p>

                  <p>Long Range - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) is an emerging and promising technology recently introduced into the LoRaWAN protocol specification for both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, notably satellites.The higher capacity, long-range and robustness to Doppler effect make LR-FHSS a primary candidate for direct-to-satellite (DtS) connectivity for enabling Internet-of-things (IoT) in remote areas.The LR-FHSS devices envisioned for DtS IoT will be primarily battery-powered.Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the current consumption characteristics and Time-on-Air (ToA) of LR-FHSS technology.However, to our knowledge, no prior research has presented the accurate ToA and current consumption models for this newly introduced scheme.This paper addresses this shortcoming through extensive field measurements and the development of analytical models.Specifically, we have measured the current consumption and ToA for variable transmit power, message payload, and two new LR-FHSS-based Data Rates (DR8 and DR9).We also develop current consumption and ToA analytical models demonstrating a strong correlation with the measurement results exhibiting a relative error of less than 0.3%.Thus, it confirms the validity of our models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, the existing analytical models exhibit a higher relative error rate of -9.2 to 3.4% compared to our measurement results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>The presented in this paper results can be further used for simulators or in analytical studies to accurately model the on-air time and energy consumption of LR-FHSS devices.</p>

                  <p>In this paper we show how fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can be accelerated using a systolic architecture.We begin by analyzing FHE algorithms and then develop systolic or systolic-esque units for each major kernel.Connecting units is challenging due to the different data access and computational patterns of the kernels.We overcome this by proposing a new data tiling technique that we name limb interleaving.Limb interleaving creates a common data input/output pattern across all kernels that allows the entire architecture, named Osiris, to operate in lockstep.Osiris is capable of processing key-switches, bootstrapping, and full neural network inferences with high utilization across a range of FHE parameters.To achieve high performance, we propose a new giant-step centric (GSC) dataflow that efficiently maps state-of-the-art FHE matrix-vector product algorithms onto Osiris by optimizing for reuse and parallelism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation of Osiris shows it outperforms the prior state-of-the-art accelerator on all standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs.Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings.Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events.This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations.To address this, we propose an innovative causal enhanced graph representation learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR).This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing task performance.Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations.Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning is an efficient framework designed to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple distributed devices while preserving user data privacy.A significant challenge of federated learning is data-level heterogeneity, i.e., skewed or long-tailed distribution of private data.Although various methods have been proposed to address this challenge, most of them assume that the underlying global data is uniformly distributed across all clients.This paper investigates data-level heterogeneity federated learning with a brief review and redefines a more practical and challenging setting called Skewed Heterogeneous Federated Learning (SHFL).Accordingly, we propose a novel Federated Prototype Rectification with Personalization which consists of two parts: Federated Personalization and Federated Prototype Rectification.The former aims to construct balanced decision boundaries between dominant and minority classes based on private data, while the latter exploits both inter-class discrimination and intra-class consistency to rectify empirical prototypes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on three popular benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and achieves balanced performance in both personalization and generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) effectively addresses distribution shifts between training and testing data by adjusting models on test samples, which is crucial for improving model inference in real-world applications.However, traditional TTA methods typically follow a fixed pattern to address the dynamic data patterns (low-diversity or high-diversity patterns) often leading to performance degradation and consequently a decline in Quality of Experience (QoE).The primary issues we observed are:Different scenarios require different normalization methods (e.g., Instance Normalization is optimal in mixed domains but not in static domains).Model fine-tuning can potentially harm the model and waste time.Hence, it is crucial to design strategies for effectively measuring and managing distribution diversity to minimize its negative impact on model performance.Based on these observations, this paper proposes a new general method, named Diversity Adaptive Test-Time Adaptation (DATTA), aimed at improving QoE. DATTA dynamically selects the best batch normalization methods and fine-tuning strategies by leveraging the Diversity Score to differentiate between high and low diversity score batches.It features three key components: Diversity Discrimination (DD) to assess batch diversity, Diversity Adaptive Batch Normalization (DABN) to tailor normalization methods based on DD insights, and Diversity Adaptive Fine-Tuning (DAFT) to selectively fine-tune the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our method achieves up to a 21% increase in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methodologies, indicating that our method maintains good model performance while demonstrating its robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our code will be released soon.</p>

                  <p>During software development, developers often make numerous modifications to the software to address existing issues or implement new features.However, certain changes may inadvertently have a detrimental impact on the overall system performance.To ensure that the performance of new software releases does not degrade, existing practices rely on system-level performance testing, such as load testing, or component-level performance testing to detect performance regressions.However, performance testing for the entire system is often expensive and time-consuming, posing challenges to adapting to the rapid release cycles common in modern DevOps practices.System-level performance testing cannot be conducted until the system is fully built and deployed.On the other hand, component-level testing focuses on isolated components, neglecting overall system performance and the impact of system workloads.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>Human motion prediction is crucial for human-centric multimedia understanding and interacting.Current methods typically rely on ground truth human poses as observed input, which is not practical for real-world scenarios where only raw visual sensor data is available.To implement these methods in practice, a pre-phrase of pose estimation is essential.However, such two-stage approaches often lead to performance degradation due to the accumulation of errors.Moreover, reducing raw visual data to sparse keypoint representations significantly diminishes the density of information, resulting in the loss of fine-grained features.In this paper, we propose \textit{LiDAR-HMP}, the first single-LiDAR-based 3D human motion prediction approach, which receives the raw LiDAR point cloud as input and forecasts future 3D human poses directly.Building upon our novel structure-aware body feature descriptor, LiDAR-HMP adaptively maps the observed motion manifold to future poses and effectively models the spatial-temporal correlations of human motions for further refinement of prediction results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable robustness and efficacy in real-world deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training.We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data.LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs?Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content.Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content.This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment.To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content.We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs.We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better.Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability.Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs.Such data are then used to finetune an LLM.We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level.Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Although access to sufficient screen space is crucial to knowledge work, workers often find themselves with limited access to display infrastructure in remote or public settings.While virtual displays can be used to extend the available screen space through extended reality (XR) head-worn displays (HWD), we must better understand the implications of working with them in public settings from both users' and bystanders' viewpoints.To this end, we conducted two user studies.We first explored the usage of a hybrid AR display across real-world settings and tasks.We focused on how users take advantage of virtual displays and what social and environmental factors impact their usage of the system.A second study investigated the differences between working with a laptop, an AR system, or a VR system in public.We focused on a single location and participants performed a predefined task to enable direct comparisons between the conditions while also gathering data from bystanders.The combined results suggest a positive acceptance of XR technology in public settings and show that virtual displays can be used to accompany existing devices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We highlighted some environmental and social factors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>We saw that previous XR experience and personality can influence how people perceive the use of XR in public.In addition, we confirmed that using XR in public still makes users stand out and that bystanders are curious about the devices, yet have no clear understanding of how they can be used.</p>

                  <p>Recent ethnographic research reveals that gang dynamics in Chicago's Southside have evolved with decentralized micro-gang "set" factions and cross-gang interpersonal networks marking the contemporary landscape.However, standard police datasets lack the depth to analyze gang violence with such granularity.To address this, we employed a natural language processing strategy to analyze text from a Chicago gangs message board.By identifying proper nouns, probabilistically linking them to gang sets, and assuming social connections among names mentioned together, we created a social network dataset of 271 individuals across 11 gang sets.Using Louvain community detection, we found that these individuals often connect with gang-affiliated peers from various gang sets that are physically proximal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that individuals with ties to homicide victims and central positions in the overall gang network were at increased risk of victimization, regardless of gang affiliation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>This research demonstrates that utilizing crowd-sourced information online can enable the study of otherwise inaccessible topics and populations.</p>

                  <p>Extreme Classification (XC) aims to map a query to the most relevant documents from a very large document set.XC algorithms used in real-world applications learn this mapping from datasets curated from implicit feedback, such as user clicks.However, these datasets inevitably suffer from missing labels.In this work, we observe that systematic missing labels lead to missing knowledge, which is critical for accurately modelling relevance between queries and documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We formally show that this absence of knowledge cannot be recovered using existing methods such as propensity weighting and data imputation strategies that solely rely on the training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>While LLMs provide an attractive solution to augment the missing knowledge, leveraging them in applications with low latency requirements and large document sets is challenging.To incorporate missing knowledge at scale, we propose SKIM (Scalable Knowledge Infusion for Missing Labels), an algorithm that leverages a combination of small LM and abundant unstructured meta-data to effectively mitigate the missing label problem.We show the efficacy of our method on large-scale public datasets through exhaustive unbiased evaluation ranging from human annotations to simulations inspired from industrial settings.SKIM outperforms existing methods on Recall@100 by more than 10 absolute points.Additionally, SKIM scales to proprietary query-ad retrieval datasets containing 10 million documents, outperforming contemporary methods by 12% in offline evaluation and increased ad click-yield by 1.23% in an online A/B test conducted on a popular search engine.We release our code, prompts, trained XC models and finetuned SLMs at: https://github.com/bicycleman15/skim</p>

In this essay, we will first introduce the problem of reliable computation from unreliable components and establish the existence of noise thresholds.We will then provide an exposition of von Neumann's result with 3-input majority gates and extend it to minority gates.We will then provide an introduction to SDPIs, which have many applications, including in statistical mechanics, portfolio theory, and lower bounds on statistical estimation under privacy constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will then use the introduced material to provide an exposition of Polyanskiy and Wu's 2017 result on Bayesian networks, from which the 1999 result of Evans-Schulman follows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely adopted offline preference optimization algorithm, aims to align large language models (LLMs) with human-desired behaviors using pairwise preference data.However, the winning response and the losing response within pairwise data are generated isolatedly, leading to weak correlations between them as well as suboptimal alignment performance.To address this issue, we propose an effective framework named BMC, for bridging and modeling correlations in pairwise data.Firstly, we increase the consistency and informativeness of the pairwise preference signals by targeted modifications, synthesizing a pseudo winning response through improving the losing response based on the winning response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we identify that DPO alone is insufficient to model these correlations and capture nuanced variations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Therefore, we propose learning token-level correlations by dynamically leveraging the policy model's confidence during training.Comprehensive experiments on QA, math, and instruction-following tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly surpassing competitive baselines, including DPO.Additionally, our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals the reasons behind our method's superior performance over DPO and showcases its versatility to other DPO variants.</p>

Similarly, we show that using the KL divergence as the operator function also leads to unwanted cancellation of interactions for $d>3$. To characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg information defined on the full partition lattice using generalisations of the KL divergence as operator functions.We validate our results numerically on synthetic data, and illustrate the use of the Streitberg information through applications to stock market returns and neural electrophysiology data.</p>

                  <p>Learning electronic health records (EHRs) has received emerging attention because of its capability to facilitate accurate medical diagnosis.Since the EHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions between entities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice.The EHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, and complexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them.Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning the representations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHR analysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across different tasks.In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHR modeling, namely MulT-EHR (Multi-Task EHR), which leverages a heterogeneous graph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based on the causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects and reduce noise in the EHR data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Additionally, since our model adopts a single graph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design a multi-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularize the training process.Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks -- drug recommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, and readmission.Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of our method upon variations to key components and hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>Human intelligence is characterized by our ability to absorb and apply knowledge from the world around us, especially in rapidly acquiring new concepts from minimal examples, underpinned by prior knowledge.Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to mimic this capacity by enabling significant generalizations and transferability.However, traditional FSL frameworks often rely on assumptions of clean, complete, and static data, conditions that are seldom met in real-world environments.Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world.This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings.We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions.Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.In conclusion, we outline potential future research directions for this evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is our hope that this review will catalyze further development of effective solutions to these complex challenges, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-task learning (MTL) is an inductive transfer mechanism designed to leverage useful information from multiple tasks to improve generalization performance compared to single-task learning.It has been extensively explored in traditional machine learning to address issues such as data sparsity and overfitting in neural networks.In this work, we apply MTL to problems in science and engineering governed by partial differential equations (PDEs).However, implementing MTL in this context is complex, as it requires task-specific modifications to accommodate various scenarios representing different physical processes.To this end, we present a multi-task deep operator network (MT-DeepONet) to learn solutions across various functional forms of source terms in a PDE and multiple geometries in a single concurrent training session.We introduce modifications in the branch network of the vanilla DeepONet to account for various functional forms of a parameterized coefficient in a PDE.Additionally, we handle parameterized geometries by introducing a binary mask in the branch network and incorporating it into the loss term to improve convergence and generalization to new geometry tasks.Our approach is demonstrated on three benchmark problems: (1) learning different functional forms of the source term in the Fisher equation; (2) learning multiple geometries in a 2D Darcy Flow problem and showcasing better transfer learning capabilities to new geometries; and (3) learning 3D parameterized geometries for a heat transfer problem and demonstrate the ability to predict on new but similar geometries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our MT-DeepONet framework offers a novel approach to solving PDE problems in engineering and science under a unified umbrella based on synergistic learning that reduces the overall training cost for neural operators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data-driven scientific discovery requires the iterative integration of scientific domain knowledge, statistical expertise, and an understanding of data semantics to make nuanced analytical decisions, e.g., about which variables, transformations, and statistical models to consider.LM-based agents equipped with planning, memory, and code execution capabilities have the potential to support data-driven science.However, evaluating agents on such open-ended tasks is challenging due to multiple valid approaches, partially correct steps, and different ways to express the same decisions.To address these challenges, we present BLADE, a benchmark to automatically evaluate agents' multifaceted approaches to open-ended research questions.BLADE consists of 12 datasets and research questions drawn from existing scientific literature, with ground truth collected from independent analyses by expert data scientists and researchers.To automatically evaluate agent responses, we developed corresponding computational methods to match different representations of analyses to this ground truth.Though language models possess considerable world knowledge, our evaluation shows that they are often limited to basic analyses.However, agents capable of interacting with the underlying data demonstrate improved, but still non-optimal, diversity in their analytical decision making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work enables the evaluation of agents for data-driven science and provides researchers deeper insights into agents' analysis approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human intelligence is characterized by our ability to absorb and apply knowledge from the world around us, especially in rapidly acquiring new concepts from minimal examples, underpinned by prior knowledge.Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to mimic this capacity by enabling significant generalizations and transferability.However, traditional FSL frameworks often rely on assumptions of clean, complete, and static data, conditions that are seldom met in real-world environments.Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world.This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings.We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions.Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In conclusion, we outline potential future research directions for this evolving field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is our hope that this review will catalyze further development of effective solutions to these complex challenges, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.593</span></span></p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental technique for online advertising recommendation and the complex online competitive auction process also brings many difficulties to CTR optimization.Recent studies have shown that introducing posterior auction information contributes to the performance of CTR prediction.However, existing work doesn't fully capitalize on the benefits of auction information and overlooks the data bias brought by the auction, leading to biased and suboptimal results.To address these limitations, we propose Auction Information Enhanced Framework (AIE) for CTR prediction in online advertising, which delves into the problem of insufficient utilization of auction signals and first reveals the auction bias.Specifically, AIE introduces two pluggable modules, namely Adaptive Market-price Auxiliary Module (AM2) and Bid Calibration Module (BCM), which work collaboratively to excavate the posterior auction signals better and enhance the performance of CTR prediction.Furthermore, the two proposed modules are lightweight, model-agnostic, and friendly to inference latency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on a public dataset and an industrial dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of AIE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>Besides, a one-month online A/B test in a large-scale advertising platform shows that AIE improves the base model by 5.76% and 2.44% in terms of eCPM and CTR, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Crystalline materials, with their symmetrical and periodic structures, possess a diverse array of properties and have been widely used in various fields, e.g., sustainable development.To discover crystalline materials, traditional experimental and computational approaches are often time-consuming and expensive.In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery.Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery.These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and force field development; these tasks are essential for scientific research and development in crystalline materials science.Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic research to summarize their correlations, distinctions, and limitations.To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in deep learning-based material discovery in recent years.We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials.Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in material discovery tasks.We also point out the remaining challenges and propose several future directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The main goal of this review is to offer comprehensive and valuable insights and foster progress in the intersection of artificial intelligence and material science. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>
