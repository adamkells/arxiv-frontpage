                  <p>Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access.These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database.Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models.However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing.This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system.We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models.For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models.We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time.Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments.Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.</p>

                  <p>Exploring and quantifying semantic relatedness is central to representing language.It holds significant implications across various NLP tasks, including offering insights into the capabilities and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).While earlier NLP research primarily focused on semantic similarity, often within the English language context, we instead investigate the broader phenomenon of semantic relatedness.In this paper, we present SemRel, a new semantic relatedness dataset collection annotated by native speakers across 14 languages:Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Punjabi, Spanish, and Telugu.These languages originate from five distinct language families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources.Each instance in the SemRel datasets is a sentence pair associated with a score that represents the degree of semantic textual relatedness between the two sentences.The scores are obtained using a comparative annotation framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe the data collection and annotation processes, related challenges when building the datasets, and their impact and utility in NLP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>We further report experiments for each language and across the different languages.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown remarkable perceptual capability in answering visual questions, however, little is known about the limits of their perception.In particular, while prior works have provided anecdotal evidence of MLLMs' sensitivity to object size, this phenomenon and its underlying causes have not been explored comprehensively.In this work, we quantitatively study the perception of small visual objects in several state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a pervasive limitation in answering questions about small objects in images.Next, we identify four independent factors that can contribute to this limitation -- object quality, size, distractors, and location -- and conduct controlled intervention studies to measure the effect of each factor on MLLMs' perception.In particular, we find that lower object quality and smaller object size can both independently reduce MLLMs' ability to answer visual questions.More surprisingly, we find that the location of the object in the image and the presence of visual distractors can also significantly reduce MLLMs' question answering accuracy.Our study provides a better understanding of the perceptual limitation of MLLMs and contributes new evaluation protocols for analyzing the perception of future MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further investigations, we release our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>To improve language models' proficiency in mathematical reasoning via continual pretraining, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages base language models for autonomous data selection.Departing from conventional supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data, our approach utilizes meta-prompted language models as zero-shot verifiers to autonomously evaluate and select high-quality mathematical content, and we release the curated open-source AutoMathText dataset encompassing over 200GB of data.To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we continuously pretrained a 7B-parameter Mistral language model on the AutoMathText dataset, achieving substantial improvements in downstream performance on the MATH dataset with a token amount reduced by orders of magnitude compared to previous continuous pretraining works.Our method showcases a 2 times increase in pretraining token efficiency compared to baselines, underscoring the potential of our approach in enhancing models' mathematical reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The AutoMathText dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/AutoMathText. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/AutoMathText.</p>

                  <p>Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface.In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph.While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs.In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning.Toward this goal, we first develop our Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks.Then, we propose our G-Retriever approach, which integrates the strengths of GNNs, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting.To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem.Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and resists hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(Our codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever.) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>TikTok is one of the largest and fastest-growing social media sites in the world.TikTok features, however, such as voice transcripts, are often missing and other important features, such as OCR or video descriptions, do not exist.We introduce the Generative AI Enriched TikTok (GET-Tok) data, a pipeline for collecting TikTok videos and enriched data by augmenting the TikTok Research API with generative AI models.As a case study, we collect videos about the attempted coup in Peru initiated by its former President, Pedro Castillo, and its accompanying protests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data includes information on 43,697 videos published from November 20, 2022 to March 1, 2023 (102 days). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>Generative AI augments the collected data via transcripts of TikTok videos, text descriptions of what is shown in the videos, what text is displayed within the video, and the stances expressed in the video.Overall, this pipeline will contribute to a better understanding of online discussion in a multimodal setting with applications of Generative AI, especially outlining the utility of this pipeline in non-English-language social media.Our code used to produce the pipeline is in a public Github repository: https://github.com/gabbypinto/GET-Tok-Peru.</p>

                  <p>The Alqueva Multi-Purpose Project (EFMA) is a massive abduction and storage infrastructure system in the Alentejo, which has a water quality monitoring network with almost thousands of water quality stations distributed across three subsystems: Alqueva, Pedrog\~ao, and Ardila.Identification of pollution sources in complex infrastructure systems, such as the EFMA, requires recognition of water flow direction and delimitation of areas being drained to specific sampling points.The transfer channels in the EFMA infrastructure artificially connect several water bodies that do not share drainage basins, which further complicates the interpretation of water quality data because the water does not flow exclusively downstream and is not restricted to specific basins.   The existing user-friendly GIS tools do not facilitate the exploration and visualisation of water quality data in spatial-temporal dimensions, such as defining temporal relationships between monitoring campaigns, nor do they allow the establishment of topological and hydrological relationships between different sampling points.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This thesis work proposes a framework capable of aggregating many types of information in a GIS environment, visualising large water quality-related datasets and, a graph data model to integrate and relate water quality between monitoring stations and land use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The graph model allows to exploit the relationship between water quality in a watercourse and reservoirs associated with infrastructures.

                  <p>In the era of widespread social networks, the rapid dissemination of fake news has emerged as a significant threat, inflicting detrimental consequences across various dimensions of people's lives.Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively employed for identifying fake news.However, a significant challenge in identifying fake news is the limited availability of labeled news datasets.Therefore, the One-Class Learning (OCL) approach, utilizing only a small set of labeled data from the interest class, can be a suitable approach to address this challenge.On the other hand, representing data as a graph enables access to diverse content and structural information, and label propagation methods on graphs can be effective in predicting node labels.In this paper, we adopt a graph-based model for data representation and introduce a semi-supervised and one-class approach for fake news detection, called LOSS-GAT.Initially, we employ a two-step label propagation algorithm, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an initial classifier to categorize news into two groups: interest (fake) and non-interest (real).Subsequently, we enhance the graph structure using structural augmentation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ultimately, we predict the final labels for all unlabeled data using a GNN that induces randomness within the local neighborhood of nodes through the aggregation function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We evaluate our proposed method on five common datasets and compare the results against a set of baseline models, including both OCL and binary labeled models.The results demonstrate that LOSS-GAT achieves a notable improvement, surpassing 10%, with the advantage of utilizing only a limited set of labeled fake news.Noteworthy, LOSS-GAT even outperforms binary labeled models.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have useful applications in many different tasks, however their performance can be severely affected by changes in the data distribution.For example, in the biomedical field, their performance can be affected by changes in the data (different machines, populations) between training and test datasets.To ensure robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, test-time adaptation has been recently studied as an approach to adjust models to a new data distribution during inference.Test-time batch normalization is a simple and popular method that achieved compelling performance on domain shift benchmarks.It is implemented by recalculating batch normalization statistics on test batches.Prior work has focused on analysis with test data that has the same label distribution as the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in many practical applications this technique is vulnerable to label distribution shifts, sometimes producing catastrophic failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>This presents a risk in applying test time adaptation methods in deployment.We propose to tackle this challenge by only selectively adapting channels in a deep network, minimizing drastic adaptation that is sensitive to label shifts.Our selection scheme is based on two principles that we empirically motivate: (1) later layers of networks are more sensitive to label shift (2) individual features can be sensitive to specific classes.We apply the proposed technique to three classification tasks, including CIFAR10-C, Imagenet-C, and diagnosis of fatty liver, where we explore both covariate and label distribution shifts.We find that our method allows to bring the benefits of TTA while significantly reducing the risk of failure common in other methods, while being robust to choice in hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>The knowledge concept recommendation in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a significant issue that has garnered widespread attention.Existing methods primarily rely on the explicit relations between users and knowledge concepts on the MOOC platforms for recommendation.However, there are numerous implicit relations (e.g., shared interests or same knowledge levels between users) generated within the users' learning activities on the MOOC platforms.Existing methods fail to consider these implicit relations, and these relations themselves are difficult to learn and represent, causing poor performance in knowledge concept recommendation and an inability to meet users' personalized needs.To address this issue, we propose a novel framework based on contrastive learning, which can represent and balance the explicit and implicit relations for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs (CL-KCRec).Specifically, we first construct a MOOCs heterogeneous information network (HIN) by modeling the data from the MOOC platforms.Then, we utilize a relation-updated graph convolutional network and stacked multi-channel graph neural network to represent the explicit and implicit relations in the HIN, respectively.Considering that the quantity of explicit relations is relatively fewer compared to implicit relations in MOOCs, we propose a contrastive learning with prototypical graph to enhance the representations of both relations to capture their fruitful inherent relational knowledge, which can guide the propagation of students' preferences within the HIN.Based on these enhanced representations, to ensure the balanced contribution of both towards the final recommendation, we propose a dual-head attention mechanism for balanced fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that CL-KCRec outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets in terms of HR, NDCG and MRR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access.These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database.Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models.However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing.This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces.Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed.All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system.We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models.For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models.We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time.Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-step forecasting (MSF) in time-series, the ability to make predictions multiple time steps into the future, is fundamental to almost all temporal domains.To make such forecasts, one must assume the recursive complexity of the temporal dynamics.Such assumptions are referred to as the forecasting strategy used to train a predictive model.Previous work shows that it is not clear which forecasting strategy is optimal a priori to evaluating on unseen data.Furthermore, current approaches to MSF use a single (fixed) forecasting strategy.   In this paper, we characterise the instance-level variance of optimal forecasting strategies and propose Dynamic Strategies (DyStrat) for MSF.We experiment using 10 datasets from different scales, domains, and lengths of multi-step horizons.When using a random-forest-based classifier, DyStrat outperforms the best fixed strategy, which is not knowable a priori, 94% of the time, with an average reduction in mean-squared error of 11%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach typically triples the top-1 accuracy compared to current approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>Notably, we show DyStrat generalises well for any MSF task.</p>

                  <p>In the era of widespread social networks, the rapid dissemination of fake news has emerged as a significant threat, inflicting detrimental consequences across various dimensions of people's lives.Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively employed for identifying fake news.However, a significant challenge in identifying fake news is the limited availability of labeled news datasets.Therefore, the One-Class Learning (OCL) approach, utilizing only a small set of labeled data from the interest class, can be a suitable approach to address this challenge.On the other hand, representing data as a graph enables access to diverse content and structural information, and label propagation methods on graphs can be effective in predicting node labels.In this paper, we adopt a graph-based model for data representation and introduce a semi-supervised and one-class approach for fake news detection, called LOSS-GAT.Initially, we employ a two-step label propagation algorithm, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an initial classifier to categorize news into two groups: interest (fake) and non-interest (real).Subsequently, we enhance the graph structure using structural augmentation techniques.Ultimately, we predict the final labels for all unlabeled data using a GNN that induces randomness within the local neighborhood of nodes through the aggregation function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our proposed method on five common datasets and compare the results against a set of baseline models, including both OCL and binary labeled models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>The results demonstrate that LOSS-GAT achieves a notable improvement, surpassing 10%, with the advantage of utilizing only a limited set of labeled fake news.Noteworthy, LOSS-GAT even outperforms binary labeled models.</p>

                  <p>Foundation models have recently expanded into robotics after excelling in computer vision and natural language processing.The models are accessible in two ways: open-source or paid, closed-source options.Users with access to both face a problem when deciding between effective yet costly closed-source models and free but less powerful open-source alternatives.We call it the model selection problem.Existing supervised-learning methods are impractical due to the high cost of collecting extensive training data from closed-source models.Hence, we focus on the online learning setting where algorithms learn while collecting data, eliminating the need for large pre-collected datasets.We thus formulate a user-centric online model selection problem and propose a novel solution that combines an open-source encoder to output context and an online learning algorithm that processes this context.The encoder distills vast data distributions into low-dimensional features, i.e., the context, without additional training.The online learning algorithm aims to maximize a composite reward that includes model performance, execution time, and costs based on the context extracted from the data.It results in an improved trade-off between selecting open-source and closed-source models compared to non-contextual methods, as validated by our theoretical analysis.Experiments across language-based robotic tasks such as Waymo Open Dataset, ALFRED, and Open X-Embodiment demonstrate real-world applications of the solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that the solution significantly improves the task success rate by up to 14%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Exploring and quantifying semantic relatedness is central to representing language.It holds significant implications across various NLP tasks, including offering insights into the capabilities and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).While earlier NLP research primarily focused on semantic similarity, often within the English language context, we instead investigate the broader phenomenon of semantic relatedness.In this paper, we present SemRel, a new semantic relatedness dataset collection annotated by native speakers across 14 languages:Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Punjabi, Spanish, and Telugu.These languages originate from five distinct language families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources.Each instance in the SemRel datasets is a sentence pair associated with a score that represents the degree of semantic textual relatedness between the two sentences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scores are obtained using a comparative annotation framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>We describe the data collection and annotation processes, related challenges when building the datasets, and their impact and utility in NLP.We further report experiments for each language and across the different languages.</p>

We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We then show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class.   On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps).Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.</p>

                  <p>With the development of large language models, multiple AIs are now made available for code generation (such as ChatGPT and StarCoder) and are adopted widely.It is often desirable to know whether a piece of code is generated by AI, and furthermore, which AI is the author.For instance, if a certain version of AI is known to generate vulnerable code, it is particularly important to know the creator.Existing approaches are not satisfactory as watermarking codes are challenging compared with watermarking text data, as codes can be altered with relative ease via widely-used code refactoring methods.In this work, we propose ACW (AI Code Watermarking), a novel method for watermarking AI-generated codes.ACW is efficient as it requires no training or fine-tuning and works in a black-box manner.It is resilient as the watermark cannot be easily removed or tampered through common code refactoring methods.The key idea of ACW is to selectively apply a set of carefully-designed semantic-preserving, idempotent code transformations, whose presence (or absence) allows us to determine the existence of the watermark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that ACW is effective (i.e., achieving high accuracy, true positive rates and false positive rates), resilient and efficient, significantly outperforming existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robots must be able to understand their surroundings to perform complex tasks in challenging environments and many of these complex tasks require estimates of physical properties such as friction or weight.Estimating such properties using learning is challenging due to the large amounts of labelled data required for training and the difficulty of updating these learned models online at run time.To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, multi-modal approach for representing semantic predictions and physical property estimates jointly in a probabilistic manner.By using conjugate pairs, the proposed method enables closed-form Bayesian updates given visual and tactile measurements without requiring additional training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through several hardware experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>In particular, this paper illustrates that by conditioning semantic classifications on physical properties, the proposed method quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art semantic classification methods that rely on vision alone.To further illustrate its utility, the proposed method is used in several applications including to represent affordance-based properties probabilistically and a challenging terrain traversal task using a legged robot.In the latter task, the proposed method represents the coefficient of friction of the terrain probabilistically, which enables the use of an on-line risk-aware planner that switches the legged robot from a dynamic gait to a static, stable gait when the expected value of the coefficient of friction falls below a given threshold.Videos of these case studies are presented in the multimedia attachment.The proposed framework includes an open-source C++ and ROS interface.</p>

                  <p>The need to identify graphs having small structural distance from a query arises in biology, chemistry, recommender systems, and social network analysis.Among several methods to measure inter graph distance, Graph Edit Distance (GED) is preferred for its comprehensibility, yet hindered by the NP-hardness of its computation.State-of-the-art GED approximations predominantly employ neural methods, which, however, (i) lack an explanatory edit path corresponding to the approximated GED; (ii) require the NP-hard generation of ground-truth GEDs for training; and (iii) necessitate separate training on each dataset.In this paper, we propose an efficient algebraic unsuper vised method, EUGENE, that approximates GED and yields edit paths corresponding to the approx imated cost, while eliminating the need for ground truth generation and data-specific training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the aforementioned benefits of EUGENE do not come at the cost of efficacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, EUGENE consistently ranks among the most accurate methods across all of the benchmark datasets and outperforms majority of the neural approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in graphs and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover.We prove, among other things, the following three (tight) conditional lower bounds.\begin{enumerate} \item \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(k^2)} \cdot poly(n)$, nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(k)}$ vertices, unless the \ETH\ fails.\end{enumerate} To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size.\begin{enumerate}[resume] \item \textsc{Test Cover} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(k)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\calF|)$. \end{enumerate} After \textsc{Edge Clique Cover} and \textsc{BiClique Cover}, this is the only example that we know of that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size.\begin{enumerate}[resume] \item \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} (respectively, \textsc{Test Cover}) parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (respectively, of the natural auxiliary graph) does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\tw)}} \cdot poly(n)$ (respectively, $2^{2^{o(\tw)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\calF|))$. \end{enumerate} This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problems that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth.We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also investigate the parameterizations by several other structural graph parameters, answering some open problems from the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic systems are typically composed of various subsystems, such as localization and navigation, each encompassing numerous configurable components (e.g., selecting different planning algorithms).Once an algorithm has been selected for a component, its associated configuration options must be set to the appropriate values.Configuration options across the system stack interact non-trivially.Finding optimal configurations for highly configurable robots to achieve desired performance poses a significant challenge due to the interactions between configuration options across software and hardware that result in an exponentially large and complex configuration space.These challenges are further compounded by the need for transferability between different environments and robotic platforms.Data efficient optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization) have been increasingly employed to automate the tuning of configurable parameters in cyber-physical systems.However, such optimization algorithms converge at later stages, often after exhausting the allocated budget (e.g., optimization steps, allotted time) and lacking transferability.This paper proposes CURE -- a method that identifies causally relevant configuration options, enabling the optimization process to operate in a reduced search space, thereby enabling faster optimization of robot performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CURE abstracts the causal relationships between various configuration options and robot performance objectives by learning a causal model in the source (a low-cost environment such as the Gazebo simulator) and applying the learned knowledge to perform optimization in the target (e.g., Turtlebot 3 physical robot). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>We demonstrate the effectiveness and transferability of CURE by conducting experiments that involve varying degrees of deployment changes in both physical robots and simulation.</p>

                  <p>Fervent calls for more robust governance of the harms associated with artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to the adoption around the world of what regulatory scholars have called a management-based approach to regulation.Recent initiatives in the United States and Europe, as well as the adoption of major self-regulatory standards by the International Organization for Standardization, share in common a core management-based paradigm.These management-based initiatives seek to motivate an increase in human oversight of how AI tools are trained and developed.Refinements and systematization of human-guided training techniques will thus be needed to fit within this emerging era of management-based regulatory paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If taken seriously, human-guided training can alleviate some of the technical and ethical pressures on AI, boosting AI performance with human intuition as well as better addressing the needs for fairness and effective explainability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>In this paper, we discuss the connection between the emerging management-based regulatory frameworks governing AI and the need for human oversight during training.We broadly cover some of the technical components involved in human-guided training and then argue that the kinds of high-stakes use cases for AI that appear of most concern to regulators should lean more on human-guided training than on data-only training.We hope to foster a discussion between legal scholars and computer scientists involving how to govern a domain of technology that is vast, heterogenous, and dynamic in its applications and risks.</p>

We consider several problems to demonstrate the performance of the framework in learning both static and time-dependent PDEs on non-rigid geometries; these include solving the Laplace equation, reaction-diffusion equations, and a multiscale PDE that characterizes the electrical propagation on the left ventricle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work paves the way toward the fast prediction of PDE solutions on a family of domains and the application of neural operators in engineering and precision medicine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

Empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trigger detection and detection-evading attack strategy.For trigger detection, our distribution discrepancy-based solution can achieve a 100\% detection rate for the Trojan triggers used in the existing works.For evading trigger detection, our proposed stealthy trigger design approach performs end-to-end learning to make the distribution of poisoned noise input approach that of benign noise, enabling nearly 100\% detection pass rate with very high attack and benign performance for the backdoored diffusion models.</p>

                PIVOT: Iterative Visual Prompting Elicits Actionable Knowledge for VLMs

                  <p>Vision language models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, from logical reasoning to visual understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This opens the door to richer interaction with the world, for example robotic control. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>However, VLMs produce only textual outputs, while robotic control and other spatial tasks require outputting continuous coordinates, actions, or trajectories.How can we enable VLMs to handle such settings without fine-tuning on task-specific data?   In this paper, we propose a novel visual prompting approach for VLMs that we call Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization (PIVOT), which casts tasks as iterative visual question answering.In each iteration, the image is annotated with a visual representation of proposals that the VLM can refer to (e.g., candidate robot actions, localizations, or trajectories).The VLM then selects the best ones for the task.These proposals are iteratively refined, allowing the VLM to eventually zero in on the best available answer.We investigate PIVOT on real-world robotic navigation, real-world manipulation from images, instruction following in simulation, and additional spatial inference tasks such as localization.We find, perhaps surprisingly, that our approach enables zero-shot control of robotic systems without any robot training data, navigation in a variety of environments, and other capabilities.Although current performance is far from perfect, our work highlights potentials and limitations of this new regime and shows a promising approach for Internet-Scale VLMs in robotic and spatial reasoning domains.Website: pivot-prompt.github.io and HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/spaces/pivot-prompt/pivot-prompt-demo.</p>
