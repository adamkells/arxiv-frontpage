                  <p>Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods principally deploy the ImageNet-1K dataset for model initialization, which inevitably results in sub-optimal situations due to the large domain gap.One of the key challenges is that building large-scale person Re-ID datasets is time-consuming.Some previous efforts address this problem by collecting person images from the internet e.g., LUPerson, but it struggles to learn from unlabeled, uncontrollable, and noisy data.In this paper, we present a novel paradigm Diffusion-ReID to efficiently augment and generate diverse images based on known identities without requiring any cost of data collection and annotation.Technically, this paradigm unfolds in two stages: generation and filtering.During the generation stage, we propose Language Prompts Enhancement (LPE) to ensure the ID consistency between the input image sequence and the generated images.In the diffusion process, we propose a Diversity Injection (DI) module to increase attribute diversity.In order to make the generated data have higher quality, we apply a Re-ID confidence threshold filter to further remove the low-quality images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Benefiting from our proposed paradigm, we first create a new large-scale person Re-ID dataset Diff-Person, which consists of over 777K images from 5,183 identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span>Next, we build a stronger person Re-ID backbone pre-trained on our Diff-Person.Extensive experiments are conducted on four person Re-ID benchmarks in six widely used settings.Compared with other pre-training and self-supervised competitors, our approach shows significant superiority.</p>

                  <p>Modern alignment techniques based on human preferences, such as RLHF and DPO, typically employ divergence regularization relative to the reference model to ensure training stability.However, this often limits the flexibility of models during alignment, especially when there is a clear distributional discrepancy between the preference data and the reference model.In this paper, we focus on the alignment of recent text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), and find that this "reference mismatch" is indeed a significant problem in aligning these models due to the unstructured nature of visual modalities: e.g., a preference for a particular stylistic aspect can easily induce such a discrepancy.Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel and memory-friendly preference alignment method for diffusion models that does not depend on any reference model, coined margin-aware preference optimization (MaPO).MaPO jointly maximizes the likelihood margin between the preferred and dispreferred image sets and the likelihood of the preferred sets, simultaneously learning general stylistic features and preferences.For evaluation, we introduce two new pairwise preference datasets, which comprise self-generated image pairs from SDXL, Pick-Style and Pick-Safety, simulating diverse scenarios of reference mismatch.Our experiments validate that MaPO can significantly improve alignment on Pick-Style and Pick-Safety and general preference alignment when used with Pick-a-Pic v2, surpassing the base SDXL and other existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, models, and datasets are publicly available via https://mapo-t2i.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images.This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images.While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing.However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts.We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements.We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</p>

                  <p>In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner.However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community.For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route.Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.   To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 10000 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations.We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions.</p>

                  <p>Layout generation is the keystone in achieving automated graphic design, requiring arranging the position and size of various multi-modal design elements in a visually pleasing and constraint-following manner.Previous approaches are either inefficient for large-scale applications or lack flexibility for varying design requirements.Our research introduces a unified framework for automated graphic layout generation, leveraging the multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to accommodate diverse design tasks.In contrast, our data-driven method employs structured text (JSON format) and visual instruction tuning to generate layouts under specific visual and textual constraints, including user-defined natural language specifications.We conducted extensive experiments and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public multi-modal layout generation benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.Moreover, recognizing existing datasets' limitations in capturing the complexity of real-world graphic designs, we propose two new datasets for much more challenging tasks (user-constrained generation and complicated poster), further validating our model's utility in real-life settings.Marking by its superior accessibility and adaptability, this approach further automates large-scale graphic design tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be publicly available on https://github.com/posterllava/PosterLLaVA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.906</span></span></p>

                  <p>Lidar has become a cornerstone sensing modality for 3D vision, especially for large outdoor scenarios and autonomous driving.Conventional lidar sensors are capable of providing centimeter-accurate distance information by emitting laser pulses into a scene and measuring the time-of-flight (ToF) of the reflection.However, the polarization of the received light that depends on the surface orientation and material properties is usually not considered.As such, the polarization modality has the potential to improve scene reconstruction beyond distance measurements.In this work, we introduce a novel long-range polarization wavefront lidar sensor (PolLidar) that modulates the polarization of the emitted and received light.Departing from conventional lidar sensors, PolLidar allows access to the raw time-resolved polarimetric wavefronts.We leverage polarimetric wavefronts to estimate normals, distance, and material properties in outdoor scenarios with a novel learned reconstruction method.To train and evaluate the method, we introduce a simulated and real-world long-range dataset with paired raw lidar data, ground truth distance, and normal maps.We find that the proposed method improves normal and distance reconstruction by 53\% mean angular error and 41\% mean absolute error compared to existing shape-from-polarization (SfP) andToF methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are open-sourced at https://light.princeton.edu/pollidar. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span></p>

                  <p>Due to the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent works have focused on employing MLLM-based agents for autonomous driving in large-scale and dynamic environments.However, prevalent approaches often directly translate high-level instructions into low-level vehicle control signals, which deviates from the inherent language generation paradigm of MLLMs and fails to fully harness their emergent powers.As a result, the generalizability of these methods is highly restricted by autonomous driving datasets used during fine-tuning.To tackle this challenge, we propose to connect high-level instructions and low-level control signals with mid-level language-driven commands, which are more fine-grained than high-level instructions but more universal and explainable than control signals, and thus can effectively bridge the gap in between.We implement this idea through a hierarchical multi-agent driving system named AD-H, including a MLLM planner for high-level reasoning and a lightweight controller for low-level execution.The hierarchical design liberates the MLLM from low-level control signal decoding and therefore fully releases their emergent capability in high-level perception, reasoning, and planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build a new dataset with action hierarchy annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Comprehensive closed-loop evaluations demonstrate several key advantages of our proposed AD-H system.First, AD-H can notably outperform state-of-the-art methods in achieving exceptional driving performance, even exhibiting self-correction capabilities during vehicle operation, a scenario not encountered in the training dataset.Second, AD-H demonstrates superior generalization under long-horizon instructions and novel environmental conditions, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/zhangzaibin/AD-H <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span></p>

                  <p>To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as conscious agents with generalizable reasoning capabilities, it is crucial that they possess the reasoning ability to comprehend situational changes (transitions) in distribution triggered by environmental factors or actions from other agents.Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with situational transitions.Addressing these gaps, we propose a novel formulation of reasoning with distributional changes as a three-step discriminative process, termed as MetAphysical ReaSoning.We then introduce the first-ever benchmark, MARS, comprising three tasks corresponding to each step.These tasks systematically assess LLMs' capabilities in reasoning the plausibility of (i) changes in actions, (ii) states caused by changed actions, and (iii) situational transitions driven by changes in action.Extensive evaluations with 20 (L)LMs of varying sizes and methods indicate that all three tasks in this process pose significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art LLMs and LMs after fine-tuning.Further analyses reveal potential causes for the underperformance of LLMs and demonstrate that pre-training them on large-scale conceptualization taxonomies can potentially enhance their metaphysical reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MARS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods principally deploy the ImageNet-1K dataset for model initialization, which inevitably results in sub-optimal situations due to the large domain gap.One of the key challenges is that building large-scale person Re-ID datasets is time-consuming.Some previous efforts address this problem by collecting person images from the internet e.g., LUPerson, but it struggles to learn from unlabeled, uncontrollable, and noisy data.In this paper, we present a novel paradigm Diffusion-ReID to efficiently augment and generate diverse images based on known identities without requiring any cost of data collection and annotation.Technically, this paradigm unfolds in two stages: generation and filtering.During the generation stage, we propose Language Prompts Enhancement (LPE) to ensure the ID consistency between the input image sequence and the generated images.In the diffusion process, we propose a Diversity Injection (DI) module to increase attribute diversity.In order to make the generated data have higher quality, we apply a Re-ID confidence threshold filter to further remove the low-quality images.Benefiting from our proposed paradigm, we first create a new large-scale person Re-ID dataset Diff-Person, which consists of over 777K images from 5,183 identities.Next, we build a stronger person Re-ID backbone pre-trained on our Diff-Person.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on four person Re-ID benchmarks in six widely used settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Compared with other pre-training and self-supervised competitors, our approach shows significant superiority.</p>

                  <p>Text-guided video prediction (TVP) involves predicting the motion of future frames from the initial frame according to an instruction, which has wide applications in virtual reality, robotics, and content creation.Previous TVP methods make significant breakthroughs by adapting Stable Diffusion for this task.However, they struggle with frame consistency and temporal stability primarily due to the limited scale of video datasets.We observe that pretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good priors for video dynamics but they lack textual control.Hence, transferring Image2Video models to leverage their video dynamic priors while injecting instruction control to generate controllable videos is both a meaningful and challenging task.To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to predict future video states based on initial frames and text instructions.More specifically, we design a dual query transformer (DQFormer) architecture, which integrates the instructions and frames into the conditional embeddings for future frame prediction.Additionally, we develop Long-Short Term Temporal Adapters and Spatial Adapters that can quickly transfer general video diffusion models to specific scenarios with minimal training costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets: Something Something V2, Epic Kitchen-100, Bridge Data, and UCF-101. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Notably, AID achieves 91.2% and 55.5% FVD improvements on Bridge and SSv2 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.More examples can be found at our website https://chenhsing.github.io/AID.</p>

                  <p>Discrete diffusion models with absorbing processes have shown promise in language modeling.The key quantities to be estimated are the ratios between the marginal probabilities of two transitive states at all timesteps, called the concrete score.In this paper, we reveal that the concrete score in absorbing diffusion can be expressed as conditional probabilities of clean data, multiplied by a time-dependent scalar in an analytic form.Motivated by the finding, we propose reparameterized absorbing discrete diffusion (RADD), a dedicated diffusion model that characterizes the time-independent conditional probabilities.Besides its simplicity, RADD can reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the time-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling interval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, RADD is up to 3.5 times faster while consistently achieving a better performance than the strongest baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Built upon the new factorization of the concrete score, we further prove a surprising result that the exact likelihood of absorbing diffusion can be rewritten to a simple form (named denoising cross-entropy) and then estimated efficiently by the Monte Carlo method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The resulting approach also applies to the original parameterization of the concrete score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>It significantly advances the state-of-the-art discrete diffusion on 5 zero-shot language modeling benchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale.</p>

                  <p>Subspace clustering (SC) algorithms utilize the union of subspaces model to cluster data points according to the subspaces from which they are drawn.To better address separability of subspaces and robustness to noise we propose a wavelet packet (WP) based transform domain subspace clustering.Depending on the number of resolution levels, WP yields several representations instantiated in terms of subbands.The first approach combines original and subband data into one complementary multi-view representation.Afterward, we formulate joint representation learning as a low-rank MERA tensor network approximation problem.That is motivated by the strong representation power of the MERA network to capture complex intra/inter-view dependencies in corresponding self-representation tensor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the second approach, we use a self-stopping computationally efficient method to select the subband with the smallest clustering error on the validation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When existing SC algorithms are applied to the chosen subband, their performance is expected to improve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, both approaches enable the re-use of SC algorithms developed so far. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Improved clustering performance is due to the dual nature of subbands as representations and filters, which is essential for noise suppression.We exemplify the proposed WP domain approach to SC on the MERA tensor network and eight other well-known linear SC algorithms using six well-known image datasets representing faces, digits, and objects.Although WP domain-based SC is a linear method, it achieved clustering performance comparable with some best deep SC algorithms and outperformed many other deep SC algorithms by a significant margin.That is in particular case for the WP MERA SC algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the COIL100 dataset, it achieves an accuracy of 87.45% and outperforms the best deep SC competitor in the amount of 14.75%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep model fusion is an emerging technique that unifies the predictions or parameters of several deep neural networks into a single model in a cost-effective and data-efficient manner.This enables the unified model to take advantage of the original models' strengths, potentially exceeding their performance.Although a variety of deep model fusion techniques have been introduced, their evaluations tend to be inconsistent and often inadequate to validate their effectiveness and robustness against distribution shifts.To address this issue, we introduce FusionBench, which is the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to deep model fusion.FusionBench covers a wide range of tasks, including open-vocabulary image classification, text classification, and text-to-text generation.Each category includes up to eight tasks with corresponding task-specific models, featuring both full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, as well as models of different sizes, to ensure fair and balanced comparisons of various multi-task model fusion techniques across different tasks, model scales, and fine-tuning strategies.We implement and evaluate a broad spectrum of deep model fusion techniques.These techniques range from model ensemble methods, which combine the predictions to improve the overall performance, to model merging, which integrates different models into a single one, and model mixing methods, which upscale or recombine the components of the original models.FusionBench now contains 26 distinct tasks, 74 fine-tuned models, and 16 fusion techniques, and we are committed to consistently expanding the benchmark with more tasks, models, and fusion techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we offer a well-documented set of resources and guidelines to aid researchers in understanding and replicating the benchmark results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>Homepage https://tanganke.github.io/fusion_bench/</p>

                  <p>Pretraining datasets for large language models (LLMs) have grown to trillions of tokens composed of large amounts of CommonCrawl (CC) web scrape along with smaller, domain-specific datasets.It is expensive to understand the impact of these domain-specific datasets on model capabilities as training at large FLOP scales is required to reveal significant changes to difficult and emergent benchmarks.Given the increasing cost of experimenting with pretraining data, how does one determine the optimal balance between the diversity in general web scrapes and the information density of domain specific data?In this work, we show how to leverage the smaller domain specific datasets by upsampling them relative to CC at the end of training to drive performance improvements on difficult benchmarks.This simple technique allows us to improve up to 6.90 pp on MMLU, 8.26 pp on GSM8K, and 6.17 pp on HumanEval relative to the base data mix for a 7B model trained for 1 trillion (T) tokens, thus rivaling Llama-2 (7B)$\unicode{x2014}$a model trained for twice as long.We experiment with ablating the duration of domain upsampling from 5% to 30% of training and find that 10% to 20% percent is optimal for navigating the tradeoff between general language modeling capabilities and targeted benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also use domain upsampling to characterize at scale the utility of individual datasets for improving various benchmarks by removing them during this final phase of training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>This tool opens up the ability to experiment with the impact of different pretraining datasets at scale, but at an order of magnitude lower cost compared to full pretraining runs.</p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the performance of source-domain pretrained models when tested on unknown shifted target domains.Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data.Recently, diffusion-driven TTA methods have demonstrated strong performance by using an unconditional diffusion model, which is also trained on the source domain to transform target data into synthetic data as a source domain projection.This allows the source model to make predictions without weight adaptation.In this paper, we argue that the domains of the source model and the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA methods are not aligned.To adapt the source model to the synthetic domain of the unconditional diffusion model, we introduce a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data.Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset.Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process mitigates the potential domain gap between the conditional and unconditional models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Diffusion-Driven-Test-Time-Adaptation-via-Synthetic-Domain-Alignment.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive Diagnosis~(CD), which leverages students and exercise data to predict students' proficiency levels on different knowledge concepts, is one of fundamental components in Intelligent Education.Due to the scarcity of student-exercise interaction data, most existing methods focus on making the best use of available data, such as exercise content and student information~(e.g., educational context).Despite the great progress, the abuse of student sensitive information has not been paid enough attention.Due to the important position of CD in Intelligent Education, employing sensitive information when making diagnosis predictions will cause serious social issues.Moreover, data-driven neural networks are easily misled by the shortcut between input data and output prediction, exacerbating this problem.Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate the negative impact of sensitive information in CD models.In response, we argue that sensitive attributes of students can also provide useful information, and only the shortcuts directly related to the sensitive information should be eliminated from the diagnosis process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, we employ causal reasoning and design a novel Path-Specific Causal Reasoning Framework (PSCRF) to achieve this goal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>Specifically, we first leverage an encoder to extract features and generate embeddings for general information and sensitive information of students.Then, we design a novel attribute-oriented predictor to decouple the sensitive attributes, in which fairness-related sensitive features will be eliminated and other useful information will be retained.Finally, we designed a multi-factor constraint to ensure the performance of fairness and diagnosis performance simultaneously.Extensive experiments over real-world datasets (e.g., PISA dataset) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSCRF.</p>

                  <p>Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change.Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations.These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections.Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard.However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation.We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training.First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered.Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features.We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.</p>

                  <p>Workloads in data processing clusters are often represented in the form of DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) jobs.Scheduling DAG jobs is challenging.Simple heuristic scheduling algorithms are often adopted in practice in production data centres.There is much room for scheduling performance optimisation for cost saving.Recently, reinforcement learning approaches (like decima) have been attempted to optimise DAG job scheduling and demonstrate clear performance gain in comparison to traditional algorithms.However, reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face their own problems in real-world deployment.In particular, their black-box decision making processes and generalizability in unseen workloads may add a non-trivial burden to the cluster administrators.Moreover, adapting RL models on unseen workloads often requires significant amount of training data, which leaves edge cases run in a sub-optimal mode.To fill the gap, we propose a new method to distill a simple scheduling policy based on observations of the behaviours of a complex deep learning model.The simple model not only provides interpretability of scheduling decisions, but also adaptive to edge cases easily through tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our method achieves high fidelity to the decisions made by deep learning models and outperforms these models when additional heuristics are taken into account. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span></p>

We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms.In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem.For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.</p>

                  <p>Depth first search is a fundamental graph problem having a wide range of applications.For a graph $G=(V,E)$ having $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the DFS tree can be computed in $O(m+n)$ using $O(m)$ space where $m=O(n^2)$.In the streaming environment, most graph problems are studied in the semi-streaming model where several passes (preferably one) are allowed over the input, allowing $O(nk)$ local space for some $k=o(n)$. Trivially, using $O(m)$ space, DFS can be computed in one pass, and using $O(n)$ space, it can be computed in $O(n)$ passes.   Khan and Mehta [STACS19] presented several algorithms allowing trade-offs between space and passes, where $O(nk)$ space results in $O(n/k)$ passes.They also empirically analyzed their algorithm to require only a few passes in practice for even $O(n)$ space.Chang et al.[STACS20] presented an alternate proof for the same and also presented $O(\sqrt{n})$ pass algorithm requiring $O(n~poly\log n)$ space with a finer trade-off between space and passes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, their algorithm uses complex black box algorithms, making it impractical.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>We perform an experimental analysis of the practical semi-streaming DFS algorithms.Our analysis ranges from real graphs to random graphs (uniform and power-law).We also present several heuristics to improve the state-of-the-art algorithms and study their impact.Our heuristics improve state of the art by $40-90\%$, achieving optimal one pass in almost $40-50\%$ cases (improved from zero).In random graphs, they improve from $30-90\%$, again requiring optimal one pass for even very small values of $k$. Overall, our heuristics improved the relatively complex state-of-the-art algorithm significantly, requiring merely two passes in the worst case for random graphs.Additionally, our heuristics made the relatively simpler algorithm practically usable even for very small space bounds, which was impractical earlier.</p>
