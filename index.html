                  <p>Charts provide visual representations of data and are widely used for analyzing information, addressing queries, and conveying insights to others.Various chart-related downstream tasks have emerged recently, such as question-answering and summarization.A common strategy to solve these tasks is to fine-tune various models originally trained on vision tasks language.However, such task-specific models are not capable of solving a wide range of chart-related tasks, constraining their real-world applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these challenges, we introduce ChartInstruct: a novel chart-specific vision-language Instruction-following dataset comprising 191K instructions generated with 71K charts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span>We then present two distinct systems for instruction tuning on such datasets: (1) an end-to-end model that connects a vision encoder for chart understanding with a LLM; and (2) a pipeline model that employs a two-step approach to extract chart data tables and input them into the LLM.In experiments on four downstream tasks, we first show the effectiveness of our model--achieving a new set of state-of-the-art results.Further evaluation shows that our instruction-tuning approach supports a wide array of real-world chart comprehension and reasoning scenarios, thereby expanding the scope and applicability of our models to new kinds of tasks.</p>

                  <p>Enabling efficient and accurate deep neural network (DNN) inference on microcontrollers is non-trivial due to the constrained on-chip resources.Current methodologies primarily focus on compressing larger models yet at the expense of model accuracy.In this paper, we rethink the problem from the inverse perspective by constructing small/weak models directly and improving their accuracy.Thus, we introduce DiTMoS, a novel DNN training and inference framework with a selector-classifiers architecture, where the selector routes each input sample to the appropriate classifier for classification.DiTMoS is grounded on a key insight: a composition of weak models can exhibit high diversity and the union of them can significantly boost the accuracy upper bound.To approach the upper bound, DiTMoS introduces three strategies including diverse training data splitting to increase the classifiers' diversity, adversarial selector-classifiers training to ensure synergistic interactions thereby maximizing their complementarity, and heterogeneous feature aggregation to improve the capacity of classifiers.We further propose a network slicing technique to alleviate the extra memory overhead incurred by feature aggregation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We deploy DiTMoS on the Neucleo STM32F767ZI board and evaluate it based on three time-series datasets for human activity recognition, keywords spotting, and emotion recognition, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>The experiment results manifest that: (a) DiTMoS achieves up to 13.4% accuracy improvement compared to the best baseline; (b) network slicing almost completely eliminates the memory overhead incurred by feature aggregation with a marginal increase of latency.</p>

                  <p>Semantic Segmentation is one of the most challenging vision tasks, usually requiring large amounts of training data with expensive pixel-level annotations.With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zero-shot semantic segmentation while requiring either large scale training or additional image/pixel-level annotations.In this work, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised pretrained vision encoder to align patch features with a pre-trained text encoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models and train our alignment module cost free. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span>We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks.Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pre-trained vision encoder with minimal training.Our module is lightweight, uses foundation models as a sole source of supervision and shows impressive generalization capability from little training data with no annotation.</p>

                  <p>Large Vision Language Models have achieved fine-grained object perception, but the limitation of image resolution remains a significant obstacle to surpass the performance of task-specific experts in complex and dense scenarios.Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, Counting and \etc.To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts.To efficiently scaling up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models.This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details, and significantly improves multimodal perception ability especially for small objects.Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer.It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts and even coordinates.Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize any objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC, phrase grounding, and REG tasks, and outperform expert models in object detection and object counting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data, codes and models will be released at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/Griffon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

More precisely, each $\mathbf{x}_i$ is sampled independently from some distribution $\chi$ on $[-1,1]^n$, and for each $i$ independently, $y_i$ is arbitrary (i.e., an outlier) with probability at most $\rho < 1/2$, and otherwise satisfies $|y_i-p(\mathbf{x}_i)|\leq\sigma$.The goal is to output a polynomial $\hat{p}$, of degree at most $d$ in each variable, within an $\ell_\infty$-distance of at most $O(\sigma)$ from $p$.

We generalize their results to the $n$-variate setting, showing an algorithm that achieves a sample complexity of $O_n(d^n\log d)$, where the hidden constant depends on $n$, if $\chi$ is the $n$-dimensional Chebyshev distribution.The sample complexity is $O_n(d^{2n}\log d)$, if the samples are drawn from the uniform distribution instead.The approximation error is guaranteed to be at most $O(\sigma)$, and the run-time depends on $\log(1/\sigma)$. In the setting where each $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $y_i$ are known up to $N$ bits of precision, the run-time's dependence on $N$ is linear.We also show that our sample complexities are optimal in terms of $d^n$. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to have the run-time be independent of $1/\sigma$, at the cost of a higher sample complexity.</p>

                  <p>Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario.However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy.To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance.Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data.TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients.Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training.Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods.Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content.This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints.Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features.To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design.Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network.This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.923</span></span>Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques.The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Time series data has been demonstrated to be crucial in various research fields.The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network.Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem.This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification.However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain.In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task.Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains.Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms other baselines and learns a condensed synthetic dataset that exhibits desirable characteristics such as conforming to the distribution of the original data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) proficiently allows an agent to tackle novel tasks while solely relying on a static dataset.For precise and efficient task identification, existing OMRL research suggests learning separate task representations that be incorporated with policy input, thus forming a context-based meta-policy.A major approach to train task representations is to adopt contrastive learning using multi-task offline data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset typically encompasses interactions from various policies (i.e., the behavior policies), thus providing a plethora of contextual information regarding different tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Nonetheless, amassing data from a substantial number of policies is not only impractical but also often unattainable in realistic settings.Instead, we resort to a more constrained yet practical scenario, where multi-task data collection occurs with a limited number of policies.We observed that learned task representations from previous OMRL methods tend to correlate spuriously with the behavior policy instead of reflecting the essential characteristics of the task, resulting in unfavorable out-of-distribution generalization.To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm to disentangle the impact of behavior policy from task representation learning through a process called adversarial data augmentation.Specifically, the objective of adversarial data augmentation is not merely to generate data analogous to offline data distribution; instead, it aims to create adversarial examples designed to confound learned task representations and lead to incorrect task identification.Our experiments show that learning from such adversarial samples significantly enhances the robustness and effectiveness of the task identification process and realizes satisfactory out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

                  <p>Event cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors that capture pixel-wise intensity changes and output asynchronous event streams.They show great potential over conventional cameras to handle challenging scenarios in robotics and computer vision, such as high-speed and high dynamic range.This paper considers the problem of rotational motion estimation using event cameras.Several event-based rotation estimation methods have been developed in the past decade, but their performance has not been evaluated and compared under unified criteria yet.In addition, these prior works do not consider a global refinement step.To this end, we conduct a systematic study of this problem with two objectives in mind: summarizing previous works and presenting our own solution.First, we compare prior works both theoretically and experimentally.Second, we propose the first event-based rotation-only bundle adjustment (BA) approach.We formulate it leveraging the state-of-the-art Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework, which is principled and avoids the need to convert events into frames.Third, we use the proposed BA to build CMax-SLAM, the first event-based rotation-only SLAM system comprising a front-end and a back-end.Our BA is able to run both offline (trajectory smoothing) and online (CMax-SLAM back-end).To demonstrate the performance and versatility of our method, we present comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including indoor, outdoor and space scenarios.We discuss the pitfalls of real-world evaluation and propose a proxy for the reprojection error as the figure of merit to evaluate event-based rotation BA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the source code and novel data sequences to benefit the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>We hope this work leads to a better understanding and fosters further research on event-based ego-motion estimation.Project page: https://github.com/tub-rip/cmax_slam</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), also called zero-shot or dataless text classification, has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability in classifying a mass of texts within the dynamic and open Web environment, since it requires only a limited set of seed words (label names) for each category instead of labeled data.With the help of recently popular prompting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), many studies leveraged manually crafted and/or automatically identified verbalizers to estimate the likelihood of categories, but they failed to differentiate the effects of these category-indicative words, let alone capture their correlations and realize adaptive adjustments according to the unlabeled corpus.In this paper, in order to let the PLM effectively understand each category, we at first propose a novel form of rule-based knowledge using logical expressions to characterize the meanings of categories.Then, we develop a prompting PLM-based approach named RulePrompt for the WSTC task, consisting of a rule mining module and a rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module, plus a self-supervised fine-tuning module to make the PLM align with this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, the inaccurate pseudo labels assigned to texts and the imprecise logical rules associated with categories mutually enhance each other in an alternative manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>That establishes a self-iterative closed loop of knowledge (rule) acquisition and utilization, with seed words serving as the starting point.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which markedly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.What is more, our approach yields interpretable category rules, proving its advantage in disambiguating easily-confused categories.</p>

                  <p>While standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training is proven effective for image classification on in-distribution data, it fails to perform well on out-of-distribution samples.One of the main sources of distribution shift for image classification is the compositional nature of images.Specifically, in addition to the main object or component(s) determining the label, some other image components usually exist, which may lead to the shift of input distribution between train and test environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, these components may have spurious correlations with the label. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address this issue, we propose Decompose-and-Compose (DaC), which improves robustness to correlation shift by a compositional approach based on combining elements of images.Based on our observations, models trained with ERM usually highly attend to either the causal components or the components having a high spurious correlation with the label (especially in datapoints on which models have a high confidence).In fact, according to the amount of spurious correlation and the easiness of classification based on the causal or non-causal components, the model usually attends to one of these more (on samples with high confidence).Following this, we first try to identify the causal components of images using class activation maps of models trained with ERM.Afterward, we intervene on images by combining them and retraining the model on the augmented data, including the counterfactual ones.Along with its high interpretability, this work proposes a group-balancing method by intervening on images without requiring group labels or information regarding the spurious features during training.The method has an overall better worst group accuracy compared to previous methods with the same amount of supervision on the group labels in correlation shift.</p>

                  <p>Causal discovery, i.e., learning the causal graph from data, is often the first step toward the identification and estimation of causal effects, a key requirement in numerous scientific domains.Causal discovery is hampered by two main challenges: limited data results in errors in statistical testing and the computational complexity of the learning task is daunting.This paper builds upon and extends four of our prior publications (Mokhtarian et al., 2021; Akbari et al., 2021; Mokhtarian et al., 2022, 2023a).These works introduced the concept of removable variables, which are the only variables that can be removed recursively for the purpose of causal discovery.Presence and identification of removable variables allow recursive approaches for causal discovery, a promising solution that helps to address the aforementioned challenges by reducing the problem size successively.This reduction not only minimizes conditioning sets in each conditional independence (CI) test, leading to fewer errors but also significantly decreases the number of required CI tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The worst-case performances of these methods nearly match the lower bound. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>In this paper, we present a unified framework for the proposed algorithms, refined with additional details and enhancements for a coherent presentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comprehensive literature review is also included, comparing the computational complexity of our methods with existing approaches, showcasing their state-of-the-art efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Another contribution of this paper is the release of RCD, a Python package that efficiently implements these algorithms.This package is designed for practitioners and researchers interested in applying these methods in practical scenarios.The package is available at github.com/ban-epfl/rcd, with comprehensive documentation provided at rcdpackage.com.</p>

                  <p>Medical data often exhibits distribution shifts, which cause test-time performance degradation for deep learning models trained using standard supervised learning pipelines.This challenge is addressed in the field of Domain Generalization (DG) with the sub-field of Single Domain Generalization (SDG) being specifically interesting due to the privacy- or logistics-related issues often associated with medical data.Existing disentanglement-based SDG methods heavily rely on structural information embedded in segmentation masks, however classification labels do not provide such dense information.This work introduces a novel SDG method aimed at medical image classification that leverages channel-wise contrastive disentanglement.It is further enhanced with reconstruction-based style regularization to ensure extraction of distinct style and structure feature representations.We evaluate our method on the complex task of multicenter histopathology image classification, comparing it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) SDG baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA by a margin of 1% in average accuracy while also showing more stable performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>This study highlights the importance and challenges of exploring SDG frameworks in the context of the classification task.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/ConDiSR</p>

                  <p>Identifying highlight moments of raw video materials is crucial for improving the efficiency of editing videos that are pervasive on internet platforms.However, the extensive work of manually labeling footage has created obstacles to applying supervised methods to videos of unseen categories.The absence of an audio modality that contains valuable cues for highlight detection in many videos also makes it difficult to use multimodal strategies.In this paper, we propose a novel model with cross-modal perception for unsupervised highlight detection.The proposed model learns representations with visual-audio level semantics from image-audio pair data via a self-reconstruction task.To achieve unsupervised highlight detection, we investigate the latent representations of the network and propose the representation activation sequence learning (RASL) module with k-point contrastive learning to learn significant representation activations.To connect the visual modality with the audio modality, we use the symmetric contrastive learning (SCL) module to learn the paired visual and audio representations.Furthermore, an auxiliary task of masked feature vector sequence (FVS) reconstruction is simultaneously conducted during pretraining for representation enhancement.During inference, the cross-modal pretrained model can generate representations with paired visual-audio semantics given only the visual modality.The RASL module is used to output the highlight scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods.Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content.This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints.Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features.To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design.Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network.This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features.Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Depth estimation is a fundamental knowledge for autonomous systems that need to assess their own state and perceive the surrounding environment.Deep learning algorithms for depth estimation have gained significant interest in recent years, owing to the potential benefits of this methodology in overcoming the limitations of active depth sensing systems.Moreover, due to the low cost and size of monocular cameras, researchers have focused their attention on monocular depth estimation (MDE), which consists in estimating a dense depth map from a single RGB video frame.State of the art MDE models typically rely on vision transformers (ViT) architectures that are highly deep and complex, making them unsuitable for fast inference on devices with hardware constraints.Purposely, in this paper, we address the problem of exploiting ViT in MDE on embedded devices.Those systems are usually characterized by limited memory capabilities and low-power CPU/GPU.We propose METER, a novel lightweight vision transformer architecture capable of achieving state of the art estimations and low latency inference performances on the considered embedded hardwares: NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and NVIDIA Jetson Nano.We provide a solution consisting of three alternative configurations of METER, a novel loss function to balance pixel estimation and reconstruction of image details, and a new data augmentation strategy to improve the overall final predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method outperforms previous lightweight works over the two benchmark datasets: the indoor NYU Depth v2 and the outdoor KITTI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span></p>

                  <p>Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry due to their capability to operate in extreme weather conditions.However, they face challenges in terms of sparsity and noise interference, which hinder their application in the field of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) autonomous navigation.To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to dense and accurate mmWave radar point cloud construction via cross-modal learning.Specifically, we introduce diffusion models, which possess state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, to predict LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data.We also incorporate the most recent diffusion model inference accelerating techniques to ensure that the proposed method can be implemented on MAVs with limited computing resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the proposed method through extensive benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and generalization ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.893</span></span>Code and pretrained models will be available at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Radar-Diffusion.</p>

                  <p>Authorship Verification (AV) is the process of analyzing a set of documents to determine whether they were written by a specific author.This problem often arises in forensic scenarios, e.g., in cases where the documents in question constitute evidence for a crime.Existing state-of-the-art AV methods use computational solutions that are not supported by a plausible scientific explanation for their functioning and that are often difficult for analysts to interpret.To address this, we propose a method relying on calculating a quantity we call $\lambda_G$ (LambdaG): the ratio between the likelihood of a document given a model of the Grammar for the candidate author and the likelihood of the same document given a model of the Grammar for a reference population.These Grammar Models are estimated using $n$-gram language models that are trained solely on grammatical features.Despite not needing large amounts of data for training, LambdaG still outperforms other established AV methods with higher computational complexity, including a fine-tuned Siamese Transformer network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation based on four baseline methods applied to twelve datasets shows that LambdaG leads to better results in terms of both accuracy and AUC in eleven cases and in all twelve cases if considering only topic-agnostic methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>The algorithm is also highly robust to important variations in the genre of the reference population in many cross-genre comparisons.In addition to these properties, we demonstrate how LambdaG is easier to interpret than the current state-of-the-art.We argue that the advantage of LambdaG over other methods is due to fact that it is compatible with Cognitive Linguistic theories of language processing.</p>

This completely resolves the question of the minimum size of conditioning sets required to learn the graph.When it comes to the number of tests, our upper bound on the sizes of conditioning sets implies that every $n$-vertex graph can be learned by at most $n^{\kappa}$ tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $\kappa$. We show that for any upper bound $q$ on the sizes of the conditioning sets, there exist graphs with $O(n q)$ vertices that require at least $n^{\Omega(\kappa)}$ tests to learn.This lower bound holds even when the treewidth and the maximum degree of the graph are at most $\kappa+2$.

                  <p>Driven by the demand for energy-efficient employment of deep neural networks, early-exit methods have experienced a notable increase in research attention.These strategies allow for swift predictions by making decisions early in the network, thereby conserving computation time and resources.However, so far the early-exit networks have only been developed for stationary data distributions, which restricts their application in real-world scenarios with continuous non-stationary data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study aims to explore the continual learning of the early-exit networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>We adapt existing continual learning methods to fit with early-exit architectures and investigate their behavior in the continual setting.We notice that early network layers exhibit reduced forgetting and can outperform standard networks even when using significantly fewer resources.Furthermore, we analyze the impact of task-recency bias on early-exit inference and propose Task-wise Logits Correction (TLC), a simple method that equalizes this bias and improves the network performance for every given compute budget in the class-incremental setting.We assess the accuracy and computational cost of various continual learning techniques enhanced with early-exits and TLC across standard class-incremental learning benchmarks such as 10 split CIFAR100 and ImageNetSubset and show that TLC can achieve the accuracy of the standard methods using less than 70\% of their computations.Moreover, at full computational budget, our method outperforms the accuracy of the standard counterparts by up to 15 percentage points.Our research underscores the inherent synergy between early-exit networks and continual learning, emphasizing their practical utility in resource-constrained environments.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, there is evidence that several factors may increase the risk, for an infant, to require stabilisation or resuscitation manoeuvres at birth.However, this risk factors are not completely known, and a universally applicable model for predicting high-risk situations is not available yet.Considering both these limitations and the fact that the need for resuscitation at birth is a rare event, periodic training of the healthcare personnel responsible for newborn caring in the delivery room is mandatory.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for identifying risk factors and their impact on the birth event from real data, which can be used by personnel to progressively increase and update their knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.561</span></span>Our final goal will be the one of designing a user-friendly mobile application, able to improve the recognition rate and the planning of the appropriate interventions on high-risk patients.</p>

                  <p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer an agent's preferences (represented as a reward function $R$) from their behaviour (represented as a policy $\pi$).To do this, we need a behavioural model of how $\pi$ relates to $R$. In the current literature, the most common behavioural models are optimality, Boltzmann-rationality, and causal entropy maximisation.However, the true relationship between a human's preferences and their behaviour is much more complex than any of these behavioural models.This means that the behavioural models are misspecified, which raises the concern that they may lead to systematic errors if applied to real data.In this paper, we analyse how sensitive the IRL problem is to misspecification of the behavioural model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that completely characterise how the observed data may differ from the assumed behavioural model without incurring an error above a given threshold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>In addition to this, we also characterise the conditions under which a behavioural model is robust to small perturbations of the observed policy, and we analyse how robust many behavioural models are to misspecification of their parameter values (such as e.g.\ the discount rate).Our analysis suggests that the IRL problem is highly sensitive to misspecification, in the sense that very mild misspecification can lead to very large errors in the inferred reward function.</p>

                  <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, with blood pressure serving as a crucial indicator.Arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms provide continuous pressure measurements throughout the cardiac cycle and offer valuable diagnostic insights.Consequently, there is a significant demand for non-invasive and cuff-less methods to measure ABP waveforms continuously.Accurate prediction of ABP waveforms can also improve the estimation of mean blood pressure, an essential cardiovascular health characteristic.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study proposes a novel framework based on the physics-informed DeepONet approach to predict ABP waveforms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Unlike previous methods, our approach requires the predicted ABP waveforms to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equation with a time-periodic condition and a Windkessel boundary condition.Notably, our framework is the first to predict ABP waveforms continuously, both with location and time, within the part of the artery that is being simulated.Furthermore, our method only requires ground truth data at the outlet boundary and can handle periodic conditions with varying periods.Incorporating the Windkessel boundary condition in our solution allows for generating natural physical reflection waves, which closely resemble measurements observed in real-world cases.Moreover, accurately estimating the hyper-parameters in the Navier-Stokes equation for our simulations poses a significant challenge.To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the concept of meta-learning, enabling the neural networks to learn these parameters during the training process.</p>

                  <p>Recently, the scale of transformers has grown rapidly, which introduces considerable challenges in terms of training overhead and inference efficiency in the scope of task adaptation.Existing works, namely Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and model compression, have separately investigated the challenges.However, PEFT cannot guarantee the inference efficiency of the original backbone, especially for large-scale models.Model compression requires significant training costs for structure searching and re-training.Consequently, a simple combination of them cannot guarantee accomplishing both training efficiency and inference efficiency with minimal costs.In this paper, we propose a novel Parallel Yielding Re-Activation (PYRA) method for such a challenge of training-inference efficient task adaptation.PYRA first utilizes parallel yielding adaptive weights to comprehensively perceive the data distribution in downstream tasks.A re-activation strategy for token modulation is then applied for tokens to be merged, leading to calibrated token features.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PYRA outperforms all competing methods under both low compression rate and high compression rate, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in maintaining both training efficiency and inference efficiency for large-scale foundation models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released to the public. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span></p>

                  <p>Addressing the so-called ``Red-AI'' trend of rising energy consumption by large-scale neural networks, this study investigates the actual energy consumption, as measured by node-level watt-meters, of training various fully connected neural network architectures.We introduce the BUTTER-E dataset, an augmentation to the BUTTER Empirical Deep Learning dataset, containing energy consumption and performance data from 63,527 individual experimental runs spanning 30,582 distinct configurations: 13 datasets, 20 sizes (number of trainable parameters), 8 network ``shapes'', and 14 depths on both CPU and GPU hardware collected using node-level watt-meters.This dataset reveals the complex relationship between dataset size, network structure, and energy use, and highlights the impact of cache effects.We propose a straightforward and effective energy model that accounts for network size, computing, and memory hierarchy.Our analysis also uncovers a surprising, hardware-mediated non-linear relationship between energy efficiency and network design, challenging the assumption that reducing the number of parameters or FLOPs is the best way to achieve greater energy efficiency.Highlighting the need for cache-considerate algorithm development, we suggest a combined approach to energy efficient network, algorithm, and hardware design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work contributes to the fields of sustainable computing and Green AI, offering practical guidance for creating more energy-efficient neural networks and promoting sustainable AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical image classification requires labeled, task-specific datasets which are used to train deep learning networks de novo, or to fine-tune foundation models.However, this process is computationally and technically demanding.In language processing, in-context learning provides an alternative, where models learn from within prompts, bypassing the need for parameter updates.Yet, in-context learning remains underexplored in medical image analysis.Here, we systematically evaluate the model Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 with Vision capabilities (GPT-4V) on cancer image processing with in-context learning on three cancer histopathology tasks of high importance: Classification of tissue subtypes in colorectal cancer, colon polyp subtyping and breast tumor detection in lymph node sections.Our results show that in-context learning is sufficient to match or even outperform specialized neural networks trained for particular tasks, while only requiring a minimal number of samples.In summary, this study demonstrates that large vision language models trained on non-domain specific data can be applied out-of-the box to solve medical image-processing tasks in histopathology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This democratizes access of generalist AI models to medical experts without technical background especially for areas where annotated data is scarce. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose:Over the last few decades, the development of the hardware and software has enabled the application of advanced systems.In the robotics field, the UI design is an intriguing area to be explored due to the creation of devices with a wide range of functionalities in a reduced size.Moreover, the idea of using the same UI to control several systems arouses a great interest considering that this involves less learning effort and time for the users.Therefore, this paper will present a mobile application to control two industrial robots with four modes of operation.Design/methodology/approach: The smartphone was selected to be the interface due to its wide range of capabilities and the MIT Inventor App was used to create the application, whose environment is supported by Android smartphones.For the validation, ROS was used since it is a fundamental framework utilised in industrial robotics and the Arduino Uno was used to establish the data transmission between the smartphone and the board NVIDIA Jetson TX2.In MIT Inventor App, the graphical interface was created to visualize the options available in the app whereas two scripts in python were programmed to perform the simulations in ROS and carry out the tests.Findings:The results indicated that the use of the sliders to control the robots is more favourable than the Orientation Sensor due to the sensibility of the sensor and human limitations to hold the smartphone perfectly still.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Another important finding was the limitations of the autonomous mode, in which the robot grabs an object. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>In this case, the configuration of the Kinect camera and the controllers has a significant impact on the success of the simulation.Finally, it was observed that the delay was appropriate despite the use of the Arduino UNO to transfer the data between the Smartphone and the Nvidia Jetson TX2.</p>

                  <p>The presence of toxic and gender-identity derogatory language in open-source software (OSS) communities has recently become a focal point for researchers.Such comments not only lead to frustration and disengagement among developers but may also influence their leave from the OSS projects.Despite ample evidence suggesting that diverse teams enhance productivity, the existence of toxic or gender identity discriminatory communications poses a significant threat to the participation of individuals from marginalized groups and, as such, may act as a barrier to fostering diversity and inclusion in OSS projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, there is a notable lack of research dedicated to exploring the association between gender-based toxic and derogatory language with a perceptible diversity of open-source software teams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Consequently, this study aims to investigate how such content influences the gender, ethnicity, and tenure diversity of open-source software development teams.To achieve this, we extract data from active GitHub projects, assess various project characteristics, and identify instances of toxic and gender-discriminatory language within issue/pull request comments.Using these attributes, we construct a regression model to explore how they associate with the perceptible diversity of those projects.</p>

                  <p>Privacy policies are expected to inform data subjects about their data protection rights.They should explain the data controller's data management practices, and make facts such as retention periods or data transfers to third parties transparent.Privacy policies only fulfill their purpose, if they are correctly perceived, interpreted, understood, and trusted by the data subject.Amongst others, this requires that a privacy policy is written in a fair way, e.g., it does not use polarizing terms, does not require a certain education, or does not assume a particular social background.In this work-in-progress paper, we outline our approach to assessing fairness in privacy policies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we identify from fundamental legal sources and fairness research, how the dimensions informational fairness, representational fairness and ethics/morality are related to privacy policies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>We propose options to automatically assess policies in these fairness dimensions, based on text statistics, linguistic methods and artificial intelligence.Finally, we conduct initial experiments with German privacy policies to provide evidence that our approach is applicable.Our experiments indicate that there are indeed issues in all three dimensions of fairness.For example, our approach finds out if a policy discriminates against individuals with impaired reading skills or certain demographics, and identifies questionable ethics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is important, as future privacy policies may be used in a corpus for legal artificial intelligence models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>
