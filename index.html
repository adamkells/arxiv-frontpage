                  <p>Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years.Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks.Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other.Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network.The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning.In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges.Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features.The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</p>

                  <p>According to the World Health Organization, the involvement of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) in traffic accidents remains a significant concern, with VRUs accounting for over half of traffic fatalities.The increase of automation and connectivity levels of vehicles has still an uncertain impact on VRU safety.By deploying the Collective Perception Service (CPS), vehicles can include information about VRUs in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) messages, thus raising the general perception of the environment.Although an increased awareness is considered positive, one could argue that the awareness ratio, the metric used to measure perception, is only implicitly connected to the VRUs' safety.This paper introduces a tailored metric, the Risk Factor (RF), to measure the risk level for the interactions between Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and VRUs.By evaluating the RF, we assess the impact of V2X communication on VRU risk mitigation.Our results show that high V2X penetration rates can reduce mean risk, quantified by our proposed metric, by up to 44%.Although the median risk value shows a significant decrease, suggesting a reduction in overall risk, the distribution of risk values reveals that CPS's mitigation effectiveness is overestimated, which is indicated by the divergence between RF and awareness ratio.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, by analyzing a real-world traffic dataset, we pinpoint high-risk locations within a scenario, identifying areas near intersections and behind parked cars as especially dangerous. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>Our methodology can be ported and applied to other scenarios in order to identify high-risk areas.We value the proposed RF as an insightful metric for quantifying VRU safety in a highly automated and connected environment.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on a very important societal challenge of water quality analysis.Being one of the key factors in the economic and social development of society, the provision of water and ensuring its quality has always remained one of the top priorities of public authorities.To ensure the quality of water, different methods for monitoring and assessing the water networks, such as offline and online surveys, are used.However, these surveys have several limitations, such as the limited number of participants and low frequency due to the labor involved in conducting such surveys.In this paper, we propose a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automatically collect and analyze water-related posts from social media for data-driven decisions.The proposed framework is composed of two components, namely (i) text classification, and (ii) topic modeling.For text classification, we propose a merit-fusion-based framework incorporating several Large Language Models (LLMs) where different weight selection and optimization methods are employed to assign weights to the LLMs.In topic modeling, we employed the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the water-related tweets.We also analyzed relevant tweets originating from different regions and countries to explore global, regional, and country-specific issues and water-related concerns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also collected and manually annotated a large-scale dataset, which is expected to facilitate future research on the topic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs.They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur.However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks.While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps.This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs).However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel.In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data.Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up.Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text.As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly.We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.931</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent In-IDE AI coding assistant tools (ACATs) like GitHub Copilot have significantly impacted developers' coding habits.While some studies have examined their effectiveness, there lacks in-depth investigation into the actual assistance process.To bridge this gap, we simulate real development scenarios encompassing three typical types of software development tasks and recruit 27 computer science students to investigate their behavior with three popular ACATs.Our goal is to comprehensively assess ACATs' effectiveness, explore characteristics of recommended code, identify reasons for modifications, and understand users' challenges and expectations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate the study, we develop an experimental platform that includes a data collection plugin for VSCode IDE and provides functions for screen recording, code evaluation, and automatic generation of personalized interview and survey questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>Through analysis of the collected data, we find that ACATs generally enhance task completion rates, reduce time, improve code quality, and increase self-perceived productivity.However, the improvement is influenced by both the nature of coding tasks and users' experience level.Notably, for experienced participants, the use of ACATs may even increase completion time.We observe that "edited line completion" is the most frequently recommended way, while "comments completion" and "string completion" have the lowest acceptance rates.The primary reasons for modifying recommended code are disparities between output formats and requirements, flawed logic, and inconsistent code styles.In terms of challenges and expectations, optimization of service access and help documentation is also concerned by participants except for functionality and performance.Our study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness and usability of ACATs, informing further improvements in their design and implementation.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge of tree species distribution is fundamental to managing forests.New deep learning approaches promise significant accuracy gains for forest mapping, and are becoming a critical tool for mapping multiple tree species at scale.To advance the field, deep learning researchers need large benchmark datasets with high-quality annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we present the PureForest dataset: a large-scale, open, multimodal dataset designed for tree species classification from both Aerial Lidar Scanning (ALS) point clouds and Very High Resolution (VHR) aerial images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>Most current public Lidar datasets for tree species classification have low diversity as they only span a small area of a few dozen annotated hectares at most.In contrast, PureForest has 18 tree species grouped into 13 semantic classes, and spans 339 km$^2$ across 449 distinct monospecific forests, and is to date the largest and most comprehensive Lidar dataset for the identification of tree species.By making PureForest publicly available, we hope to provide a challenging benchmark dataset to support the development of deep learning approaches for tree species identification from Lidar and/or aerial imagery.In this data paper, we describe the annotation workflow, the dataset, the recommended evaluation methodology, and establish a baseline performance from both 3D and 2D modalities.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid growth of information technology, users are exposed to a massive amount of data online, including image, music, and video.This has led to strong needs to provide effective corresponsive search services such as image, music, and video search services.Most of them are operated based on keywords, namely using keywords to find related image, music, and video.Additionally, there are image-to-image search services that enable users to find similar images using one input image.Given that videos are essentially composed of image frames, then similar videos can be searched by one input image or screenshot.We want to target this scenario and provide an efficient method and implementation in this paper.   We present Shotit, a cloud-native image-to-video search engine that tailors this search scenario in a compute-efficient approach.One main limitation faced in this scenario is the scale of its dataset.A typical image-to-image search engine only handles one-to-one relationships, colloquially, one image corresponds to another single image.But image-to-video proliferates.Take a 24-min length video as an example, it will generate roughly 20,000 image frames.As the number of videos grows, the scale of the dataset explodes exponentially.In this case, a compute-efficient approach ought to be considered, and the system design should cater to the cloud-native trend.Choosing an emerging technology - vector database as its backbone, Shotit fits these two metrics performantly.Experiments for two different datasets, a 50 thousand-scale Blender Open Movie dataset, and a 50 million-scale proprietary TV genre dataset at a 4 Core 32GB RAM Intel Xeon Gold 6271C cloud machine with object storage reveal the effectiveness of Shotit.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A demo regarding the Blender Open Movie dataset is illustrated within this paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span></p>

                  <p>Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target but usually requires simultaneous access to both source and target data.Moreover, UDA approaches commonly assume that source and target domains share the same labels space.Yet, these two assumptions are hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios.This paper considers the more challenging Source-Free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting, where both assumptions are dropped.We propose a novel approach for SF-OSDA that exploits the granularity of target-private categories by segregating their samples into multiple unknown classes.Starting from an initial clustering-based assignment, our method progressively improves the segregation of target-private samples by refining their pseudo-labels with the guide of an uncertainty-based sample selection module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive loss, named NL-InfoNCELoss, that, integrating negative learning into self-supervised contrastive learning, enhances the model robustness to noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.Notably, additional analyses show that our method is able to learn the underlying semantics of novel classes, opening the possibility to perform novel class discovery.</p>

                  <p>The traditional Transformer model encounters challenges with variable-length input sequences, particularly in Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC), leading to efficiency and scalability concerns.To overcome this, we propose a pyramid-based hierarchical transformer (PyFormer).This innovative approach organizes input data hierarchically into segments, each representing distinct abstraction levels, thereby enhancing processing efficiency for lengthy sequences.At each level, a dedicated transformer module is applied, effectively capturing both local and global context.Spatial and spectral information flow within the hierarchy facilitates communication and abstraction propagation.Integration of outputs from different levels culminates in the final input representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results underscore the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Additionally, the incorporation of disjoint samples augments robustness and reliability, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach in advancing HSIC.

                  <p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models benefit significantly from semantic information, which allows them to treat different types of objects distinctly.Currently, leveraging semantic information to enhance IQA is a crucial research direction.Traditional methods, hindered by a lack of sufficiently annotated data, have employed the CLIP image-text pretraining model as their backbone to gain semantic awareness.However, the generalist nature of these pre-trained Vision-Language (VL) models often renders them suboptimal for IQA-specific tasks.Recent approaches have attempted to address this mismatch using prompt technology, but these solutions have shortcomings.Existing prompt-based VL models overly focus on incremental semantic information from text, neglecting the rich insights available from visual data analysis.This imbalance limits their performance improvements in IQA tasks.This paper introduces an innovative multi-modal prompt-based methodology for IQA.Our approach employs carefully crafted prompts that synergistically mine incremental semantic information from both visual and linguistic data.Specifically, in the visual branch, we introduce a multi-layer prompt structure to enhance the VL model's adaptability.In the text branch, we deploy a dual-prompt scheme that steers the model to recognize and differentiate between scene category and distortion type, thereby refining the model's capacity to assess image quality.Our experimental findings underscore the effectiveness of our method over existing Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) approaches.Notably, it demonstrates competitive performance across various datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) values of 0.961(surpassing 0.946 in CSIQ) and 0.941 (exceeding 0.930 in KADID), illustrating its robustness and accuracy in diverse contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has proven to be an important part of many robotics systems.Surface normals estimated from LiDAR data are commonly used for a variety of tasks in such systems.As most of the today's mechanical LiDAR sensors produce sparse data, estimating normals from a single scan in a robust manner poses difficulties.   In this paper, we address the problem of estimating normals for sparse LiDAR data avoiding the typical issues of smoothing out the normals in high curvature areas.   Mechanical LiDARs rotate a set of rigidly mounted lasers.One firing of such a set of lasers produces an array of points where each point's neighbor is known due to the known firing pattern of the scanner.We use this knowledge to connect these points to their neighbors and label them using the angles of the lines connecting them.When estimating normals at these points, we only consider points with the same label as neighbors.This allows us to avoid estimating normals in high curvature areas.   We evaluate our approach on various data, both self-recorded and publicly available, acquired using various sparse LiDAR sensors.We show that using our method for normal estimation leads to normals that are more robust in areas with high curvature which leads to maps of higher quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our method only incurs a constant factor runtime overhead with respect to a lightweight baseline normal estimation procedure and is therefore suited for operation in computationally demanding environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) commonly utilize an inertial navigation system (INS) and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) for underwater navigation.To that end, their measurements are integrated through a nonlinear filter such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF).The DVL velocity vector estimate depends on retrieving reflections from the seabed, ensuring that at least three out of its four transmitted acoustic beams return successfully.When fewer than three beams are obtained, the DVL cannot provide a velocity update to bind the navigation solution drift.To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural coupled (HNC) approach for seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited DVL measurements.First, we drive an approach to regress two or three missing DVL beams.Then, those beams, together with the measured beams, are incorporated into the EKF.We examined INS/DVL fusion both in loosely and tightly coupled approaches.Our method was trained and evaluated on recorded data from AUV experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea on two different occasions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline loosely and tightly coupled model-based approaches by an average of 96.15%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>It also demonstrates superior performance compared to a model-based beam estimator by an average of 12.41% in terms of velocity accuracy for scenarios involving two or three missing beams.Therefore, we demonstrate that our approach offers seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited beam measurements.</p>

                  <p>Powered hip exoskeletons have shown the ability for locomotion assistance during treadmill walking.However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging.Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information.In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label.We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride.We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands.We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.Codes and data are available at https://github.com/RuoqiZhao116/SFTIK.</p>

                  <p>Industrial datapath designers consider dynamic power consumption to be a key metric.Arithmetic circuits contribute a major component of total chip power consumption and are therefore a common target for power optimization.While arithmetic circuit area and dynamic power consumption are often correlated, there is also a tradeoff to consider, as additional gates can be added to explicitly reduce arithmetic circuit activity and hence reduce power consumption.In this work, we consider two forms of power optimization and their interaction: circuit area reduction via arithmetic optimization, and the elimination of redundant computations using both data and clock gating.By encoding both these classes of optimization as local rewrites of expressions, our tool flow can simultaneously explore them, uncovering new opportunities for power saving through arithmetic rewrites using the e-graph data structure.Since power consumption is highly dependent upon the workload performed by the circuit, our tool flow facilitates a data dependent design paradigm, where an implementation is automatically tailored to particular contexts of data activity.We develop an automated RTL to RTL optimization framework, ROVER, that takes circuit input stimuli and generates power-efficient architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effectiveness on both open-source arithmetic benchmarks and benchmarks derived from Intel production examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>The tool is able to reduce the total power consumption by up to 33.9%.</p>

We find that otherwise highly-capable language models demonstrate surprisingly limited time series reasoning: they score marginally above random on etiological and question answering tasks (up to 30 percentage points worse than humans) and show modest success in using context to improve forecasting.These weakness showcase that time series reasoning is an impactful, yet deeply underdeveloped direction for language model research.We also make our datasets and code public at to support further research in this direction at https://github.com/behavioral-data/TSandLanguage</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data.It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications.While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required.Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology.To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems.By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span></p>

                  <p>A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA).In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems.The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy.This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills.With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty.Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems.Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.</p>

In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself.In other words, these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens.We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Project page: https://locuslab.github.io/acr-memorization.</p>

                  <p>Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing deep learning-based models for automated code completion.Although using source code in GitHub has been a common practice for training deep-learning-based models for code completion, it may induce some legal and ethical issues such as copyright infringement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we investigate the legal and ethical issues of current neural code completion models by answering the following question: Is my code used to train your neural code completion model? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>To this end, we tailor a membership inference approach (termed CodeMI) that was originally crafted for classification tasks to a more challenging task of code completion.In particular, since the target code completion models perform as opaque black boxes, preventing access to their training data and parameters, we opt to train multiple shadow models to mimic their behavior.The acquired posteriors from these shadow models are subsequently employed to train a membership classifier.Subsequently, the membership classifier can be effectively employed to deduce the membership status of a given code sample based on the output of a target code completion model.We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of this adapted approach across a diverse array of neural code completion models, (i.e., LSTM-based, CodeGPT, CodeGen, and StarCoder).Experimental results reveal that the LSTM-based and CodeGPT models suffer the membership leakage issue, which can be easily detected by our proposed membership inference approach with an accuracy of 0.842, and 0.730, respectively.Interestingly, our experiments also show that the data membership of current large language models of code, e.g., CodeGen and StarCoder, is difficult to detect, leaving amper space for further improvement.Finally, we also try to explain the findings from the perspective of model memorization.</p>

                  <p>Language models (LMs) trained on vast quantities of text data can acquire sophisticated skills such as generating summaries, answering questions or generating code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they also manifest behaviors that violate human preferences, e.g., they can generate offensive content, falsehoods or perpetuate social biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>In this thesis, I explore several approaches to aligning LMs with human preferences.First, I argue that aligning LMs can be seen as Bayesian inference: conditioning a prior (base, pretrained LM) on evidence about human preferences (Chapter 2).Conditioning on human preferences can be implemented in numerous ways.In Chapter 3, I investigate the relation between two approaches to finetuning pretrained LMs using feedback given by a scoring function: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and distribution matching.I show that RLHF can be seen as a special case of distribution matching but distributional matching is strictly more general.In chapter 4, I show how to extend the distribution matching to conditional language models.Finally, in chapter 5 I explore a different root: conditioning an LM on human preferences already during pretraining.I show that involving human feedback from the very start tends to be more effective than using it only during supervised finetuning.Overall, these results highlight the room for alignment techniques different from and complementary to RLHF.</p>

                  <p>Deep models trained on large amounts of data often incorporate implicit biases present during training time.If later such a bias is discovered during inference or deployment, it is often necessary to acquire new data and retrain the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This behavior is especially problematic in critical areas such as autonomous driving or medical decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>In these scenarios, new data is often expensive and hard to come by.In this work, we present a method based on change penalization that takes a pre-trained model and adapts the weights to mitigate a previously detected bias.We achieve this by tuning a zero-initialized copy of a frozen pre-trained network.Our method needs very few, in extreme cases only a single, examples that contradict the bias to increase performance.Additionally, we propose an early stopping criterion to modify baselines and reduce overfitting.We evaluate our approach on a well-known bias in skin lesion classification and three other datasets from the domain shift literature.We find that our approach works especially well with very few images.Simple fine-tuning combined with our early stopping also leads to performance benefits for a larger number of tuning samples.</p>
