                  <p>Language model alignment is a cutting-edge technique in large language model training to align the model output to user's intent, e.g., being helpful and harmless.Recent alignment framework consists of two steps: supervised fine-tuning with demonstration data and preference learning with human preference data.Previous preference learning methods, such as RLHF and DPO, mainly focus on pair-wise preference data.However, in many real-world scenarios where human feedbacks are intrinsically point-wise, these methods will suffer from information loss or even fail.To fill this gap, in this paper, we first develop a preference learning method called point-wise DPO to tackle point-wise preference data.Further revelation on the connection between supervised fine-tuning and point-wise preference learning enables us to develop a unified framework for both human demonstration and point-wise preference data, which sheds new light on the construction of preference dataset.Extensive experiments on point-wise datasets with binary or continuous labels demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our proposed methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A new dataset with high-quality demonstration samples on harmlessness is constructed and made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span></p>

                  <p>Humanoid control is an important research challenge offering avenues for integration into human-centric infrastructures and enabling physics-driven humanoid animations.The daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC).For 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviours.Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviors to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning.Notably, H-GAP excels established MPC baselines that have access to the ground truth dynamics model, and is superior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks.Finally, we do a series of empirical studies on the scaling properties of H-GAP, showing the potential for performance gains via additional data but not computing.Code and videos are available at https://ycxuyingchen.github.io/hgap/.</p>

                  <p>Due to the advent and increase in the popularity of the Internet, people have been producing and disseminating textual data in several ways, such as reviews, social media posts, and news articles.As a result, numerous researchers have been working on discovering patterns in textual data, especially because social media posts function as social sensors, indicating peoples' opinions, interests, etc.However, most tasks regarding natural language processing are addressed using traditional machine learning methods and static datasets.This setting can lead to several problems, such as an outdated dataset, which may not correspond to reality, and an outdated model, which has its performance degrading over time.Concept drift is another aspect that emphasizes these issues, which corresponds to data distribution and pattern changes.In a text stream scenario, it is even more challenging due to its characteristics, such as the high speed and data arriving sequentially.In addition, models for this type of scenario must adhere to the constraints mentioned above while learning from the stream by storing texts for a limited time and consuming low memory.In this study, we performed a systematic literature review regarding concept drift adaptation in text stream scenarios.Considering well-defined criteria, we selected 40 papers to unravel aspects such as text drift categories, types of text drift detection, model update mechanism, the addressed stream mining tasks, types of text representations, and text representation update mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we discussed drift visualization and simulation and listed real-world datasets used in the selected papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews the concept drift adaptation in text stream mining scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Researchers have proposed to use data of human preference feedback to fine-tune text-to-image generative models.However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation.Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically annotate user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images.We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images.Specifically, AU4 (brow lowerer) is most consistently reflective of negative evaluations of the generated image.This can be useful in two ways.Firstly, we can automatically annotate user preferences between image pairs with substantial difference in AU4 responses to them with an accuracy significantly outperforming state-of-the-art scoring models.Secondly, directly integrating the AU4 responses with the scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences.Additionally, the AU4 response best reflects the user's evaluation of the image fidelity, making it complementary to the state-of-the-art scoring models, which are generally better at reflecting image-text alignment.Finally, this method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code is available at https://github.com/ShuangquanFeng/FERGI, and the dataset is also available at the same link for research purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>The unstructured nature of clinical notes within electronic health records often conceals vital patient-related information, making it challenging to access or interpret.To uncover this hidden information, specialized Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are required.However, training these models necessitates large amounts of labeled data, a process that is both time-consuming and costly when relying solely on human experts for annotation.In this paper, we propose an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with human expertise to create an efficient method for generating ground truth labels for medical text annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By utilizing LLMs in conjunction with human annotators, we significantly reduce the human annotation burden, enabling the rapid creation of labeled datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>We rigorously evaluate our method on a medical information extraction task, demonstrating that our approach not only substantially cuts down on human intervention but also maintains high accuracy.The results highlight the potential of using LLMs to improve the utilization of unstructured clinical data, allowing for the swift deployment of tailored NLP solutions in healthcare.</p>

                  <p>We propose the task of Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) which extends the recently popular Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task with instance-level information to produce a richer understanding of the 3D scene.Our PSC proposal utilizes a hybrid mask-based technique on the non-empty voxels from sparse multi-scale completions.Whereas the SSC literature overlooks uncertainty which is critical for robotics applications, we instead propose an efficient ensembling to estimate both voxel-wise and instance-wise uncertainties along PSC.This is achieved by building on a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy, while improving performance and yielding better uncertainty for little additional compute.Additionally, we introduce a technique to aggregate permutation-invariant mask predictions.Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all baselines in both Panoptic Scene Completion and uncertainty estimation on three large-scale autonomous driving datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at https://astra-vision.github.io/PaSCo . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper proposes an assistive system for architects that converts a large-scale point cloud into a standardized digital representation of a building for Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications.The process is known as Scan-to-BIM, which requires many hours of manual work even for a single building floor by a professional architect.Given its challenging nature, the paper focuses on helping architects on the Scan-to-BIM process, instead of replacing them.Concretely, we propose an assistive Scan-to-BIM system that takes the raw sensor data and edit history (including the current BIM model), then auto-regressively predicts a sequence of model editing operations as APIs of a professional BIM software (i.e., Autodesk Revit).The paper also presents the first building-scale Scan2BIM dataset that contains a sequence of model editing operations as the APIs of Autodesk Revit.The dataset contains 89 hours of Scan2BIM modeling processes by professional architects over 16 scenes, spanning over 35,000 m^2.We report our system's reconstruction quality with standard metrics, and we introduce a novel metric that measures how natural the order of reconstructed operations is.A simple modification to the reconstruction module helps improve performance, and our method is far superior to two other baselines in the order metric.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release data, code, and models at a-scan2bim.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance.Many prior works have aimed to align with diverse aspects of the original datasets, such as matching the training weight trajectories, gradient, feature/BatchNorm distributions, etc.In this work, we show how to distill various large-scale datasets such as full ImageNet-1K/21K under a conventional input resolution of 224$\times$224 to achieve the best accuracy over all previous approaches, including SRe$^2$L, TESLA and MTT.To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective ${\bf C}$urriculum ${\bf D}$ata ${\bf A}$ugmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis that obtains the accuracy on large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2% under IPC (Images Per Class) 50 and 36.1% under IPC 20, respectively.Finally, we show that, by integrating all our enhancements together, the proposed model beats the current state-of-the-art by more than 4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K/21K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterpart to less than absolute 15%.Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on larger-scale ImageNet-21K under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and distilled ImageNet-21K dataset of 20 IPC, 2K recovery budget are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/SRe2L/tree/main/CDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, short videos (SVs) are essential to information acquisition and sharing in our life.The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of emotion recognition in SVs.Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling.Some commonly used videos (e.g., facial expressions and postures) have been well studied.However, it is still challenging to understand the emotions in SVs.Since the enhanced content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists information gaps caused by the emotion incompleteness under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions.To tackle these problems, we present an end-to-end baseline method AV-CPNet that employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations.We further design the two-stage cross-modal fusion module to complementarily model the correlations of audio-visual features.The EP-CE Loss, incorporating three emotion polarities, is then applied to guide model optimization.Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the effectiveness of AV-CPNet.Datasets and code will be open on https://github.com/XuecWu/eMotions.</p>

                  <p>Contrastive learning has proven to be an effective method for pre-training models using weakly labeled data in the vision domain.Sentence transformers are the NLP counterparts to this architecture, and have been growing in popularity due to their rich and effective sentence representations.Having effective sentence representations is paramount in multiple tasks, such as information retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and sentence comparison.Keeping in mind the deployability factor of transformers, evaluating the robustness of sentence transformers is of utmost importance.This work focuses on evaluating the robustness of the sentence encoders.We employ several adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness.This system uses character-level attacks in the form of random character substitution, word-level attacks in the form of synonym replacement, and sentence-level attacks in the form of intra-sentence word order shuffling.The results of the experiments strongly undermine the robustness of sentence encoders.The models produce significantly different predictions as well as embeddings on perturbed datasets.The accuracy of the models can fall up to 15 percent on perturbed datasets as compared to unperturbed datasets.Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that these embeddings does capture the semantic and syntactic structure (sentence order) of sentences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing supervised classification strategies fail to leverage this information, and merely function as n-gram detectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) emerges as an effective collaborative learning framework to coordinate data and computation resources from massive and distributed clients in training.Such collaboration results in non-trivial intellectual property (IP) represented by the model parameters that should be protected and shared by the whole party rather than an individual user.Meanwhile, the distributed nature of FL endorses a malicious client the convenience to compromise IP through illegal model leakage to unauthorized third parties.To block such IP leakage, it is essential to make the IP identifiable in the shared model and locate the anonymous infringer who first leaks it.The collective challenges call for \emph{accountable federated learning}, which requires verifiable ownership of the model and is capable of revealing the infringer's identity upon leakage.In this paper, we propose Decodable Unique Watermarking (DUW) for complying with the requirements of accountable FL.Specifically, before a global model is sent to a client in an FL round, DUW encodes a client-unique key into the model by leveraging a backdoor-based watermark injection.To identify the infringer of a leaked model, DUW examines the model and checks if the triggers can be decoded as the corresponding keys.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical results show that DUW is highly effective and robust, achieving over $99\%$ watermark success rate for Digits, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets under heterogeneous FL settings, and identifying the IP infringer with $100\%$ accuracy even after common watermark removal attempts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, the growing memory demands of embedding tables in Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) pose great challenges for model training and deployment.Existing embedding compression solutions cannot simultaneously meet three key design requirements: memory efficiency, low latency, and adaptability to dynamic data distribution.This paper presents CAFE, a Compact, Adaptive, and Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements.The design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources to important features (called hot features), and allocate less memory to unimportant ones.In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data structure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot features in real time.For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique embedding.For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one embedding by using hash embedding technique.Guided by our design philosophy, we further propose a multi-level hash embedding framework to optimize the embedding tables of non-hot features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We theoretically analyze the accuracy of HotSketch, and analyze the model convergence against deviation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>Extensive experiments show that CAFE significantly outperforms existing embedding compression methods, yielding 3.92% and 3.68% superior testing AUC on Criteo Kaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10000x.The source codes of CAFE are available at GitHub.</p>

                  <p>Training and deploying machine learning models that meet fairness criteria for protected groups are fundamental in modern artificial intelligence.While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these methods are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers.Here, the term "stochastic" refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data.Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f-divergence measures (f-FERM).The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f-FERM for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data.Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f-FERM objective under $L_p$ norms as uncertainty sets.Again, in this distributionally robust setting, f-FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts.An efficient stochastic implementation of $f$-FERM is publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Adversarial training integrates adversarial examples during model training to enhance robustness.However, its application in fixed dataset settings differs from real-world dynamics, where data accumulates incrementally.In this study, we investigate Adversarially Robust Class Incremental Learning (ARCIL), a method that combines adversarial robustness with incremental learning.We observe that combining incremental learning with naive adversarial training easily leads to a loss of robustness.We discover that this is attributed to the disappearance of the flatness of the loss function, a characteristic of adversarial training.To address this issue, we propose the Flatness Preserving Distillation (FPD) loss that leverages the output difference between adversarial and clean examples.Additionally, we introduce the Logit Adjustment Distillation (LAD) loss, which adapts the model's knowledge to perform well on new tasks.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over approaches that apply adversarial training to existing incremental learning methods, which provides a strong baseline for incremental learning on adversarial robustness in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves AutoAttack accuracy that is 5.99\%p, 5.27\%p, and 3.90\%p higher on average than the baseline on split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>The code will be made available.</p>

                  <p>In evolving cyber landscapes, the detection of malicious URLs calls for cooperation and knowledge sharing across domains.However, collaboration is often hindered by concerns over privacy and business sensitivities.Federated learning addresses these issues by enabling multi-clients collaboration without direct data exchange.Unfortunately, if highly expressive Transformer models are used, clients may face intolerable computational burdens, and the exchange of weights could quickly deplete network bandwidth.In this paper, we propose Fed-urlBERT, a federated URL pre-trained model designed to address both privacy concerns and the need for cross-domain collaboration in cybersecurity.Fed-urlBERT leverages split learning to divide the pre-training model into client and server part, so that the client part takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth.Our appraoch achieves performance comparable to centralized model under both independently and identically distributed (IID) and two non-IID data scenarios.Significantly, our federated model shows about an 7% decrease in the FPR compared to the centralized model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we implement an adaptive local aggregation strategy that mitigates heterogeneity among clients, demonstrating promising performance improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Overall, our study validates the applicability of the proposed Transformer federated learning for URL threat analysis, establishing a foundation for real-world collaborative cybersecurity efforts.The source code is accessible at https://github.com/Davidup1/FedURLBERT.</p>

                  <p>Humanoid control is an important research challenge offering avenues for integration into human-centric infrastructures and enabling physics-driven humanoid animations.The daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids.However, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges.In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC).For 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviours.Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviors to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning.Notably, H-GAP excels established MPC baselines that have access to the ground truth dynamics model, and is superior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we do a series of empirical studies on the scaling properties of H-GAP, showing the potential for performance gains via additional data but not computing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Code and videos are available at https://ycxuyingchen.github.io/hgap/.</p>

                  <p>Sign Languages (SL) serve as the predominant mode of communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities.The advent of deep learning has aided numerous methods in SL recognition and translation, achieving remarkable results.However, Sign Language Production (SLP) poses a challenge for the computer vision community as the motions generated must be realistic and have precise semantic meanings.Most SLP methods rely on 2D data, thus impeding their ability to attain a necessary level of realism.In this work, we propose a diffusion-based SLP model trained on a curated large-scale dataset of 4D signing avatars and their corresponding text transcripts.The proposed method can generate dynamic sequences of 3D avatars from an unconstrained domain of discourse using a diffusion process formed on a novel and anatomically informed graph neural network defined on the SMPL-X body skeleton.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that the proposed method considerably outperforms previous methods of SLP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We believe that this work presents an important and necessary step towards realistic neural sign avatars, bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities.The code, method and generated data will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a key retrieval technique for vector database and many data center applications, such as person re-identification and recommendation systems.Among all the ANNS algorithms, graph-traversal-based ANNS achieves the highest recall rate.However, as the size of dataset increases, the graph may require hundreds of gigabytes of memory, exceeding the main memory capacity of a single workstation node.Although we can do partitioning and use solid-state drive (SSD) as the backing storage, the limited SSD I/O bandwidth severely degrades the performance of the system.To address this challenge, we present NDSearch, a near-data processing (NDP) solution for ANNS processing.NDSearch consists of a novel in-storage computing architecture, namely, SEARSSD, that supports the ANNS kernels and leverages logic unit (LUN)-level parallelism inside the NAND flash chips.NDSearch also includes a processing model that is customized for NDP and cooperates with SEARSSD.The processing model enables us to apply a two-level scheduling to improve the data locality and exploit the internal bandwidth in NDSEARCH, and a speculative searching mechanism to further accelerate the ANNS workload.Our results show that NDSearch improves the throughput by up to 31.7x, 14.6x, 7.4x, 2.9x over CPU, GPU, a state-of-the-art SmartSSD-only design, and DeepStore, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>NDSEARCH also achieves two orders-of-magnitude higher energy efficiency than CPU and GPU. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Collaborative filtering is a popular approach in recommender systems, whose objective is to provide personalized item suggestions to potential users based on their purchase or browsing history.However, personalized recommendations require considerable amount of behavioral data on users, which is usually unavailable for new users, giving rise to the cold-start problem.To help alleviate this challenging problem, we introduce a spectral graph wavelet collaborative filtering framework for implicit feedback data, where users, items and their interactions are represented as a bipartite graph.Specifically, we first propose an adaptive transfer function by leveraging a power transform with the goal of stabilizing the variance of graph frequencies in the spectral domain.Then, we design a deep recommendation model for efficient learning of low-dimensional embeddings of users and items using spectral graph wavelets in an end-to-end fashion.In addition to capturing the graph's local and global structures, our approach yields localization of graph signals in both spatial and spectral domains, and hence not only learns discriminative representations of users and items, but also promotes the recommendation quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, achieving better recommendation performance compared with strong baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>The worldwide collaborative effort for the creation of software is technically and socially demanding.The more engaged developers are, the more value they impart to the software they create.Engaged developers, such as Margaret Hamilton programming Apollo 11, can succeed in tackling the most difficult engineering tasks.In this paper, we dive deep into an original vector of engagement - humor - and study how it fuels developer engagement.First, we collect qualitative and quantitative data about the humorous elements present within three significant, real-world software projects: faker, which helps developers introduce humor within their tests; lolcommits, which captures a photograph after each contribution made by a developer; and volkswagen, an exercise in satire, which accidentally led to the invention of an impactful software tool.Second, through a developer survey, we receive unique insights from 125 developers, who share their real-life experiences with humor in software.Our analysis of the three case studies highlights the prevalence of humor in software, and unveils the worldwide community of developers who are enthusiastic about both software and humor.We also learn about the caveats of humor in software through the valuable insights shared by our survey respondents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We report clear evidence that, when practiced responsibly, humor increases developer engagement and supports them in addressing hard engineering and cognitive tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>The most actionable highlight of our work is that software tests and documentation are the best locations in code to practice humor.</p>

                Decoding Logic Errors: A Comparative Study on Bug Detection by Students and Large Language Models

                  <p>The emergence of open-source ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Auto ML has enabled developers to harness state-of-the-art ML algorithms with minimal overhead.However, during this accelerated ML development process, said developers may often make sub-optimal design and implementation decisions, leading to the introduction of technical debt that, if not addressed promptly, can have a significant impact on the quality of the ML-based software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers frequently acknowledge these sub-optimal design and development choices through code comments during software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>These comments, which often highlight areas requiring additional work or refinement in the future, are known as self-admitted technical debt (SATD).This paper aims to investigate SATD in ML code by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains, along with 318 non-ML projects.We detected SATD in source code comments throughout the different project snapshots, conducted a manual analysis of the identified SATD sample to comprehend the nature of technical debt in the ML code, and performed a survival analysis of the SATD to understand the evolution of such debts.We observed: i) Machine learning projects have a median percentage of SATD that is twice the median percentage of SATD in non-machine learning projects.ii) ML pipeline components for data preprocessing and model generation logic are more susceptible to debt than model validation and deployment components.iii) SATDs appear in ML projects earlier in the development process compared to non-ML projects.iv) Long-lasting SATDs are typically introduced during extensive code changes that span multiple files exhibiting low complexity.</p>
