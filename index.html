                  <p>In recent years, the attention towards One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has been driven by its capacity to minimize communication.With the development of the diffusion model (DM), several methods employ the DM for OSFL, utilizing model parameters, image features, or textual prompts as mediums to transfer the local client knowledge to the server.However, these mediums often require public datasets or the uniform feature extractor, significantly limiting their practicality.In this paper, we propose FedDEO, a Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning Method with DMs, offering a novel exploration of utilizing the DM in OSFL.The core idea of our method involves training local descriptions on the clients, serving as the medium to transfer the knowledge of the distributed clients to the server.Firstly, we train local descriptions on the client data to capture the characteristics of client distributions, which are then uploaded to the server.On the server, the descriptions are used as conditions to guide the DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the distributions of various clients, enabling the training of the aggregated model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Theoretical analyses and sufficient quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that through the training of local descriptions, the server is capable of generating synthetic datasets with high quality and diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>Consequently, with advantages in communication and privacy protection, the aggregated model outperforms compared FL or diffusion-based OSFL methods and, on some clients, outperforms the performance ceiling of centralized training.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for closed-form computation and visualization of critical point uncertainty in 2D uncertain scalar fields.Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields.The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions.Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks.In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions.Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software.We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution.First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods.Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support.Second, we accelerate critical point probability computations using a parallel implementation with the VTK-m library, which is platform portable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate the integration of our implementation with the ParaView software system to demonstrate near-real-time results for real datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span></p>

                  <p>Small Video Object Detection (SVOD) is a crucial subfield in modern computer vision, essential for early object discovery and detection.However, existing SVOD datasets are scarce and suffer from issues such as insufficiently small objects, limited object categories, and lack of scene diversity, leading to unitary application scenarios for corresponding methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we develop the XS-VID dataset, which comprises aerial data from various periods and scenes, and annotates eight major object categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>To further evaluate existing methods for detecting extremely small objects, XS-VID extensively collects three types of objects with smaller pixel areas: extremely small (\textit{es}, $0\sim12^2$), relatively small (\textit{rs}, $12^2\sim20^2$), and generally small (\textit{gs}, $20^2\sim32^2$).XS-VID offers unprecedented breadth and depth in covering and quantifying minuscule objects, significantly enriching the scene and object diversity in the dataset.Extensive validations on XS-VID and the publicly available VisDrone2019VID dataset show that existing methods struggle with small object detection and significantly underperform compared to general object detectors.Leveraging the strengths of previous methods and addressing their weaknesses, we propose YOLOFT, which enhances local feature associations and integrates temporal motion features, significantly improving the accuracy and stability of SVOD.Our datasets and benchmarks are available at \url{https://gjhhust.github.io/XS-VID/}.</p>

                  <p>Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies.While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question.The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity.We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction).AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods.AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods.Based on this new dataset, we benchmarked various representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances are not satisfactory as expected for epitope prediction.We thus propose a new method, WALLE, that leverages both protein language models and graph neural networks.WALLE demonstrate about 5X performance gain over existing methods.Our empirical findings evidence that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential embeddings provided by language models and geometrical information from graph representations, providing a guideline for future method design.In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing easy model performance attribution and interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span></p>

                  <p>Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases.The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost has led to an exponential increase in patient-level GV data.This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management.To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged.However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations.This poses the question: How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs?We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges.We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named GV-Rep, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts.Our contributions are three-fold: (i) Construction of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically verified GVs from real-world patients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(ii) Analysis of the structure and properties of the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>(iii) Experimentation of the dataset with pre-trained GFMs.The results show a significant gap between GFMs current capabilities and accurate GV representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope this dataset will help advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Financial risks trend to spread from one entity to another, ultimately leading to systemic risks.The key to preventing such risks lies in understanding the causal chains behind risk contagion.Despite this, prevailing approaches primarily emphasize identifying risks, overlooking the underlying causal analysis of risk.To address such an issue, we propose a Risk Contagion Causal Reasoning model called RC2R, which uses the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to dissect the causal mechanisms of risk contagion grounded in the factual and expert knowledge embedded within financial knowledge graphs (KGs).At the data level, we utilize financial KGs to construct causal instructions, empowering LLMs to perform formal causal reasoning on risk propagation and tackle the "causal parrot" problem of LLMs.In terms of model architecture, we integrate a fusion module that aligns tokens and nodes across various granularities via multi-scale contrastive learning, followed by the amalgamation of textual and graph-structured data through soft prompt with cross multi-head attention mechanisms.To quantify risk contagion, we introduce a risk pathway inference module for calculating risk scores for each node in the graph.Finally, we visualize the risk contagion pathways and their intensities using Sankey diagrams, providing detailed causal explanations.Comprehensive experiments on financial KGs and supply chain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make our dataset and code publicly accessible to encourage further research and development in this field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

                  <p>Estimating abnormal posture based on 3D pose is vital in human pose analysis, yet it presents challenges, especially when reconstructing 3D human poses from monocular datasets with occlusions.Accurate reconstructions enable the restoration of 3D movements, which assist in the extraction of semantic details necessary for analyzing abnormal behaviors.However, most existing methods depend on predefined key points as a basis for estimating the coordinates of occluded joints, where variations in data quality have adversely affected the performance of these models.In this paper, we present OAD2D, which discriminates against motion abnormalities based on reconstructing 3D coordinates of mesh vertices and human joints from monocular videos.The OAD2D employs optical flow to capture motion prior information in video streams, enriching the information on occluded human movements and ensuring temporal-spatial alignment of poses.Moreover, we reformulate the abnormal posture estimation by coupling it with Motion to Text (M2T) model in which, the VQVAE is employed to quantize motion features.This approach maps motion tokens to text tokens, allowing for a semantically interpretable analysis of motion, and enhancing the generalization of abnormal posture detection boosted by Language model.Our approach demonstrates the robustness of abnormal behavior detection against severe and self-occlusions, as it reconstructs human motion trajectories in global coordinates to effectively mitigate occlusion issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, validated using the Human3.6M, 3DPW, and NTU RGB+D datasets, achieves a high $F_1-$Score of 0.94 on the NTU RGB+D dataset for medical condition detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>And we will release all of our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable advancements in various fields using large, well-annotated datasets.However, real-world data often exhibit long-tailed distributions and label noise, significantly degrading generalization performance.Recent studies addressing these issues have focused on noisy sample selection methods that estimate the centroid of each class based on high-confidence samples within each target class.The performance of these methods is limited because they use only the training samples within each class for class centroid estimation, making the quality of centroids susceptible to long-tailed distributions and noisy labels.In this study, we present a robust training framework called Distribution-aware Sample Selection and Contrastive Learning (DaSC).Specifically, DaSC introduces a Distribution-aware Class Centroid Estimation (DaCC) to generate enhanced class centroids.DaCC performs weighted averaging of the features from all samples, with weights determined based on model predictions.Additionally, we propose a confidence-aware contrastive learning strategy to obtain balanced and robust representations.The training samples are categorized into high-confidence and low-confidence samples.Our method then applies Semi-supervised Balanced Contrastive Loss (SBCL) using high-confidence samples, leveraging reliable label information to mitigate class bias.For the low-confidence samples, our method computes Mixup-enhanced Instance Discrimination Loss (MIDL) to improve their representations in a self-supervised manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results on CIFAR and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DaSC compared to previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in the field of recommender systems.Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals.Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques.Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges: i) Data augmentation (e.g., discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality.ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals.However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance.   To overcome these challenges, we propose a High-Order Fusion Graph Contrastive Learning (HFGCL) framework for recommendation.Specifically, we discards the data augmentations and instead high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views.Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective.By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel approach to Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by leveraging the concept of contextuality to enhance the identification and classification of categories in unlabeled datasets.Drawing inspiration from human cognition's ability to recognize objects within their context, we propose a dual-context based method.   Our model integrates two levels of contextuality: instance-level, where nearest-neighbor contexts are utilized for contrastive learning, and cluster-level, employing prototypical contrastive learning based on category prototypes.The integration of the contextual information effectively improves the feature learning and thereby the classification accuracy of all categories, which better deals with the real-world datasets.Different from the traditional semi-supervised and novel category discovery techniques, our model focuses on a more realistic and challenging scenario where both known and novel categories are present in the unlabeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/Clarence-CV/Contexuality-GCD</p>

                  <p>Modern financial institutions rely on data for many operations, including a need to drive efficiency, enhance services and prevent financial crime.Data sharing across an organisation or between institutions can facilitate rapid, evidence-based decision making, including identifying money laundering and fraud.However, data privacy regulations impose restrictions on data sharing.Privacy-enhancing technologies are being increasingly employed to allow organisations to derive shared intelligence while ensuring regulatory compliance.This paper examines the case in which regulatory restrictions mean a party cannot share data on accounts of interest with another (internal or external) party to identify people that hold an account in each dataset.We observe that the names of account holders may be recorded differently in each data set.We introduce a novel privacy-preserving approach for fuzzy name matching across institutions, employing fully homomorphic encryption with locality-sensitive hashing.The efficiency of the approach is enhanced using a clustering mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach are evaluated using different datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate it takes around 100 and 1000 seconds to search 1000 names from 10k and 100k names, respectively.Moreover, the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reducing communication overhead by 30-300 times, using clustering.</p>

                  <p>The Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) is one of the most fundamental tools in differential privacy (DP).It works as a backbone for adaptive data analysis by answering a sequence of queries on a given dataset, and gleaning useful information in a privacy-preserving manner.Unlike the typical private query releases that directly publicize the noisy query results, SVT is less informative -- it keeps the noisy query results to itself and only reveals a binary bit for each query, indicating whether the query result surpasses a predefined threshold.To provide a rigorous DP guarantee for SVT, prior works in the literature adopt a conservative privacy analysis by assuming the direct disclosure of noisy query results as in typical private query releases.This approach, however, hinders SVT from achieving higher query accuracy due to an overestimation of the privacy risks, which further leads to an excessive noise injection using the Laplacian or Gaussian noise for perturbation.Motivated by this, we provide a new privacy analysis for SVT by considering its less informative nature.Our analysis results not only broaden the range of applicable noise types for perturbation in SVT, but also identify the exponential noise as optimal among all evaluated noises (which, however, is usually deemed non-applicable in prior works).The main challenge in applying exponential noise to SVT is mitigating the sub-optimal performance due to the bias introduced by noise distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we develop a utility-oriented optimal threshold correction method and an appending strategy, which enhances the performance of SVT by increasing the precision and recall, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our proposed methods is substantiated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating significant improvements up to $50\%$ across evaluated metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Novel Class Discovery (NCD) involves identifying new categories within unlabeled data by utilizing knowledge acquired from previously established categories.However, existing NCD methods often struggle to maintain a balance between the performance of old and new categories.Discovering unlabeled new categories in a class-incremental way is more practical but also more challenging, as it is frequently hindered by either catastrophic forgetting of old categories or an inability to learn new ones.Furthermore, the implementation of NCD on continuously scalable graph-structured data remains an under-explored area.In response to these challenges, we introduce for the first time a more practical NCD scenario for node classification (i.e., NC-NCD), and propose a novel self-training framework with prototype replay and distillation called SWORD, adopted to our NC-NCD setting.Our approach enables the model to cluster unlabeled new category nodes after learning labeled nodes while preserving performance on old categories without reliance on old category nodes.SWORD achieves this by employing a self-training strategy to learn new categories and preventing the forgetting of old categories through the joint use of feature prototypes and knowledge distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four common benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SWORD over other state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>The latest breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), eg., ChatDev, have catalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent collaboration for software development.LLM agents can collaborate in teams like humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on requirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to perform autonomous software generation.However, for an agent team, each phase in a single development process yields only one possible outcome.This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space.Consequently, this may lead to obtaining suboptimal results.To address this challenge, we introduce Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our framework across various domains.We anticipate that our work will guide LLM agents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth in but not limited to software development.The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.</p>

                  <p>In this thesis, we propose an approach to identity resolution across social media platforms using the topics, sentiments, and timings of the posts on the platforms.After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from Disqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the two platforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal approach generally performs better.We found that the temporal window size influences results more than the shifting amount.On the other hand, our sentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little difference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods.We also experimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model, which achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of 2525 in our collected corpus.Future work includes refining sentiment analysis by evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional phases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified rewards.</p>

                  <p>Self-tracking, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of personal data, signifies an individualized way of health governance as people are demanded to build a responsible self by internalizing norms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the technological promises often bear conflicts with various social factors such as a strenuous schedule, a lack of motivation, stress, and anxieties, which fail to deliver health outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span>To re-problematize the phenomenon, this paper situates self-tracking in an overworking culture in China and draws on semi structured and in depth interviews with overworking individuals to reveal the patterns in users interactions and interpretations with self-tracking data.It builds on the current literature of self-tracking and engages with theories from Science and Technology Studies, especially sociomaterial assemblages (Lupton 2016) and technological mediation (Verbeek 2005), to study self-tracking in a contextualized way which connects the micro (data reading, visualization, and affective elements in design) with the macro (work and workplaces, socioeconomic and political background) contexts of self-tracking.Drawing on investigation of the social context that users of self-tracking technologies internalize, reflect, or resist, the paper argues that the productivity and value oriented assumptions and workplace culture shape the imaginary of intensive (and sometimes impossible) self-care and health, an involution of competence embedded in the technological design and users affective experiences.Users respond by enacting different design elements and social contexts to frame two distinctive data practices of self-tracking.</p>

We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families.These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size.We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set.The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering.   We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets.It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes.Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets.For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges.We show an example of how the output of RTRExtractor correlates with meaningful sets of similar vertices in a citation network, demonstrating the utility of RTRExtractor for unsupervised graph discovery tasks.</p>

                  <p>Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit "hallucinations," samples that could never occur in the training data.But where do such hallucinations come from?In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation.Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly "interpolate" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations.Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed.Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate.This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process.Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples.We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset.We release our code at https://github.com/locuslab/diffusion-model-hallucination.</p>

                  <p>Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is to identify a wireless device from its uniqueness of the analog circuitry or hardware imperfections.However, unlike the MAC address which can be modified, such hardware feature is inevitable for the signal emitted to air, which can possibly reveal device whereabouts, e.g., a sniffer can use a pre-trained model to identify a nearby device when receiving its signal.Such fingerprint may expose critical private information, e.g., the associated upper-layer applications or the end-user.In this paper, we propose to erase such RF feature for wireless devices, which can prevent fingerprinting by actively perturbation from the signal perspective.Specifically, we consider a common RF fingerprinting scenario, where machine learning models are trained from pilot signal data for identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel adversarial attack solution is designed to generate proper perturbations, whereby the perturbed pilot signal can hide the hardware feature and misclassify the model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>We theoretically show that the perturbation would not affect the communication function within a tolerable perturbation threshold.We also implement the pilot signal fingerprinting and the proposed perturbation process in a practical LTE system.Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the RF fingerprints can be effectively erased to protect the user privacy.</p>

                  <p>Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, frequently presents with early-stage speech impairments.Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data.Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy and ethical concerns.This review covers the latest DL-based AI approaches for speech-based PD classification, focusing on performance, available resources and associated challenges of 33 scientific works published between 2020 and March 2024.These DL approaches are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL) and deep acoustic features (DAF) extraction.Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular.E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers.TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages.DAF extraction aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods.However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This review also discusses unresolved issues related to bias, explainability and privacy, highlighting the need for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>
