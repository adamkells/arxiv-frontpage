                  <p>Sunlight and shadow play critical roles in how urban spaces are utilized, thrive, and grow.While access to sunlight is essential to the success of urban environments, shadows can provide shaded places to stay during the hot seasons, mitigate heat island effect, and increase pedestrian comfort levels.Properly quantifying sunlight access and shadows in large urban environments is key in tackling some of the important challenges facing cities today.In this paper, we propose Deep Umbra, a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale.Our framework is based on a conditional generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated sunlight access for the different seasons of the year.We use data from seven different cities to train our model, and show, through an extensive set of experiments, its low overall RMSE (below 0.1) as well as its extensibility to cities that were not part of the training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we contribute a set of case studies and a comprehensive dataset with sunlight access information for more than 100 cities across six continents of the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Deep Umbra is available at https://urbantk.org/shadows.</p>

                  <p>Pretraining has been shown to improve performance in many domains, including semantic segmentation, especially in domains with limited labelled data.In this work, we perform a large-scale evaluation and benchmarking of various pretraining methods for Solar Cell Defect Detection (SCDD) in electroluminescence images, a field with limited labelled datasets.We cover supervised training with semantic segmentation, semi-supervised learning, and two self-supervised techniques.We also experiment with both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) pretraining and observe how this affects downstream performance.The results suggest that supervised training on a large OOD dataset (COCO), self-supervised pretraining on a large OOD dataset (ImageNet), and semi-supervised pretraining (CCT) all yield statistically equivalent performance for mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).We achieve a new state-of-the-art for SCDD and demonstrate that certain pretraining schemes result in superior performance on underrepresented classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we provide a large-scale unlabelled EL image dataset of $22000$ images, and a $642$-image labelled semantic segmentation EL dataset, for further research in developing self- and semi-supervised training techniques in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent efforts have been dedicated to enhancing time series forecasting accuracy by introducing advanced network architectures and self-supervised pretraining strategies.Nevertheless, existing approaches still exhibit two critical drawbacks.Firstly, these methods often rely on a single dataset for training, limiting the model's generalizability due to the restricted scale of the training data.Secondly, the one-step generation schema is widely followed, which necessitates a customized forecasting head and overlooks the temporal dependencies in the output series, and also leads to increased training costs under different horizon length settings.   To address these issues, we propose a novel generative pretrained hierarchical transformer architecture for forecasting, named GPHT.There are two aspects of key designs in GPHT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the one hand, we advocate for constructing a mixed dataset for pretraining our model, comprising various datasets from diverse data scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>This approach significantly expands the scale of training data, allowing our model to uncover commonalities in time series data and facilitating improved transfer to specific datasets.On the other hand, GPHT employs an auto-regressive forecasting approach under the channel-independent assumption, effectively modeling temporal dependencies in the output series.Importantly, no customized forecasting head is required, enabling a single model to forecast at arbitrary horizon settings.We conduct sufficient experiments on eight datasets with mainstream self-supervised pretraining models and supervised models.The results demonstrated that GPHT surpasses the baseline models across various fine-tuning and zero/few-shot learning settings in the traditional long-term forecasting task, providing support for verifying the feasibility of pretrained time series large models.</p>

                  <p>The Fair Graph Anomaly Detection (FairGAD) problem aims to accurately detect anomalous nodes in an input graph while ensuring fairness and avoiding biased predictions against individuals from sensitive subgroups such as gender or political leanings.Fairness in graphs is particularly crucial in anomaly detection areas such as misinformation detection in search/ranking systems, where decision outcomes can significantly affect individuals.However, the current literature does not comprehensively discuss this problem, nor does it provide realistic datasets that encompass actual graph structures, anomaly labels, and sensitive attributes for research in FairGAD.To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal definition of the FairGAD problem and present two novel graph datasets constructed from the globally prominent social media platforms Reddit and Twitter.These datasets comprise 1.2 million and 400,000 edges associated with 9,000 and 47,000 nodes, respectively, and leverage political leanings as sensitive attributes and misinformation spreaders as anomaly labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that our FairGAD datasets significantly differ from the synthetic datasets used currently by the research community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>These new datasets offer significant values for FairGAD by providing realistic data that captures the intricacies of social networks.Using our datasets, we investigate the performance-fairness trade-off in eleven existing GAD and non-graph AD methods on five state-of-the-art fairness methods, which sheds light on their effectiveness and limitations in addressing the FairGAD problem.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots.However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability.Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation.In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc \textbf{C}itation-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{CEG}) approach combined with retrieval argumentation.Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way.It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module.Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations.Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs.Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our codes and dataset will be publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span></p>

                  <p>The use of deep learning models in computational biology has increased massively in recent years, and is expected to do so further with the current advances in fields like Natural Language Processing.These models, although able to draw complex relations between input and target, are also largely inclined to learn noisy deviations from the pool of data used during their development.In order to assess their performance on unseen data (their capacity to generalize), it is common to randomly split the available data in development (train/validation) and test sets.This procedure, although standard, has lately been shown to produce dubious assessments of generalization due to the existing similarity between samples in the databases used.In this work, we present SpanSeq, a database partition method for machine learning that can scale to most biological sequences (genes, proteins and genomes) in order to avoid data leakage between sets.We also explore the effect of not restraining similarity between sets by reproducing the development of the state-of-the-art model DeepLoc, not only confirming the consequences of randomly splitting databases on the model assessment, but expanding those repercussions to the model development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SpanSeq is available for downloading and installing at https://github.com/genomicepidemiology/SpanSeq. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>In subjective NLP tasks, where a single ground truth does not exist, the inclusion of diverse annotators becomes crucial as their unique perspectives significantly influence the annotations.In realistic scenarios, the annotation budget often becomes the main determinant of the number of perspectives (i.e., annotators) included in the data and subsequent modeling.We introduce a novel framework for annotation collection and modeling in subjective tasks that aims to minimize the annotation budget while maximizing the predictive performance for each annotator.Our framework has a two-stage design: first, we rely on a small set of annotators to build a multitask model, and second, we augment the model for a new perspective by strategically annotating a few samples per annotator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To test our framework at scale, we introduce and release a unique dataset, Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus, of 2000 Reddit posts annotated by 24 annotators for moral sentiment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>We demonstrate that our framework surpasses the previous SOTA in capturing the annotators' individual perspectives with as little as 25% of the original annotation budget on two datasets.Furthermore, our framework results in more equitable models, reducing the performance disparity among annotators.</p>

                  <p>Recently, influence functions present an apparatus for achieving explainability for deep neural models by quantifying the perturbation of individual train instances that might impact a test prediction.Our objectives in this paper are twofold.First we incorporate influence functions as a feedback into the model to improve its performance.Second, in a dataset extension exercise, using influence functions to automatically identify data points that have been initially `silver' annotated by some existing method and need to be cross-checked (and corrected) by annotators to improve the model performance.To meet these objectives, in this paper, we introduce InfFeed, which uses influence functions to compute the influential instances for a target instance.Toward the first objective, we adjust the label of the target instance based on its influencer(s) label.In doing this, InfFeed outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (including LLMs) by a maximum macro F1-score margin of almost 4% for hate speech classification, 3.5% for stance classification, and 3% for irony and 2% for sarcasm detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward the second objective we show that manually re-annotating only those silver annotated data points in the extension set that have a negative influence can immensely improve the model performance bringing it very close to the scenario where all the data points in the extension set have gold labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>This allows for huge reduction of the number of data points that need to be manually annotated since out of the silver annotated extension dataset, the influence function scheme picks up ~1/1000 points that need manual correction.</p>

                  <p>Designing molecules with desirable properties, such as drug-likeliness and high binding affinities towards protein targets, is a challenging problem.In this paper, we propose the Dual-Space Optimization (DSO) method that integrates latent space sampling and data space selection to solve this problem.DSO iteratively updates a latent space generative model and a synthetic dataset in an optimization process that gradually shifts the generative model and the synthetic data towards regions of desired property values.Our generative model takes the form of a Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT) where the latent vector serves as the prompt of a causal transformer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method, which sets new performance benchmarks across single-objective, multi-objective and constrained molecule design tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimedia online platforms (e.g., Amazon, TikTok) have greatly benefited from the incorporation of multimedia (e.g., visual, textual, and acoustic) content into their personal recommender systems.These modalities provide intuitive semantics that facilitate modality-aware user preference modeling.However, two key challenges in multi-modal recommenders remain unresolved: i)The introduction of multi-modal encoders with a large number of additional parameters causes overfitting, given high-dimensional multi-modal features provided by extractors (e.g., ViT, BERT).ii) Side information inevitably introduces inaccuracies and redundancies, which skew the modality-interaction dependency from reflecting true user preference.To tackle these problems, we propose to simplify and empower recommenders through Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation (PromptMM) with the prompt-tuning that enables adaptive quality distillation.Specifically, PromptMM conducts model compression through distilling u-i edge relationship and multi-modal node content from cumbersome teachers to relieve students from the additional feature reduction parameters.To bridge the semantic gap between multi-modal context and collaborative signals for empowering the overfitting teacher, soft prompt-tuning is introduced to perform student task-adaptive.Additionally, to adjust the impact of inaccuracies in multimedia data, a disentangled multi-modal list-wise distillation is developed with modality-aware re-weighting mechanism.Experiments on real-world data demonstrate PromptMM's superiority over existing techniques.Ablation tests confirm the effectiveness of key components.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additional tests show the efficiency and effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurately predicting the probabilities of user feedback, such as clicks and conversions, is critical for ad ranking and bidding.However, there often exist unwanted mismatches between predicted probabilities and true likelihoods due to the shift of data distributions and intrinsic model biases.Calibration aims to address this issue by post-processing model predictions, and field-aware calibration can adjust model output on different feature field values to satisfy fine-grained advertising demands.Unfortunately, the observed samples corresponding to certain field values can be too limited to make confident calibrations, which may yield bias amplification and online disturbance.In this paper, we propose a confidence-aware multi-field calibration method, which adaptively adjusts the calibration intensity based on the confidence levels derived from sample statistics.It also utilizes multiple feature fields for joint model calibration with awareness of their importance to mitigate the data sparsity effect of a single field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive offline and online experiments show the superiority of our method in boosting advertising performance and reducing prediction deviations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sequential data naturally arises from user engagement on digital platforms like social media, music streaming services, and web navigation, encapsulating evolving user preferences and behaviors through continuous information streams.A notable unresolved query in stochastic processes is learning mixtures of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs).While there is progress in learning mixtures of discrete-time Markov chains with recovery guarantees [GKV16,ST23,KTT2023], the continuous scenario uncovers unique unexplored challenges.The intrigue in CTMC mixtures stems from their potential to model intricate continuous-time stochastic processes prevalent in various fields including social media, finance, and biology.   In this study, we introduce a novel framework for exploring CTMCs, emphasizing the influence of observed trails' length and mixture parameters on problem regimes, which demands specific algorithms.Through thorough experimentation, we examine the impact of discretizing continuous-time trails on the learnability of the continuous-time mixture, given that these processes are often observed via discrete, resource-demanding observations.Our comparative analysis with leading methods explores sample complexity and the trade-off between the number of trails and their lengths, offering crucial insights for method selection in different problem instances.We apply our algorithms on an extensive collection of Lastfm's user-generated trails spanning three years, demonstrating the capability of our algorithms to differentiate diverse user preferences.We pioneer the use of CTMC mixtures on a basketball passing dataset to unveil intricate offensive tactics of NBA teams.This underscores the pragmatic utility and versatility of our proposed framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All results presented in this study are replicable, and we provide the implementations to facilitate reproducibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>A common problem encountered in many real-world applications is level set estimation where the goal is to determine the region in the function domain where the function is above or below a given threshold.When the function is black-box and expensive to evaluate, the level sets need to be found in a minimum set of function evaluations.Existing methods often assume a discrete search space with a finite set of data points for function evaluations and estimating the level sets.When applied to a continuous search space, these methods often need to first discretize the space which leads to poor results while needing high computational time.While some methods cater for the continuous setting, they still lack a proper guarantee for theoretical convergence.To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that does not need any discretization and can directly work in continuous search spaces.Our method suggests points by constructing an acquisition function that is defined as a measure of confidence of the function being higher or lower than the given threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A theoretical analysis for the convergence of the algorithm to an accurate solution is provided. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>On multiple synthetic and real-world datasets, our algorithm successfully outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Blockchained Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining traction for ensuring the integrity and traceability of FL processes.Blockchained FL involves participants training models locally with their data and subsequently publishing the models on the blockchain, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-like inheritance structure that represents the model relationship.However, this particular DAG-based structure presents challenges in updating models with sensitive data, due to the complexity and overhead involved.To address this, we propose Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a generic framework that redesigns the blockchain structure using Chameleon Hash (CH) technology to mitigate the complexity of model updating, thereby reducing the computational and consensus costs of unlearning tasks.Furthermore, BlockFUL supports various federated unlearning methods, ensuring the integrity and traceability of model updates, whether conducted in parallel or serial.We conduct a comprehensive study of two typical unlearning methods, gradient ascent and re-training, demonstrating the efficient unlearning workflow in these two categories with minimal CH and block update operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we compare the computation and communication costs of these methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern industrial networks transport both best-effort and real-time traffic.Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) was introduced by the IEEE TSN Task Group as an enhancement to Ethernet to provide high quality of service (QoS) for real-time traffic.In a TSN network, applications signal their QoS requirements to the network before transmitting data.The network then allocates resources to meet these requirements.However, TSN-unaware applications can neither perform this registration process nor profit from TSN's QoS benefits.The contributions of this paper are twofold.First, we introduce a novel network architecture in which an additional device autonomously signals the QoS requirements of TSN-unaware applications to the network.Second, we propose a processing method to detect real-time streams in a network and extract the necessary information for the TSN stream signaling.It leverages a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) to detect periodic traffic, extracts an accurate traffic description, and uses traffic classification to determine the source application.As a result, our proposal allows TSN-unaware applications to benefit from TSNs QoS guarantees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluations underline the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and processing method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics.However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure.It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods.In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators.We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias.Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning.Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large-scale high-resolution land cover classification is a prerequisite for constructing Earth system models and addressing ecological and resource issues.Advancements in satellite sensor technology have led to an improvement in spatial resolution and wider coverage areas.Nevertheless, the lack of high-resolution labeled data is still a challenge, hindering the largescale application of land cover classification methods.In this paper, we propose a Transformerbased weakly supervised method for cross-resolution land cover classification using outdated data.First, to capture long-range dependencies without missing the fine-grained details of objects, we propose a U-Net-like Transformer based on a reverse difference mechanism (RDM) using dynamic sparse attention.Second, we propose an anti-noise loss calculation (ANLC) module based on optimal transport (OT).Anti-noise loss calculation identifies confident areas (CA) and vague areas (VA) based on the OT matrix, which relieves the impact of noises in outdated land cover products.By introducing a weakly supervised loss with weights and employing unsupervised loss, the RDM-based U-Net-like Transformer was trained.Remote sensing images with 1 m resolution and the corresponding ground-truths of six states in the United States were employed to validate the performance of the proposed method.The experiments utilized outdated land cover products with 30 m resolution from 2013 as training labels, and produced land cover maps with 1 m resolution from 2017.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/yu-ni1989/ANLC-Former.</p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous graph learning aims to capture complex relationships and diverse relational semantics among entities in a heterogeneous graph to obtain meaningful representations for nodes and edges.Recent advancements in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance by considering relation heterogeneity and using specialized message functions and aggregation rules.However, existing frameworks for heterogeneous graph learning have limitations in generalizing across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets.Most of these frameworks follow the "pre-train" and "fine-tune" paradigm on the same dataset, which restricts their capacity to adapt to new and unseen data.This raises the question: "Can we generalize heterogeneous graph models to be well-adapted to diverse downstream learning tasks with distribution shifts in both node token sets and relation type heterogeneity?''To tackle those challenges, we propose HiGPT, a general large graph model with Heterogeneous graph instruction-tuning paradigm.Our framework enables learning from arbitrary heterogeneous graphs without the need for any fine-tuning process from downstream datasets.To handle distribution shifts in heterogeneity, we introduce an in-context heterogeneous graph tokenizer that captures semantic relationships in different heterogeneous graphs, facilitating model adaptation.We incorporate a large corpus of heterogeneity-aware graph instructions into our HiGPT, enabling the model to effectively comprehend complex relation heterogeneity and distinguish between various types of graph tokens.Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) instruction augmentation paradigm to mitigate data scarcity by generating diverse and informative instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of generalization performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generative AI image models may inadvertently generate problematic representations of people.Past research has noted that millions of users engage daily across the world with these models and that the models, including through problematic representations of people, have the potential to compound and accelerate real-world discrimination and other harms (Bianchi et al, 2023).In this paper, we focus on addressing the generation of problematic associations between demographic groups and semantic concepts that may reflect and reinforce negative narratives embedded in social data.Building on sociological literature (Blumer, 1958) and mapping representations to model behaviors, we have developed a taxonomy to study problematic associations in image generation models.We explore the effectiveness of fine tuning at the model level as a method to address these associations, identifying a potential reduction in visual quality as a limitation of traditional fine tuning.We also propose a new methodology with twice-human-in-the-loop (T-HITL) that promises improvements in both reducing problematic associations and also maintaining visual quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of T-HITL by providing evidence of three problematic associations addressed by T-HITL at the model level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span>Our contributions to scholarship are two-fold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By defining problematic associations in the context of machine learning models and generative AI, we introduce a conceptual and technical taxonomy for addressing some of these associations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Finally, we provide a method, T-HITL, that addresses these associations and simultaneously maintains visual quality of image model generations.This mitigation need not be a tradeoff, but rather an enhancement.</p>

                  <p>Implicit generative models have the capability to learn arbitrary complex data distributions.On the downside, training requires telling apart real data from artificially-generated ones using adversarial discriminators, leading to unstable training and mode-dropping issues.As reported by Zahee et al. (2017), even in the one-dimensional (1D) case, training a generative adversarial network (GAN) is challenging and often suboptimal.In this work, we develop a discriminator-free method for training one-dimensional (1D) generative implicit models and subsequently expand this method to accommodate multivariate cases.Our loss function is a discrepancy measure between a suitably chosen transformation of the model samples and a uniform distribution; hence, it is invariant with respect to the true distribution of the data.We first formulate our method for 1D random variables, providing an effective solution for approximate reparameterization of arbitrary complex distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we consider the temporal setting (both univariate and multivariate), in which we model the conditional distribution of each sample given the history of the process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span>We demonstrate through numerical simulations that this new method yields promising results, successfully learning true distributions in a variety of scenarios and mitigating some of the well-known problems that state-of-the-art implicit methods present.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose AI agents showing comparable performance on many downstream tasks.However, existing work shows that it is challenging for LLMs to integrate structured data (e.g. KG, tables, DBs) into their prompts; LLMs need to either understand long text data or select the most relevant evidence prior to inference, and both approaches are not trivial.   In this paper, we propose a framework, Learning to Reduce, that fine-tunes a language model to generate a reduced version of an input context, given a task description and context input.The model learns to reduce the input context using On-Policy Reinforcement Learning and aims to improve the reasoning performance of a fixed LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results illustrate that our model not only achieves comparable accuracies in selecting the relevant evidence from an input context, but also shows generalizability on different datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>We further show that our model helps improve the LLM's performance on downstream tasks especially when the context is long.</p>
