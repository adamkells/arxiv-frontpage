We used differential privacy as our formal measure of the privacy loss incurred by the released dataset.More concretely, we prove that the released dataset is differentially private with privacy loss budget \varepsilon = 9.98.We extensively used the private selection algorithm of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019) to bundle together multiple steps such as data transformation, model generation algorithm, hyperparameter selection, and evaluation.The model generation algorithm selected was PrivBayes (Zhang et al., SIGMOD 2014).The evaluation was based on a list of acceptance criteria, which were also disclosed only approximately so as to provide an overall differential privacy guarantee.We also discuss concrete challenges and barriers that appear relevant to the next steps of this pilot project, as well as to future differentially private releases.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions.A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data.In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language.By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models.Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span>Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities.The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>The three areas of realistic forward rendering, per-pixel inverse rendering, and generative image synthesis may seem like separate and unrelated sub-fields of graphics and vision.However, recent work has demonstrated improved estimation of per-pixel intrinsic channels (albedo, roughness, metallicity) based on a diffusion architecture; we call this the RGB$\rightarrow$X problem.We further show that the reverse problem of synthesizing realistic images given intrinsic channels, X$\rightarrow$RGB, can also be addressed in a diffusion framework.   Focusing on the image domain of interior scenes, we introduce an improved diffusion model for RGB$\rightarrow$X, which also estimates lighting, as well as the first diffusion X$\rightarrow$RGB model capable of synthesizing realistic images from (full or partial) intrinsic channels.Our X$\rightarrow$RGB model explores a middle ground between traditional rendering and generative models: we can specify only certain appearance properties that should be followed, and give freedom to the model to hallucinate a plausible version of the rest.   This flexibility makes it possible to use a mix of heterogeneous training datasets, which differ in the available channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use multiple existing datasets and extend them with our own synthetic and real data, resulting in a model capable of extracting scene properties better than previous work and of generating highly realistic images of interior scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cued Speech (CS) is an advanced visual phonetic encoding system that integrates lip reading with hand codings, enabling people with hearing impairments to communicate efficiently.CS video generation aims to produce specific lip and gesture movements of CS from audio or text inputs.The main challenge is that given limited CS data, we strive to simultaneously generate fine-grained hand and finger movements, as well as lip movements, meanwhile the two kinds of movements need to be asynchronously aligned.Existing CS generation methods are fragile and prone to poor performance due to template-based statistical models and careful hand-crafted pre-processing to fit the models.Therefore, we propose a novel Gloss-prompted Diffusion-based CS Gesture generation framework (called GlossDiff).Specifically, to integrate additional linguistic rules knowledge into the model.we first introduce a bridging instruction called \textbf{Gloss}, which is an automatically generated descriptive text to establish a direct and more delicate semantic connection between spoken language and CS gestures.Moreover, we first suggest rhythm is an important paralinguistic feature for CS to improve the communication efficacy.Therefore, we propose a novel Audio-driven Rhythmic Module (ARM) to learn rhythm that matches audio speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, in this work, we design, record, and publish the first Chinese CS dataset with four CS cuers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.946</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.We release the code and data at https://glossdiff.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promising results in learning a task-specific policy from a fixed dataset.However, successful offline RL often relies heavily on the coverage and quality of the given dataset.In scenarios where the dataset for a specific task is limited, a natural approach is to improve offline RL with datasets from other tasks, namely, to conduct Multi-Task Data Sharing (MTDS).Nevertheless, directly sharing datasets from other tasks exacerbates the distribution shift in offline RL.In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based MTDS approach that shares the entire dataset without data selection.Given ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, we perform pessimistic value iteration on the shared offline dataset, which provides a unified framework for single- and multi-task offline RL.We further provide theoretical analysis, which shows that the optimality gap of our method is only related to the expected data coverage of the shared dataset, thus resolving the distribution shift issue in data sharing.Empirically, we release an MTDS benchmark and collect datasets from three challenging domains.The experimental results show our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in challenging MTDS problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>See https://github.com/Baichenjia/UTDS for the datasets and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.935</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing demand for computational photography and imaging on mobile platforms has led to the widespread development and integration of advanced image sensors with novel algorithms in camera systems.However, the scarcity of high-quality data for research and the rare opportunity for in-depth exchange of views from industry and academia constrain the development of mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI).Building on the achievements of the previous MIPI Workshops held at ECCV 2022 and CVPR 2023, we introduce our third MIPI challenge including three tracks focusing on novel image sensors and imaging algorithms.In this paper, we summarize and review the Nighttime Flare Removal track on MIPI 2024.In total, 170 participants were successfully registered, and 14 teams submitted results in the final testing phase.The developed solutions in this challenge achieved state-of-the-art performance on Nighttime Flare Removal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More details of this challenge and the link to the dataset can be found at https://mipi-challenge.org/MIPI2024/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization.In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks.Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters.The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task.Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500.For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data.We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal machine translation (MMT) is a challenging task that seeks to improve translation quality by incorporating visual information.However, recent studies have indicated that the visual information provided by existing MMT datasets is insufficient, causing models to disregard it and overestimate their capabilities.This issue presents a significant obstacle to the development of MMT research.This paper presents a novel solution to this issue by introducing 3AM, an ambiguity-aware MMT dataset comprising 26,000 parallel sentence pairs in English and Chinese, each with corresponding images.Our dataset is specifically designed to include more ambiguity and a greater variety of both captions and images than other MMT datasets.We utilize a word sense disambiguation model to select ambiguous data from vision-and-language datasets, resulting in a more challenging dataset.We further benchmark several state-of-the-art MMT models on our proposed dataset.Experimental results show that MMT models trained on our dataset exhibit a greater ability to exploit visual information than those trained on other MMT datasets.Our work provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field of multimodal learning and encourages further exploration in this area.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data, code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/MaxyLee/3AM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on extensive, temporally indiscriminate text corpora, reflecting the lack of datasets with temporal metadata.This approach is not aligned with the evolving nature of language.Conventional methods for creating temporally adapted language models often depend on further pre-training static models on time-specific data.This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative.This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes.This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide access to both the models and training datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing.However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL.Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific.Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity.Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training.In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner.As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.</p>

                  <p>The awareness of multi-cultural human values is critical to the ability of language models (LMs) to generate safe and personalized responses.However, this awareness of LMs has been insufficiently studied, since the computer science community lacks access to the large-scale real-world data about multi-cultural values.In this paper, we present WorldValuesBench, a globally diverse, large-scale benchmark dataset for the multi-cultural value prediction task, which requires a model to generate a rating response to a value question based on demographic contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is derived from an influential social science project, World Values Survey (WVS), that has collected answers to hundreds of value questions (e.g., social, economic, ethical) from 94,728 participants worldwide. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>We have constructed more than 20 million examples of the type "(demographic attributes, value question) $\rightarrow$ answer" from the WVS responses.We perform a case study using our dataset and show that the task is challenging for strong open and closed-source models.On merely $11.1\%$, $25.0\%$, $72.2\%$, and $75.0\%$ of the questions, Alpaca-7B, Vicuna-7B-v1.5, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, and GPT-3.5Turbo can respectively achieve $<0.2$ Wasserstein 1-distance from the human normalized answer distributions.WorldValuesBench opens up new research avenues in studying limitations and opportunities in multi-cultural value awareness of LMs.</p>

                  <p>Data augmentation techniques apply transformations to existing texts to generate additional data.The transformations may produce low-quality texts, where the meaning of the text is changed and the text may even be mangled beyond human comprehension.Analyzing the synthetically generated texts and their corresponding labels is slow and demanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To winnow out texts with incorrect labels, we develop INSPECTOR, a human-in-the-loop data inspection technique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>INSPECTOR combines the strengths of provenance tracking techniques with assistive labeling.INSPECTOR allows users to group related texts by their transformation provenance, i.e., the transformations applied to the original text, or feature provenance, the linguistic features of the original text.For assistive labeling, INSPECTOR computes metrics that approximate data quality, and allows users to compare the corresponding label of each text against the predictions of a large language model.In a user study, INSPECTOR increases the number of texts with correct labels identified by 3X on a sentiment analysis task and by 4X on a hate speech detection task.The participants found grouping the synthetically generated texts by their common transformation to be the most useful technique.Surprisingly, grouping texts by common linguistic features was perceived to be unhelpful.Contrary to prior work, our study finds that no single technique obviates the need for human inspection effort.This validates the design of INSPECTOR which combines both analysis of data provenance and assistive labeling to reduce human inspection effort.</p>

                  <p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) has garnered increasing attention due to its wide range of applications in various fields, including human-machine interaction, virtual assistants, and mental health assistance.However, existing SER methods often overlook the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, resulting in sub-optimal performance.Moreover, current methods require much time for fine-tuning on each specific speech dataset, such as IEMOCAP, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale noisy data.To address these issues, we propose an active learning (AL)-based fine-tuning framework for SER, called \textsc{After}, that leverages task adaptation pre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency.Specifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream speech emotion recognition task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, AL methods are employed to iteratively select a subset of the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, thereby reducing time consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method \textsc{After}, using only 20\% of samples, improves accuracy by 8.45\% and reduces time consumption by 79\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>The additional extension of \textsc{After} and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness and applicability to various real-world scenarios.Our source code is available on Github for reproducibility.(https://github.com/Clearloveyuan/AFTER).</p>

                  <p>Data augmentation serves as a popular regularization technique to combat overfitting challenges in neural networks.While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention.To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement.The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure.During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

A graph is complete partite if there exists a partition of its vertex set such that every pair of vertices from different sets is connected by an edge and vertices from the same set form an independent set.A clique $K_t$ and a bipartite clique $K_{t,t}$ are examples of complete partite graphs.These problems are natural generalizations of the triangle-free and square-free $2$-matching problems in subcubic graphs.In the weighted setting we assume that the weights of edges of $G$ are vertex-induced on every forbidden subgraph.We present simple and fast combinatorial algorithms for these problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The presented algorithms are the first ones for the weighted versions, and for the unweighted ones, are faster than those known previously. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Our approach relies on the use of gadgets with so-called half-edges.A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints.</p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promising results in learning a task-specific policy from a fixed dataset.However, successful offline RL often relies heavily on the coverage and quality of the given dataset.In scenarios where the dataset for a specific task is limited, a natural approach is to improve offline RL with datasets from other tasks, namely, to conduct Multi-Task Data Sharing (MTDS).Nevertheless, directly sharing datasets from other tasks exacerbates the distribution shift in offline RL.In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based MTDS approach that shares the entire dataset without data selection.Given ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, we perform pessimistic value iteration on the shared offline dataset, which provides a unified framework for single- and multi-task offline RL.We further provide theoretical analysis, which shows that the optimality gap of our method is only related to the expected data coverage of the shared dataset, thus resolving the distribution shift issue in data sharing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, we release an MTDS benchmark and collect datasets from three challenging domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in challenging MTDS problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>See https://github.com/Baichenjia/UTDS for the datasets and code.</p>

                  <p>Speech-driven 3D facial animation technology has been developed for years, but its practical application still lacks expectations.The main challenges lie in data limitations, lip alignment, and the naturalness of facial expressions.Although lip alignment has seen many related studies, existing methods struggle to synthesize natural and realistic expressions, resulting in a mechanical and stiff appearance of facial animations.Even with some research extracting emotional features from speech, the randomness of facial movements limits the effective expression of emotions.To address this issue, this paper proposes a method called CSTalk (Correlation Supervised) that models the correlations among different regions of facial movements and supervises the training of the generative model to generate realistic expressions that conform to human facial motion patterns.To generate more intricate animations, we employ a rich set of control parameters based on the metahuman character model and capture a dataset for five different emotions.We train a generative network using an autoencoder structure and input an emotion embedding vector to achieve the generation of user-control expressions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful candidates to inform clinical decision-making processes.While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases?To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations.We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models.Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively.Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications.</p>

                  <p>Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks.But, can they really "reason" over the natural language?This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied.However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored.Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic.Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics.To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule.We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting.Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, they sometimes overlook contextual information necessary for reasoning to arrive at the correct conclusion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs.Data and code are available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/LogicBench.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the rise of Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), i.e., specialized AI systems designed to simulate assigned personas.By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance.RPLAs can mimic a wide range of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions, interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies.We categorize personas into three types: 1) Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2) Character Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3) Individualized Persona, customized through ongoing user interactions for personalized services.We begin by presenting a comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation.Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs.Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI applications, which reflects practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research.Through this work, we aim to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, and facilitate future research in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and RPLAs coexist in harmony.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data.It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications.While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required.Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology.To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems.By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span></p>

Our proposed RL-based approach is able to learn suitable acoustic parameter values which improve the users' ability to correctly identify the state of the robot.2. Algorithm initialization informed by previous user data can be used to significantly speed up the learning process.3.The method used for algorithm initialization strongly influences whether participants converge to similar sounds for each robot state.4. Modulation of pitch bend has the largest influence on user association between sounds and robotic states.</p>

This paper presents a lightweight technique for detecting energy consumption attacks on smart home devices by analyzing received packets.The proposed algorithm considers TCP, UDP, and MQTT protocols, as well as device statuses (Idle, active, under attack).It accounts for resource constraints and promptly alerts administrators upon detecting an attack.The proposed approach effectively identifies energy consumption attacks by measuring packet reception rates for different protocols.</p>

                  <p>The surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) development has led to improved performance on cognitive tasks as well as an urgent need to align these models with human values in order to safely exploit their power.Despite the effectiveness of preference learning algorithms like Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning human preferences, their assumed improvements on model trustworthiness haven't been thoroughly testified.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward this end, this study investigates how models that have been aligned with general-purpose preference data on helpfulness and harmlessness perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>For model alignment, we focus on three widely used RLHF variants: Supervised Finetuning (SFT), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).Through extensive empirical investigations, we discover that the improvement in trustworthiness by RLHF is far from guaranteed, and there exists a complex interplay between preference data, alignment algorithms, and specific trustworthiness aspects.Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment.By shedding light on the intricate dynamics of these components within model alignment, we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are both capable and trustworthy.</p>

                Overcoming Knowledge Barriers: Online Imitation Learning from Observation with Pretrained World Models

                  <p>Incorporating the successful paradigm of pretraining and finetuning from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing into decision-making has become increasingly popular in recent years.In this paper, we study Imitation Learning from Observation with pretrained models and find existing approaches such as BCO and AIME face knowledge barriers, specifically the Embodiment Knowledge Barrier (EKB) and the Demonstration Knowledge Barrier (DKB), greatly limiting their performance.The EKB arises when pretrained models lack knowledge about unseen observations, leading to errors in action inference.The DKB results from policies trained on limited demonstrations, hindering adaptability to diverse scenarios.We thoroughly analyse the underlying mechanism of these barriers and propose AIME-v2 upon AIME as a solution.AIME-v2 uses online interactions with data-driven regulariser to alleviate the EKB and mitigates the DKB by introducing a surrogate reward function to enhance policy training.Experimental results on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of these modifications in improving both sample-efficiency and converged performance.The study contributes valuable insights into resolving knowledge barriers for enhanced decision-making in pretraining-based approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be available at https://github.com/argmax-ai/aime-v2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>
