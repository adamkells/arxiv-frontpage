                  <p>This paper presents an exploration of preference learning in text-to-motion generation.We find that current improvements in text-to-motion generation still rely on datasets requiring expert labelers with motion capture systems.Instead, learning from human preference data does not require motion capture systems; a labeler with no expertise simply compares two generated motions.This is particularly efficient because evaluating the model's output is easier than gathering the motion that performs a desired task (e.g. backflip).To pioneer the exploration of this paradigm, we annotate 3,528 preference pairs generated by MotionGPT, marking the first effort to investigate various algorithms for learning from preference data.In particular, our exploration highlights important design choices when using preference data.Additionally, our experimental results show that preference learning has the potential to greatly improve current text-to-motion generative models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/THU-LYJ-Lab/InstructMotion}{https://github.com/THU-LYJ-Lab/InstructMotion to further facilitate research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKG) store structured world knowledge containing rich multi-modal descriptive information.To overcome their inherent incompleteness, multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover unobserved knowledge from given MMKGs, leveraging both structural information from the triples and multi-modal information of the entities.Existing MMKGC methods usually extract multi-modal features with pre-trained models and employ a fusion module to integrate multi-modal features with triple prediction.However, this often results in a coarse handling of multi-modal data, overlooking the nuanced, fine-grained semantic details and their interactions.To tackle this shortfall, we introduce a novel framework MyGO to process, fuse, and augment the fine-grained modality information from MMKGs.MyGO tokenizes multi-modal raw data as fine-grained discrete tokens and learns entity representations with a cross-modal entity encoder.To further augment the multi-modal representations, MyGO incorporates fine-grained contrastive learning to highlight the specificity of the entity representations.Experiments on standard MMKGC benchmarks reveal that our method surpasses 20 of the latest models, underlining its superior performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/MyGO <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the current artificial intelligence (AI) era, the scale and quality of the dataset play a crucial role in training a high-quality AI model.However, good data is not a free lunch and is always hard to access due to privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to that of the private dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Nevertheless, in some scenarios, it has been found that the attributes needed to train an AI model belong to different parties, and they cannot share the raw data for synthetic data publication due to privacy regulations.In PETS 2023, Xue et al. proposed the first generative adversary network-based model, VertiGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication.However, after thoroughly investigating, we found that VertiGAN is less effective in preserving the correlation among the attributes of different parties.This article proposes a Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network, VFLGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication to address the above issues.Our experimental results show that compared with VertiGAN, VFLGAN significantly improves the quality of synthetic data.Taking the MNIST dataset as an example, the quality of the synthetic dataset generated by VFLGAN is 3.2 times better than that generated by VertiGAN w.r.t.the Fr\'echet Distance.We also designed a more efficient and effective Gaussian mechanism for the proposed VFLGAN to provide the synthetic dataset with a differential privacy guarantee.On the other hand, differential privacy only gives the upper bound of the worst-case privacy guarantee.This article also proposes a practical auditing scheme that applies membership inference attacks to estimate privacy leakage through the synthetic dataset.</p>

                  <p>Datasets are essential for training and testing vehicle perception algorithms.However, the collection and annotation of real-world images is time-consuming and expensive.Driving simulators offer a solution by automatically generating various driving scenarios with corresponding annotations, but the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap remains a challenge.While most of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) follows the de facto Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)-based methods, the recent emerging diffusion probabilistic models have not been fully explored in mitigating Sim2Real challenges for driving data synthesis.To explore the performance, this paper applied three different generative AI methods to leverage semantic label maps from a driving simulator as a bridge for the creation of realistic datasets.A comparative analysis of these methods is presented from the perspective of image quality and perception.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>New synthetic datasets, which include driving images and auto-generated high-quality annotations, are produced with low costs and high scene variability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>The experimental results show that although GAN-based methods are adept at generating high-quality images when provided with manually annotated labels, ControlNet produces synthetic datasets with fewer artefacts and more structural fidelity when using simulator-generated labels.This suggests that the diffusion-based approach may provide improved stability and an alternative method for addressing Sim2Real challenges.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous agents that accomplish complex computer tasks with minimal human interventions have the potential to transform human-computer interaction, significantly enhancing accessibility and productivity.However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability.To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications.Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation.Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants.While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge.Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable insights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, environment, baseline models, and data are publicly available at https://os-world.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recommender models aimed at mining users' behavioral patterns have raised great attention as one of the essential applications in daily life.Recent work on graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkable gains.However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddings caused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution of interactions due to popularity and user-individual biases.This paper proposes a contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec).To overcome the over-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator that can select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing both structural context and sequential context.To tackle the skewed distribution, we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modeling individual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating item popularity with positional encoding.Moreover, we mathematically show that the imbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularity bias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/CaDRec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph neural network (GNN)-based models have been extensively studied for recommendations, as they can extract high-order collaborative signals accurately which is required for high-quality recommender systems.However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating.In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback.To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations.Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process.The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions.Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/NFARec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems.Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals.Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli.Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states.Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations.To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds.In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids.Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective.We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations.In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction.Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals.Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data.We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.887</span></span>We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module.Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a new research direction for online Multi-Level Aggregation (MLA) with delays.In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted rooted tree $T$, and we have to serve a sequence of requests arriving at its vertices in an online manner.Each request $r$ is characterized by two parameters: its arrival time $t(r)$ and location $l(r)$ (a vertex).Once a request $r$ arrives, we can either serve it immediately or postpone this action until any time $t > t(r)$. We can serve several pending requests at the same time, and the service cost of a service corresponds to the weight of the subtree that contains all the requests served and the root of $T$. Postponing the service of a request $r$ to time $t >t(r)$ generates an additional delay cost of $t - t(r)$. The goal is to serve all requests in an online manner such that the total cost (i.e., the total sum of service and delay costs) is minimized.The current best algorithm for this problem achieves a competitive ratio of $O(d^2)$ (Azar and Touitou, FOCS'19), where $d$ denotes the depth of the tree.   Here, we consider a stochastic version of MLA where the requests follow a Poisson arrival process.We present a deterministic online algorithm which achieves a constant ratio of expectations, meaning that the ratio between the expected costs of the solution generated by our algorithm and the optimal offline solution is bounded by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is obtained by carefully combining two strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>In the first one, we plan periodic oblivious visits to the subset of frequent vertices, whereas in the second one, we greedily serve the pending requests in the remaining vertices.This problem is complex enough to demonstrate a very rare phenomenon that ``single-minded" or ``sample-average" strategies are not enough in stochastic optimization.</p>

                  <p>One of the notorious issues for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is poor sample efficiency.Compared to single agent RL, the sample efficiency for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is more challenging because of its inherent partial observability, non-stationary training, and enormous strategy space.Although much effort has been devoted to developing new methods and enhancing sample efficiency, we look at the widely used episodic training mechanism.In each training step, tens of frames are collected, but only one gradient step is made.We argue that this episodic training could be a source of poor sample efficiency.To better exploit the data already collected, we propose to increase the frequency of the gradient updates per environment interaction (a.k.a.

                  <p>Over the past decade, a series of unflagging efforts have been dedicated to developing highly expressive and controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems.In general, the holistic TTS comprises two interconnected components: the frontend module and the backend module.The frontend excels in capturing linguistic representations from the raw text input, while the backend module converts linguistic cues to speech.The research community has shown growing interest in the study of the frontend component, recognizing its pivotal role in text-to-speech systems, including Text Normalization (TN), Prosody Boundary Prediction (PBP), and Polyphone Disambiguation (PD).Nonetheless, the limitations posed by insufficient annotated textual data and the reliance on homogeneous text signals significantly undermine the effectiveness of its supervised learning.To evade this obstacle, a novel two-stage TTS frontend prediction pipeline, named TAP-FM, is proposed in this paper.Specifically, during the first learning phase, we present a Multi-scale Contrastive Text-audio Pre-training protocol (MC-TAP), which hammers at acquiring richer insights via multi-granularity contrastive pre-training in an unsupervised manner.Instead of mining homogeneous features in prior pre-training approaches, our framework demonstrates the ability to delve deep into both global and local text-audio semantic and acoustic representations.Furthermore, a parallelized TTS frontend model is delicately devised to execute TN, PD, and PBP prediction tasks, respectively in the second stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive experiments illustrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a novel approach that allows for collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy by leveraging models trained on decentralized devices.However, FL faces challenges due to non-uniformly distributed (non-iid) data across clients, which impacts model performance and its generalization capabilities.To tackle the non-iid issue, recent efforts have utilized the global model as a teaching mechanism for local models.However, our pilot study shows that their effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced data distribution, which induces biases in local models and leads to a 'local forgetting' phenomenon, where the ability of models to generalize degrades over time, particularly for underrepresented classes.This paper introduces FedDistill, a framework enhancing the knowledge transfer from the global model to local models, focusing on the issue of imbalanced class distribution.Specifically, FedDistill employs group distillation, segmenting classes based on their frequency in local datasets to facilitate a focused distillation process to classes with fewer samples.Additionally, FedDistill dissects the global model into a feature extractor and a classifier.This separation empowers local models with more generalized data representation capabilities and ensures more accurate classification across all classes.FedDistill mitigates the adverse effects of data imbalance, ensuring that local models do not forget underrepresented classes but instead become more adept at recognizing and classifying them accurately.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FedDistill's effectiveness, surpassing existing baselines in accuracy and convergence speed across several benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) trains agents to accomplish complex tasks through environmental interaction data, but its capacity is also limited by the scope of the available data.To obtain a knowledgeable agent, a promising approach is to leverage the knowledge from large language models (LLMs).Despite previous studies combining LLMs with RL, seamless integration of the two components remains challenging due to their semantic gap.This paper introduces a novel method, Knowledgeable Agents from Language Model Rollouts (KALM), which extracts knowledge from LLMs in the form of imaginary rollouts that can be easily learned by the agent through offline reinforcement learning methods.The primary challenge of KALM lies in LLM grounding, as LLMs are inherently limited to textual data, whereas environmental data often comprise numerical vectors unseen to LLMs.To address this, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform various tasks based on environmental data, including bidirectional translation between natural language descriptions of skills and their corresponding rollout data.This grounding process enhances the LLM's comprehension of environmental dynamics, enabling it to generate diverse and meaningful imaginary rollouts that reflect novel skills.Initial empirical evaluations on the CLEVR-Robot environment demonstrate that KALM enables agents to complete complex rephrasings of task goals and extend their capabilities to novel tasks requiring unprecedented optimal behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KALM achieves a success rate of 46% in executing tasks with unseen goals, substantially surpassing the 26% success rate achieved by baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Furthermore, KALM effectively enables the LLM to comprehend environmental dynamics, resulting in the generation of meaningful imaginary rollouts that reflect novel skills and demonstrate the seamless integration of large language models and reinforcement learning.</p>

                  <p>Key-value sequence data has become ubiquitous and naturally appears in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from the user-product purchasing sequences in e-commerce, to network packet sequences forwarded by routers in networking.Classifying these key-value sequences is important in many scenarios such as user profiling and malicious applications identification.In many time-sensitive scenarios, besides the requirement of classifying a key-value sequence accurately, it is also desired to classify a key-value sequence early, in order to respond fast.However, these two goals are conflicting in nature, and it is challenging to achieve them simultaneously.In this work, we formulate a novel tangled key-value sequence early classification problem, where a tangled key-value sequence is a mixture of several concurrent key-value sequences with different keys.The goal is to classify each individual key-value sequence sharing a same key both accurately and early.To address this problem, we propose a novel method, i.e., Key-Value sequence Early Co-classification (KVEC), which leverages both inner- and inter-correlations of items in a tangled key-value sequence through key correlation and value correlation to learn a better sequence representation.Meanwhile, a time-aware halting policy decides when to stop the ongoing key-value sequence and classify it based on current sequence representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KVEC improves the prediction accuracy by up to $4.7 - 17.5\%$ under the same prediction earliness condition, and improves the harmonic mean of accuracy and earliness by up to $3.7 - 14.0\%$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Novel view synthesis aims to generate new view images of a given view image collection.Recent attempts address this problem relying on 3D geometry priors (e.g., shapes, sizes, and positions) learned from multi-view images.However, such methods encounter the following limitations: 1) they require a set of multi-view images as training data for a specific scene (e.g., face, car or chair), which is often unavailable in many real-world scenarios; 2) they fail to extract the geometry priors from single-view images due to the lack of multi-view supervision.In this paper, we propose a Geometry-enhanced NeRF (G-NeRF), which seeks to enhance the geometry priors by a geometry-guided multi-view synthesis approach, followed by a depth-aware training.In the synthesis process, inspired that existing 3D GAN models can unconditionally synthesize high-fidelity multi-view images, we seek to adopt off-the-shelf 3D GAN models, such as EG3D, as a free source to provide geometry priors through synthesizing multi-view data.Simultaneously, to further improve the geometry quality of the synthetic data, we introduce a truncation method to effectively sample latent codes within 3D GAN models.To tackle the absence of multi-view supervision for single-view images, we design the depth-aware training approach, incorporating a depth-aware discriminator to guide geometry priors through depth maps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios.Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains.However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost.More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm.In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding.Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality.This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors.Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

                  <p>Graph neural network (GNN)-based models have been extensively studied for recommendations, as they can extract high-order collaborative signals accurately which is required for high-quality recommender systems.However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating.In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback.To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations.Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process.The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/NFARec.</p>

                  <p>We propose a novel method to estimate a driver's points-of-gaze using a pair of ordinary cameras mounted on the windshield and dashboard of a car.This is a challenging problem due to the dynamics of traffic environments with 3D scenes of unknown depths.This problem is further complicated by the volatile distance between the driver and the camera system.To tackle these challenges, we develop a novel convolutional network that simultaneously analyzes the image of the scene and the image of the driver's face.This network has a camera calibration module that can compute an embedding vector that represents the spatial configuration between the driver and the camera system.This calibration module improves the overall network's performance, which can be jointly trained end to end.   We also address the lack of annotated data for training and evaluation by introducing a large-scale driving dataset with point-of-gaze annotations.This is an in situ dataset of real driving sessions in an urban city, containing synchronized images of the driving scene as well as the face and gaze of the driver.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on this dataset show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, having the mean prediction error of 29.69 pixels, which is relatively small compared to the $1280{\times}720$ resolution of the scene camera. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent research has shown that incorporating bug-related facts, such as stack traces and GitHub issues, into prompts enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs?To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark.Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial.Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM's performance on a given task instance.We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair.Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt.This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set.To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked Maniple against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods.On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, Maniple repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.</p>

                  <p>Automated Driving (AD) systems have the potential to increase safety, comfort and energy efficiency.Recently, major automotive companies have started testing and validating AD systems (ADS) on public roads.Nevertheless, the commercial deployment and wide adoption of ADS have been moderate, partially due to system functional insufficiencies (FI) that undermine passenger safety and lead to hazardous situations on the road.FIs are defined in ISO 21448 Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF).FIs are insufficiencies in sensors, actuators and algorithm implementations, including neural networks and probabilistic calculations.Examples of FIs in ADS include inaccurate ego-vehicle localization on the road, incorrect prediction of a cyclist maneuver, unreliable detection of a pedestrian, etc.   The main goal of our study is to formulate a generic architectural design pattern, which is compatible with existing methods and ADS, to improve FI mitigation and enable faster commercial deployment of ADS.First, we studied the 2021 autonomous vehicles disengagement reports published by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data clearly show that disengagements are five times more often caused by FIs rather than by system faults.We then made a comprehensive list of insufficiencies and their characteristics by analyzing over 10 hours of publicly available road test videos.In particular, we identified insufficiency types in four major categories: world model, motion plan, traffic rule, and operational design domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The insufficiency characterization helps making the SOTIF analyses of triggering conditions more systematic and comprehensive.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span>Based on our FI characterization, simulation experiments and literature survey, we define a novel generic architectural design pattern Daruma to dynamically select the channel that is least likely to have a FI at the moment.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful way to pre-train generalizable machine learning models on large amounts of unlabeled data.It is particularly compelling in the music domain, where obtaining labeled data is time-consuming, error-prone, and ambiguous.During the self-supervised process, models are trained on pretext tasks, with the primary objective of acquiring robust and informative features that can later be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.The choice of the pretext task is critical as it guides the model to shape the feature space with meaningful constraints for information encoding.In the context of music, most works have relied on contrastive learning or masking techniques.In this study, we expand the scope of pretext tasks applied to music by investigating and comparing the performance of new self-supervised methods for music tagging.We open-source a simple ResNet model trained on a diverse catalog of millions of tracks.Our results demonstrate that, although most of these pre-training methods result in similar downstream results, contrastive learning consistently results in better downstream performance compared to other self-supervised pre-training methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This holds true in a limited-data downstream context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span></p>

                  <p>In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic.LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly.Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations.To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries.   Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple clients without raw data exposure.However, recent studies have shown that clients' private training data can be reconstructed from the gradients they share in FL, known as gradient inversion attacks (GIAs).While GIAs have demonstrated effectiveness under \emph{ideal settings and auxiliary assumptions}, their actual efficacy against \emph{practical FL systems} remains under-explored.To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study on GIAs in this work.We start with a survey of GIAs that establishes a milestone to trace their evolution and develops a systematization to uncover their inherent threats.Specifically, we categorize the auxiliary assumptions used by existing GIAs based on their practical accessibility to potential adversaries.To facilitate deeper analysis, we highlight the challenges that GIAs face in practical FL systems from three perspectives: \textit{local training}, \textit{model}, and \textit{post-processing}.We then perform extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations of state-of-the-art GIAs across diverse settings, utilizing eight datasets and thirteen models.Our findings indicate that GIAs have inherent limitations when reconstructing data under practical local training settings.Furthermore, their efficacy is sensitive to the trained model, and even simple post-processing measures applied to gradients can be effective defenses.Overall, our work provides crucial insights into the limited effectiveness of GIAs in practical FL systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By rectifying prior misconceptions, we hope to inspire more accurate and realistic investigations on this topic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span></p>

                  <p>A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA).In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems.The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy.This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills.With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty.Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems.Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD), also referred to as outlier detection, is a statistical process aimed at identifying observations within a dataset that significantly deviate from the expected pattern of the majority of the data.Such a process finds wide application in various fields, such as finance and healthcare.While the primary objective of AD is to yield high detection accuracy, the requirements of explainability and privacy are also paramount.The first ensures the transparency of the AD process, while the second guarantees that no sensitive information is leaked to untrusted parties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we exploit the trade-off of applying Explainable AI (XAI) through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and differential privacy (DP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span>We perform AD with different models and on various datasets, and we thoroughly evaluate the cost of privacy in terms of decreased accuracy and explainability.Our results show that the enforcement of privacy through DP has a significant impact on detection accuracy and explainability, which depends on both the dataset and the considered AD model.We further show that the visual interpretation of explanations is also influenced by the choice of the AD algorithm.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become instrumental in advancing software engineering (SE) tasks, showcasing their efficacy in code understanding and beyond.Like traditional SE tools, open-source collaboration is key in realising the excellent products.However, with AI models, the essential need is in data.The collaboration of these AI-based SE models hinges on maximising the sources of high-quality data.However, data especially of high quality, often holds commercial or sensitive value, making it less accessible for open-source AI-based SE projects.This reality presents a significant barrier to the development and enhancement of AI-based SE tools within the software engineering community.Therefore, researchers need to find solutions for enabling open-source AI-based SE models to tap into resources by different organisations.Addressing this challenge, our position paper investigates one solution to facilitate access to diverse organizational resources for open-source AI models, ensuring privacy and commercial sensitivities are respected.We introduce a governance framework centered on federated learning (FL), designed to foster the joint development and maintenance of open-source AI code models while safeguarding data privacy and security.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present guidelines for developers on AI-based SE tool collaboration, covering data requirements, model architecture, updating strategies, and version control. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Given the significant influence of data characteristics on FL, our research examines the effect of code data heterogeneity on FL performance.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI based on foundation models provides a first glimpse into the world represented by machines trained on vast amounts of multimodal data ingested by these models during training.If we consider the resulting models as knowledge bases in their own right, this may open up new avenues for understanding places through the lens of machines.In this work, we adopt this thinking and select GPT-4, a state-of-the-art representative in the family of multimodal large language models, to study its geographic diversity regarding how well geographic features are represented.Using DBpedia abstracts as a ground-truth corpus for probing, our natural language--based geo-guessing experiment shows that GPT-4 may currently encode insufficient knowledge about several geographic feature types on a global level.On a local level, we observe not only this insufficiency but also inter-regional disparities in GPT-4's geo-guessing performance on UNESCO World Heritage Sites that carry significance to both local and global populations, and the inter-regional disparities may become smaller as the geographic scale increases.Morever, whether assessing the geo-guessing performance on a global or local level, we find inter-model disparities in GPT-4's geo-guessing performance when comparing its unimodal and multimodal variants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope this work can initiate a discussion on geographic diversity as an ethical principle within the GIScience community in the face of global socio-technical challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span></p>
