                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown remarkable perceptual capability in answering visual questions, however, little is known about the limits of their perception.In particular, while prior works have provided anecdotal evidence of MLLMs' sensitivity to object size, this phenomenon and its underlying causes have not been explored comprehensively.In this work, we quantitatively study the perception of small visual objects in several state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a pervasive limitation in answering questions about small objects in images.Next, we identify four independent factors that can contribute to this limitation -- object quality, size, distractors, and location -- and conduct controlled intervention studies to measure the effect of each factor on MLLMs' perception.In particular, we find that lower object quality and smaller object size can both independently reduce MLLMs' ability to answer visual questions.More surprisingly, we find that the location of the object in the image and the presence of visual distractors can also significantly reduce MLLMs' question answering accuracy.Our study provides a better understanding of the perceptual limitation of MLLMs and contributes new evaluation protocols for analyzing the perception of future MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further investigations, we release our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface.In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph.While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs.In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning.Toward this goal, we first develop our Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks.Then, we propose our G-Retriever approach, which integrates the strengths of GNNs, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting.To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem.Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and resists hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(Our codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever.) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Guidance for assemblable parts is a promising field for augmented reality.Augmented reality assembly guidance requires 6D object poses of target objects in real time.Especially in time-critical medical or industrial settings, continuous and markerless tracking of individual parts is essential to visualize instructions superimposed on or next to the target object parts.In this regard, occlusions by the user's hand or other objects and the complexity of different assembly states complicate robust and real-time markerless multi-object tracking.To address this problem, we present Graph-based Object Tracking (GBOT), a novel graph-based single-view RGB-D tracking approach.The real-time markerless multi-object tracking is initialized via 6D pose estimation and updates the graph-based assembly poses.The tracking through various assembly states is achieved by our novel multi-state assembly graph.We update the multi-state assembly graph by utilizing the relative poses of the individual assembly parts.Linking the individual objects in this graph enables more robust object tracking during the assembly process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset of publicly available and 3D printable assembly assets as a benchmark for future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Quantitative experiments in synthetic data and further qualitative study in real test data show that GBOT can outperform existing work towards enabling context-aware augmented reality assembly guidance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and code will be made publically available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.916</span></span></p>

                  <p>Loneliness is a growing health concern as it can lead to depression and other associated mental health problems for people who experience feelings of loneliness over prolonged periods of time.Utilizing passive sensing methods that use smartphone and wearable sensor data to capture daily behavioural patterns offers a promising approach for the early detection of loneliness.Given the subjective nature of loneliness and people's varying daily routines, past detection approaches using machine learning models often face challenges with effectively detecting loneliness.This paper proposes a methodologically novel approach, particularly developing a loneliness detection system that evolves over time, adapts to new data, and provides real-time detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study utilized the Globem dataset, a comprehensive collection of passive sensing data acquired over 10 weeks from university students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>The base of our approach is the continuous identification and refinement of similar behavioural groups among students using an incremental clustering method.As we add new data, the model improves based on changing behavioural patterns.Parallel to this, we create and update classification models to detect loneliness among the evolving behavioural groups of students.When unique behavioural patterns are observed among student data, specialized classification models have been created.For predictions of loneliness, a collaborative effort between the generalized and specialized models is employed, treating each prediction as a vote.This study's findings reveal that group-based loneliness detection models exhibit superior performance compared to generic models, underscoring the necessity for more personalized approaches tailored to specific behavioural patterns.These results pave the way for future research, emphasizing the development of finely-tuned, individualized mental health interventions.</p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual illusions play a significant role in understanding visual perception.Current methods in understanding and evaluating visual illusions are mostly deterministic filtering based approach and they evaluate on a handful of visual illusions, and the conclusions therefore, are not generic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we generate a large-scale dataset of 22,366 images (BRI3L: BRightness Illusion Image dataset for Identification and Localization of illusory perception) of the five types of brightness illusions and benchmark the dataset using data-driven neural network based approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>The dataset contains label information - (1) whether a particular image is illusory/nonillusory, (2) the segmentation mask of the illusory region of the image.Hence, both the classification and segmentation task can be evaluated using this dataset.We follow the standard psychophysical experiments involving human subjects to validate the dataset.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a dataset of visual illusions and benchmark using data-driven approach for illusion classification and localization.We consider five well-studied types of brightness illusions: 1) Hermann grid, 2) Simultaneous Brightness Contrast, 3) White illusion, 4) Grid illusion, and 5)Induced Grating illusion.Benchmarking on the dataset achieves 99.56% accuracy in illusion identification and 84.37% pixel accuracy in illusion localization.The application of deep learning model, it is shown, also generalizes over unseen brightness illusions like brightness assimilation to contrast transitions.We also test the ability of state-of-theart diffusion models to generate brightness illusions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have provided all the code, dataset, instructions etc in the github repo: https://github.com/aniket004/BRI3L <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation for robotic grasping.However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to fewer visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs.To address this issue, we propose a texture-agnostic approach that focuses on learning from CAD models and emphasizes object shape features.To achieve a focus on learning shape features, the textures are randomized during the rendering of the training data.By treating the texture as noise, the need for real-world object instances or their final appearance during training data generation is eliminated.The TLESS and ITODD datasets, specifically created for industrial settings in robotics and featuring textureless and metallic objects, were used for evaluation.Texture agnosticity also increases the robustness against image perturbations such as imaging noise, motion blur, and brightness changes, which are common in robotics applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets are publicly available at github.com/hoenigpeter/randomized_texturing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Alqueva Multi-Purpose Project (EFMA) is a massive abduction and storage infrastructure system in the Alentejo, which has a water quality monitoring network with almost thousands of water quality stations distributed across three subsystems: Alqueva, Pedrog\~ao, and Ardila.Identification of pollution sources in complex infrastructure systems, such as the EFMA, requires recognition of water flow direction and delimitation of areas being drained to specific sampling points.The transfer channels in the EFMA infrastructure artificially connect several water bodies that do not share drainage basins, which further complicates the interpretation of water quality data because the water does not flow exclusively downstream and is not restricted to specific basins.   The existing user-friendly GIS tools do not facilitate the exploration and visualisation of water quality data in spatial-temporal dimensions, such as defining temporal relationships between monitoring campaigns, nor do they allow the establishment of topological and hydrological relationships between different sampling points.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This thesis work proposes a framework capable of aggregating many types of information in a GIS environment, visualising large water quality-related datasets and, a graph data model to integrate and relate water quality between monitoring stations and land use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The graph model allows to exploit the relationship between water quality in a watercourse and reservoirs associated with infrastructures.

                  <p>Deep neural networks have useful applications in many different tasks, however their performance can be severely affected by changes in the data distribution.For example, in the biomedical field, their performance can be affected by changes in the data (different machines, populations) between training and test datasets.To ensure robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, test-time adaptation has been recently studied as an approach to adjust models to a new data distribution during inference.Test-time batch normalization is a simple and popular method that achieved compelling performance on domain shift benchmarks.It is implemented by recalculating batch normalization statistics on test batches.Prior work has focused on analysis with test data that has the same label distribution as the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in many practical applications this technique is vulnerable to label distribution shifts, sometimes producing catastrophic failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>This presents a risk in applying test time adaptation methods in deployment.We propose to tackle this challenge by only selectively adapting channels in a deep network, minimizing drastic adaptation that is sensitive to label shifts.Our selection scheme is based on two principles that we empirically motivate: (1) later layers of networks are more sensitive to label shift (2) individual features can be sensitive to specific classes.We apply the proposed technique to three classification tasks, including CIFAR10-C, Imagenet-C, and diagnosis of fatty liver, where we explore both covariate and label distribution shifts.We find that our method allows to bring the benefits of TTA while significantly reducing the risk of failure common in other methods, while being robust to choice in hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer utilizing multilingual LLMs has become a popular learning paradigm for low-resource languages with no labeled training data.However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods.Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues.Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies.This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data.We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages.The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment.</p>

                  <p>Generating sufficient labeled data is a significant hurdle in the efficient execution of deep learning projects, especially in uncharted territories of image segmentation where labeling demands extensive time, unlike classification tasks.Our study confronts this challenge, operating in an environment constrained by limited hardware resources and the lack of extensive datasets or pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the novel use of Inconsistency Masks (IM) to effectively filter uncertainty in image-pseudo-label pairs, substantially elevating segmentation quality beyond traditional semi-supervised learning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>By integrating IM with other methods, we demonstrate remarkable binary segmentation performance on the ISIC 2018 dataset, starting with just 10% labeled data.Notably, three of our hybrid models outperform those trained on the fully labeled dataset.Our approach consistently achieves exceptional results across three additional datasets and shows further improvement when combined with other techniques.For comprehensive and robust evaluation, this paper includes an extensive analysis of prevalent semi-supervised learning strategies, all trained under identical starting conditions.The full code is available at: https://github.com/MichaelVorndran/InconsistencyMasks</p>

                  <p>We study a sequential binary prediction setting where the forecaster is evaluated in terms of the calibration distance, which is defined as the $L_1$ distance between the predicted values and the set of predictions that are perfectly calibrated in hindsight.This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the offline setting.The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the $L_1$ calibration error and its variants.   We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We then show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class.   On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps).Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.</p>

                  <p>Feature selection is a key step when dealing with high dimensional data.In particular, these techniques simplify the process of knowledge discovery from the data by selecting the most relevant features out of the noisy, redundant and irrelevant features.A problem that arises in many of these practical applications is that the outcome of the feature selection algorithm is not stable.Thus, small variations in the data may yield very different feature rankings.Assessing the stability of these methods becomes an important issue in the previously mentioned situations.We propose an information theoretic approach based on the Jensen Shannon divergence to quantify this robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike other stability measures, this metric is suitable for different algorithm outcomes: full ranked lists, feature subsets as well as the lesser studied partial ranked lists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>This generalized metric quantifies the difference among a whole set of lists with the same size, following a probabilistic approach and being able to give more importance to the disagreements that appear at the top of the list.Moreover, it possesses desirable properties including correction for change, upper lower bounds and conditions for a deterministic selection.We illustrate the use of this stability metric with data generated in a fully controlled way and compare it with popular metrics including the Spearmans rank correlation and the Kunchevas index on feature ranking and selection outcomes, respectively.Additionally, experimental validation of the proposed approach is carried out on a real-world problem of food quality assessment showing its potential to quantify stability from different perspectives.</p>

                  <p>In Software Product Lines (SPLs) it may be difficult or even impossible to test all the products of the family because of the large number of valid feature combinations that may exist.Thus, we want to find a minimal subset of the product family that allows us to test all these possible combinations (pairwise).Furthermore, when testing a single product is a great effort, it is desirable to first test products composed of a set of priority features.This problem is called Prioritized Pairwise Test Data Generation Problem.   State-of-the-art algorithms based on Integer Linear Programming for this problema are faster enough for small and medium instances.However, there exists some real instances that are too large to be computed with these algorithms in a reasonable time because of the exponential growth of the number of candidate solutions.Also, these heuristics not always lead us to the best solutions.In this work we propose a new approach based on a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt.We compare this matheuristic with four algorithms: a Hybrid algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming ((HILP), a Hybrid algorithm based on Integer Nonlinear Programming (HINLP), the Parallel Prioritized Genetic Solver (PPGS), and a greedy algorithm called prioritized-ICPL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The analysis reveals that CMSA results in statistically significantly better quality solutions in most instances and for most levels of weighted coverage, although it requires more execution time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel unsupervised technique that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to determine the most suitable dense retriever for a specific test(target) corpus.Selecting the appropriate dense retriever is vital for numerous IR applications that employ these retrievers, trained on public datasets, to encode or conduct searches within a new private target corpus.The effectiveness of a dense retriever can significantly diminish when applied to a target corpus that diverges in domain or task from the original training set.The problem becomes more pronounced in cases where the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g. in zero-shot scenarios, rendering direct evaluation of the model's effectiveness on the target corpus unattainable.Therefore, the unsupervised selection of an optimally pre-trained dense retriever, especially under conditions of domain shift, emerges as a critical challenge.Existing methodologies for ranking dense retrievers fall short in addressing these domain shift scenarios.   To tackle this, our method capitalizes on LLMs to create pseudo-relevant queries, labels, and reference lists by analyzing a subset of documents from the target corpus.This allows for the ranking of dense retrievers based on their performance with these pseudo-relevant signals.Significantly, this strategy is the first to depend exclusively on the target corpus data, removing the necessity for training data and test labels.We assessed the effectiveness of our approach by compiling a comprehensive pool of cutting-edge dense retrievers and comparing our method against traditional dense retriever selection benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The findings reveal that our proposed solution surpasses the existing benchmarks in both the selection and ranking of dense retrievers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have useful applications in many different tasks, however their performance can be severely affected by changes in the data distribution.For example, in the biomedical field, their performance can be affected by changes in the data (different machines, populations) between training and test datasets.To ensure robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios, test-time adaptation has been recently studied as an approach to adjust models to a new data distribution during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Test-time batch normalization is a simple and popular method that achieved compelling performance on domain shift benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>It is implemented by recalculating batch normalization statistics on test batches.Prior work has focused on analysis with test data that has the same label distribution as the training data.However, in many practical applications this technique is vulnerable to label distribution shifts, sometimes producing catastrophic failure.This presents a risk in applying test time adaptation methods in deployment.We propose to tackle this challenge by only selectively adapting channels in a deep network, minimizing drastic adaptation that is sensitive to label shifts.Our selection scheme is based on two principles that we empirically motivate: (1) later layers of networks are more sensitive to label shift (2) individual features can be sensitive to specific classes.We apply the proposed technique to three classification tasks, including CIFAR10-C, Imagenet-C, and diagnosis of fatty liver, where we explore both covariate and label distribution shifts.We find that our method allows to bring the benefits of TTA while significantly reducing the risk of failure common in other methods, while being robust to choice in hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>Graphical models capture relations between entities in a wide range of applications including social networks, biology, and natural language processing, among others.Graph neural networks (GNN) are neural models that operate over graphs, enabling the model to leverage the complex relationships and dependencies in graph-structured data.A graph explanation is a subgraph which is an `almost sufficient' statistic of the input graph with respect to its classification label.Consequently, the classification label is invariant, with high probability, to perturbations of graph edges not belonging to its explanation subgraph.This work considers two methods for leveraging such perturbation invariances in the design and training of GNNs.First, explanation-assisted learning rules are considered.It is shown that the sample complexity of explanation-assisted learning can be arbitrarily smaller than explanation-agnostic learning.Next, explanation-assisted data augmentation is considered, where the training set is enlarged by artificially producing new training samples via perturbation of the non-explanation edges in the original training set.It is shown that such data augmentation methods may improve performance if the augmented data is in-distribution, however, it may also lead to worse sample complexity compared to explanation-agnostic learning rules if the augmented data is out-of-distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical evaluations are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained considerable traction for their capability to effectively process topological data, yet their interpretability remains a critical concern.Current interpretation methods are dominated by post-hoc explanations to provide a transparent and intuitive understanding of GNNs.However, they have limited performance in interpreting complicated subgraphs and can't utilize the explanation to advance GNN predictions.On the other hand, transparent GNN models are proposed to capture critical subgraphs.While such methods could improve GNN predictions, they usually don't perform well on explanations.Thus, it is desired for a new strategy to better couple GNN explanation and prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we have developed a novel interpretable causal GNN framework that incorporates retrieval-based causal learning with Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) theory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework could semi-parametrically retrieve crucial subgraphs detected by GIB and compress the explanatory subgraphs via a causal module. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>The framework was demonstrated to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, and to achieve 32.71\% higher precision on real-world explanation scenarios with diverse explanation types.More importantly, the learned explanations were shown able to also improve GNN prediction performance.</p>

We consider several problems to demonstrate the performance of the framework in learning both static and time-dependent PDEs on non-rigid geometries; these include solving the Laplace equation, reaction-diffusion equations, and a multiscale PDE that characterizes the electrical propagation on the left ventricle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work paves the way toward the fast prediction of PDE solutions on a family of domains and the application of neural operators in engineering and precision medicine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

Empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trigger detection and detection-evading attack strategy.For trigger detection, our distribution discrepancy-based solution can achieve a 100\% detection rate for the Trojan triggers used in the existing works.For evading trigger detection, our proposed stealthy trigger design approach performs end-to-end learning to make the distribution of poisoned noise input approach that of benign noise, enabling nearly 100\% detection pass rate with very high attack and benign performance for the backdoored diffusion models.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel visual prompting approach for VLMs that we call Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization (PIVOT), which casts tasks as iterative visual question answering.In each iteration, the image is annotated with a visual representation of proposals that the VLM can refer to (e.g., candidate robot actions, localizations, or trajectories).The VLM then selects the best ones for the task.These proposals are iteratively refined, allowing the VLM to eventually zero in on the best available answer.We investigate PIVOT on real-world robotic navigation, real-world manipulation from images, instruction following in simulation, and additional spatial inference tasks such as localization.We find, perhaps surprisingly, that our approach enables zero-shot control of robotic systems without any robot training data, navigation in a variety of environments, and other capabilities.Although current performance is far from perfect, our work highlights potentials and limitations of this new regime and shows a promising approach for Internet-Scale VLMs in robotic and spatial reasoning domains.Website: pivot-prompt.github.io and HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/spaces/pivot-prompt/pivot-prompt-demo.</p>

                You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal Bayesian Inference for Semantic and Property Prediction
