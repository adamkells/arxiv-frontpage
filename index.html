                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to perform well on exclusive, multi-class classification tasks.However, when different classes have similar visual features, it becomes challenging for human annotators to differentiate them.This scenario necessitates the use of composite class labels.In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hyper-Evidential Neural Network (HENN) that explicitly models predictive uncertainty due to composite class labels in training data in the context of the belief theory called Subjective Logic (SL).By placing a grouped Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural network as parameters of hyper-subjective opinions and learn the network that collects both single and composite evidence leading to these hyper-opinions by a deterministic DNN from data.We introduce a new uncertainty type called vagueness originally designed for hyper-opinions in SL to quantify composite classification uncertainty for DNNs.Our results demonstrate that HENN outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts based on four image datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Hugo101/HyperEvidentialNN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages.As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce.   Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language.However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work.This has limited progress in the field.This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem.Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation.Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach.   By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign.Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation.Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens.Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network.Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.889</span></span>An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in the field of predictive maintenance for wind turbines, yet the comparison of different algorithms poses a difficult task because domain specific public datasets are scarce.Many comparisons of different approaches either use benchmarks composed of data from many different domains, inaccessible data or one of the few publicly available datasets which lack detailed information about the faults.Moreover, many publications highlight a couple of case studies where fault detection was successful.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this paper we publish a high quality dataset that contains data from 36 wind turbines across 3 different wind farms as well as the most detailed fault information of any public wind turbine dataset as far as we know. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The new dataset contains 89 years worth of real-world operating data of wind turbines, distributed across 44 labeled time frames for anomalies that led up to faults, as well as 51 time series representing normal behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>Additionally, the quality of training data is ensured by turbine-status-based labels for each data point.Furthermore, we propose a new scoring method, called CARE (Coverage, Accuracy, Reliability and Earliness), which takes advantage of the information depth that is present in the dataset to identify a good all-around anomaly detection model.This score considers the anomaly detection performance, the ability to recognize normal behavior properly and the capability to raise as few false alarms as possible while simultaneously detecting anomalies early.</p>

                  <p>Intelligent communications have played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of 6G networks.Native artificial intelligence (AI) within green communication systems must meet stringent real-time requirements.To achieve this, deploying lightweight and resource-efficient AI models is necessary.However, as wireless networks generate a multitude of data fields and indicators during operation, only a fraction of them imposes significant impact on the network AI models.Therefore, real-time intelligence of communication systems heavily relies on a small but critical set of the data that profoundly influences the performance of network AI models.These challenges underscore the need for innovative architectures and solutions.In this paper, we propose a solution, termed the pervasive multi-level (PML) native AI architecture, which integrates the concept of knowledge graph (KG) into the intelligent operational manipulations of mobile networks, resulting in the establishment of a wireless data KG.Leveraging the wireless data KG, we characterize the massive and complex data collected from wireless communication networks and analyze the relationships among various data fields.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The obtained graph of data field relations enables the on-demand generation of minimal and effective datasets, referred to as feature datasets, tailored to specific application requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Consequently, this architecture not only enhances AI training, inference, and validation processes but also significantly reduces resource wastage and overhead for communication networks.To implement this architecture, we have developed a specific solution comprising a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph attention neural network model (STREAM) as well as a feature dataset generation algorithm.Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.</p>

                  <p>Task-oriented grasping (TOG), which refers to the problem of synthesizing grasps on an object that are configurationally compatible with the downstream manipulation task, is the first milestone towards tool manipulation.Analogous to the activation of two brain regions responsible for semantic and geometric reasoning during cognitive processes, modeling the complex relationship between objects, tasks, and grasps requires rich prior knowledge about objects and tasks.Existing methods typically limit the prior knowledge to a closed-set scope and cannot support the generalization to novel objects and tasks out of the training set.To address such a limitation, we propose FoundationGrasp, a foundation model-based TOG framework that leverages the open-ended knowledge from foundation models to learn generalizable TOG skills.Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the contributed Language and Vision Augmented TaskGrasp (LaViA-TaskGrasp) dataset, demonstrating the superiority of FoudationGrasp over existing methods when generalizing to novel object instances, object classes, and tasks out of the training set.Furthermore, the effectiveness of FoudationGrasp is validated in real-robot grasping and manipulation experiments on a 7 DoF robotic arm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, data, appendix, and video are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/foundationgrasp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKG) store structured world knowledge containing rich multi-modal descriptive information.To overcome their inherent incompleteness, multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover unobserved knowledge from given MMKGs, leveraging both structural information from the triples and multi-modal information of the entities.Existing MMKGC methods usually extract multi-modal features with pre-trained models and employ a fusion module to integrate multi-modal features with triple prediction.However, this often results in a coarse handling of multi-modal data, overlooking the nuanced, fine-grained semantic details and their interactions.To tackle this shortfall, we introduce a novel framework MyGO to process, fuse, and augment the fine-grained modality information from MMKGs.MyGO tokenizes multi-modal raw data as fine-grained discrete tokens and learns entity representations with a cross-modal entity encoder.To further augment the multi-modal representations, MyGO incorporates fine-grained contrastive learning to highlight the specificity of the entity representations.Experiments on standard MMKGC benchmarks reveal that our method surpasses 20 of the latest models, underlining its superior performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/MyGO <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables the recognition of novel classes by leveraging semantic knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories.This knowledge, typically encapsulated in attribute descriptions, aids in identifying class-specific visual features, thus facilitating visual-semantic alignment and improving ZSL performance.However, real-world challenges such as distribution imbalances and attribute co-occurrence among instances often hinder the discernment of local variances in images, a problem exacerbated by the scarcity of fine-grained, region-specific attribute annotations.Moreover, the variability in visual presentation within categories can also skew attribute-category associations.In response, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal ZSL approach CREST.It begins by extracting representations for attribute and visual localization and employs Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to measure underlying epistemic uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against hard negatives.CREST incorporates dual learning pathways, focusing on both visual-category and attribute-category alignments, to ensure robust correlation between latent and observable spaces.Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty-informed cross-modal fusion technique to refine visual-attribute inference.Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's effectiveness and unique explainability across multiple datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are available at: Comments: Ongoing work; 10 pages, 2 Tables, 9 Figures; Repo is available at https://github.com/JethroJames/CREST. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span></p>

                  <p>Datasets are essential for training and testing vehicle perception algorithms.However, the collection and annotation of real-world images is time-consuming and expensive.Driving simulators offer a solution by automatically generating various driving scenarios with corresponding annotations, but the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap remains a challenge.While most of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) follows the de facto Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)-based methods, the recent emerging diffusion probabilistic models have not been fully explored in mitigating Sim2Real challenges for driving data synthesis.To explore the performance, this paper applied three different generative AI methods to leverage semantic label maps from a driving simulator as a bridge for the creation of realistic datasets.A comparative analysis of these methods is presented from the perspective of image quality and perception.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>New synthetic datasets, which include driving images and auto-generated high-quality annotations, are produced with low costs and high scene variability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>The experimental results show that although GAN-based methods are adept at generating high-quality images when provided with manually annotated labels, ControlNet produces synthetic datasets with fewer artefacts and more structural fidelity when using simulator-generated labels.This suggests that the diffusion-based approach may provide improved stability and an alternative method for addressing Sim2Real challenges.</p>

                  <p>In recent decades, the vision community has witnessed remarkable progress in visual recognition, partially owing to advancements in dataset benchmarks.Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems.However, the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade.Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions, which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations.These annotations, executed by different groups of raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types.In this study, we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks.To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by human raters.We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks.</p>

                  <p>Anthropogenic ecological crisis constitutes a significant challenge that all within the academy must urgently face, including the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.While recent years have seen increasing work revolving around climate-centric discourse, crucial environmental and ecological topics outside of climate change remain largely unaddressed, despite their prominent importance.Mainstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, dominate the scene, but there remains an untouched space in the literature involving the analysis of environmental impacts of certain events and practices.To address this gap, this paper presents EcoVerse, an annotated English Twitter dataset of 3,023 tweets spanning a wide spectrum of environmental topics.We propose a three-level annotation scheme designed for Eco-Relevance Classification, Stance Detection, and introducing an original approach for Environmental Impact Analysis.We detail the data collection, filtering, and labeling process that led to the creation of the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkable Inter-Annotator Agreement indicates that the annotation scheme produces consistent annotations of high quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Subsequent classification experiments using BERT-based models, including ClimateBERT, are presented.These yield encouraging results, while also indicating room for a model specifically tailored for environmental texts.The dataset is made freely available to stimulate further research.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a model of online algorithms subject to strict constraints on data retention.An online learning algorithm encounters a stream of data points, one per round, generated by some stationary process.Crucially, each data point can request that it be removed from memory $m$ rounds after it arrives.To model the impact of removal, we do not allow the algorithm to store any information or calculations between rounds other than a subset of the data points (subject to the retention constraints).At the conclusion of the stream, the algorithm answers a statistical query about the full dataset.We ask: what level of performance can be guaranteed as a function of $m$?   We illustrate this framework for multidimensional mean estimation and linear regression problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show it is possible to obtain an exponential improvement over a baseline algorithm that retains all data as long as possible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Specifically, we show that $m = \textsc{Poly}(d, \log(1/\epsilon))$ retention suffices to achieve mean squared error $\epsilon$ after observing $O(1/\epsilon)$ $d$-dimensional data points.This matches the error bound of the optimal, yet infeasible, algorithm that retains all data forever.We also show a nearly matching lower bound on the retention required to guarantee error $\epsilon$. One implication of our results is that data retention laws are insufficient to guarantee the right to be forgotten even in a non-adversarial world in which firms merely strive to (approximately) optimize the performance of their algorithms.   Our approach makes use of recent developments in the multidimensional random subset sum problem to simulate the progression of stochastic gradient descent under a model of adversarial noise, which may be of independent interest.</p>

                  <p>ICD(International Classification of Diseases) coding involves assigning ICD codes to patients visit based on their medical notes.ICD coding is a challenging multilabel text classification problem due to noisy medical document inputs.Recent advancements in automated ICD coding have enhanced performance by integrating additional data and knowledge bases with the encoding of medical notes and codes.However, most of them ignore the code hierarchy, leading to improper code assignments.To address these problems, we propose a novel framework based on associated and hierarchical code description distillation (AHDD) for better code representation learning and avoidance of improper code assignment.we utilize the code description and the hierarchical structure inherent to the ICD codes.Therefore, in this paper, we leverage the code description and the hierarchical structure inherent to the ICD codes.The code description is also applied to aware the attention layer and output layer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show the superiority of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>Trajectory streams are being generated from location-aware devices, such as smartphones and in-vehicle navigation systems.Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues.Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis.Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications.To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams.Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection.We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality.The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy.We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open set recognition (OSR) is a critical aspect of machine learning, addressing the challenge of detecting novel classes during inference.Within the realm of deep learning, neural classifiers trained on a closed set of data typically struggle to identify novel classes, leading to erroneous predictions.To address this issue, various heuristic methods have been proposed, allowing models to express uncertainty by stating "I don't know."However, a gap in the literature remains, as there has been limited exploration of the underlying mechanisms of these methods.In this paper, we conduct an analysis of open set recognition methods, focusing on the aspect of feature diversity.Our research reveals a significant correlation between learning diverse discriminative features and enhancing OSR performance.Building on this insight, we propose a novel OSR approach that leverages the advantages of feature diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The efficacy of our method is substantiated through rigorous evaluation on a standard OSR testbench, demonstrating a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories.Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts.However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation.In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO).Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward.Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data.Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm.OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target but usually requires simultaneous access to both source and target data.Moreover, UDA approaches commonly assume that source and target domains share the same labels space.Yet, these two assumptions are hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios.This paper considers the more challenging Source-Free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting, where both assumptions are dropped.We propose a novel approach for SF-OSDA that exploits the granularity of target-private categories by segregating their samples into multiple unknown classes.Starting from an initial clustering-based assignment, our method progressively improves the segregation of target-private samples by refining their pseudo-labels with the guide of an uncertainty-based sample selection module.Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive loss, named NL-InfoNCELoss, that, integrating negative learning into self-supervised contrastive learning, enhances the model robustness to noisy pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.88</span></span>Notably, additional analyses show that our method is able to learn the underlying semantics of novel classes, opening the possibility to perform novel class discovery.</p>

                  <p>A key challenge in contrastive learning is to generate negative samples from a large sample set to contrast with positive samples, for learning better encoding of the data.These negative samples often follow a softmax distribution which are dynamically updated during the training process.However, sampling from this distribution is non-trivial due to the high computational costs in computing the partition function.In this paper, we propose an Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo negative sampling method for Contrastive learning (EMC$^2$).We follow the global contrastive learning loss as introduced in SogCLR, and propose EMC$^2$ which utilizes an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings subroutine to generate hardness-aware negative samples in an online fashion during the optimization.We prove that EMC$^2$ finds an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$-stationary point of the global contrastive loss in $T$ iterations.Compared to prior works, EMC$^2$ is the first algorithm that exhibits global convergence (to stationarity) regardless of the choice of batch size while exhibiting low computation and memory cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical experiments validate that EMC$^2$ is effective with small batch training and achieves comparable or better performance than baseline algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We report the results for pre-training image encoders on STL-10 and Imagenet-100.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a new research direction for online Multi-Level Aggregation (MLA) with delays.In this problem, we are given an edge-weighted rooted tree $T$, and we have to serve a sequence of requests arriving at its vertices in an online manner.Each request $r$ is characterized by two parameters: its arrival time $t(r)$ and location $l(r)$ (a vertex).Once a request $r$ arrives, we can either serve it immediately or postpone this action until any time $t > t(r)$. We can serve several pending requests at the same time, and the service cost of a service corresponds to the weight of the subtree that contains all the requests served and the root of $T$. Postponing the service of a request $r$ to time $t >t(r)$ generates an additional delay cost of $t - t(r)$. The goal is to serve all requests in an online manner such that the total cost (i.e., the total sum of service and delay costs) is minimized.The current best algorithm for this problem achieves a competitive ratio of $O(d^2)$ (Azar and Touitou, FOCS'19), where $d$ denotes the depth of the tree.   Here, we consider a stochastic version of MLA where the requests follow a Poisson arrival process.We present a deterministic online algorithm which achieves a constant ratio of expectations, meaning that the ratio between the expected costs of the solution generated by our algorithm and the optimal offline solution is bounded by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is obtained by carefully combining two strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>In the first one, we plan periodic oblivious visits to the subset of frequent vertices, whereas in the second one, we greedily serve the pending requests in the remaining vertices.This problem is complex enough to demonstrate a very rare phenomenon that ``single-minded" or ``sample-average" strategies are not enough in stochastic optimization.</p>

                  <p>One of the notorious issues for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is poor sample efficiency.Compared to single agent RL, the sample efficiency for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is more challenging because of its inherent partial observability, non-stationary training, and enormous strategy space.Although much effort has been devoted to developing new methods and enhancing sample efficiency, we look at the widely used episodic training mechanism.In each training step, tens of frames are collected, but only one gradient step is made.We argue that this episodic training could be a source of poor sample efficiency.To better exploit the data already collected, we propose to increase the frequency of the gradient updates per environment interaction (a.k.a. Replay Ratio or Update-To-Data ratio).To show its generality, we evaluate $3$ MARL methods on $6$ SMAC tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results validate that a higher replay ratio significantly improves the sample efficiency for MARL algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>The codes to reimplement the results presented in this paper are open-sourced at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rr_for_MARL-0D83/.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity among software engineers.A crucial aspect of developing effective code-generation LLMs is to evaluate these models using a robust benchmark.Evaluation benchmarks with quality issues can provide a false sense of performance.In this work, we conduct the first-of-its-kind study of the quality of prompts within benchmarks used to compare the performance of different code generation models.To conduct this study, we analyzed 3,566 prompts from 9 code generation benchmarks to identify quality issues in them.We also investigated whether fixing the identified quality issues in the benchmarks' prompts affects a model's performance.We also studied memorization issues of the evaluation dataset, which can put into question a benchmark's trustworthiness.We found that code generation evaluation benchmarks mainly focused on Python and coding exercises and had very limited contextual dependencies to challenge the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These datasets and the developers' prompts suffer from quality issues like spelling and grammatical errors, unclear sentences to express developers' intent, and not using proper documentation style. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Fixing all these issues in the benchmarks can lead to a better performance for Python code generation, but not a significant improvement was observed for Java code generation.We also found evidence that GPT-3.5-Turbo and CodeGen-2.5 models possibly have data contamination issues.</p>

                  <p>Recent research has shown that incorporating bug-related facts, such as stack traces and GitHub issues, into prompts enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs?To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark.Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial.Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM's performance on a given task instance.We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair.Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt.This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set.To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked Maniple against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods.On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, Maniple repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to capture comprehensive user preferences in order to ultimately enhance the recommendation accuracy in both data-richer and data-sparser domains simultaneously.However, in addition to users' true preferences, the user-item interactions might also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion).As a result, dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions, while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding framework via Confounder Disentanglement for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called CD2CDR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then propose a causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing the recommendation accuracy in each domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that CD2CDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>In text-based person search endeavors, data generation has emerged as a prevailing practice, addressing concerns over privacy preservation and the arduous task of manual annotation.Although the number of synthesized data can be infinite in theory, the scientific conundrum persists that how much generated data optimally fuels subsequent model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observe that only a subset of the data in these constructed datasets plays a decisive role. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Therefore, we introduce a new Filtering-WoRA paradigm, which contains a filtering algorithm to identify this crucial data subset and WoRA (Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation) learning strategy for light fine-tuning.The filtering algorithm is based on the cross-modality relevance to remove the lots of coarse matching synthesis pairs.As the number of data decreases, we do not need to fine-tune the entire model.Therefore, we propose a WoRA learning strategy to efficiently update a minimal portion of model parameters.WoRA streamlines the learning process, enabling heightened efficiency in extracting knowledge from fewer, yet potent, data instances.Extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of pretraining, where our model achieves advanced and efficient retrieval performance on challenging real-world benchmarks.Notably, on the CUHK-PEDES dataset, we have achieved a competitive mAP of 67.02% while reducing model training time by 19.82%.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful way to pre-train generalizable machine learning models on large amounts of unlabeled data.It is particularly compelling in the music domain, where obtaining labeled data is time-consuming, error-prone, and ambiguous.During the self-supervised process, models are trained on pretext tasks, with the primary objective of acquiring robust and informative features that can later be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.The choice of the pretext task is critical as it guides the model to shape the feature space with meaningful constraints for information encoding.In the context of music, most works have relied on contrastive learning or masking techniques.In this study, we expand the scope of pretext tasks applied to music by investigating and comparing the performance of new self-supervised methods for music tagging.We open-source a simple ResNet model trained on a diverse catalog of millions of tracks.Our results demonstrate that, although most of these pre-training methods result in similar downstream results, contrastive learning consistently results in better downstream performance compared to other self-supervised pre-training methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This holds true in a limited-data downstream context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span></p>

                  <p>In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic.LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly.Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations.To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries.   Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Recently, scientists have proposed several deep learning models to monitor the diversity of bird species.These models can detect bird species with high accuracy by analyzing acoustic signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, traditional deep learning algorithms are black-box models that provide no insight into their decision-making process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>For domain experts, such as ornithologists, it is crucial that these models are not only efficient, but also interpretable in order to be used as assistive tools.In this study, we present an adaption of the Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet) for audio classification that provides inherent interpretability through its model architecture.Our approach is based on a ConvNeXt backbone architecture for feature extraction and learns prototypical patterns for each bird species using spectrograms of the training data.Classification of new data is done by comparison with these prototypes in latent space, which simultaneously serve as easily understandable explanations for the model's decisions.</p>

                  <p>A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA).In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems.The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy.This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills.With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty.Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems.Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.</p>

                  <p>The Indian classical dance-drama Kathakali has a set of hand gestures called Mudras, which form the fundamental units of all its dance moves and postures.Recognizing the depicted mudra becomes one of the first steps in its digital processing.The work treats the problem as a 24-class classification task and proposes a vector-similarity-based approach using pose estimation, eliminating the need for further training or fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach overcomes the challenge of data scarcity that limits the application of AI in similar domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>The method attains 92% accuracy which is a similar or better performance as other model-training-based works existing in the domain, with the added advantage that the method can still work with data sizes as small as 1 or 5 samples with a slightly reduced performance.Working with images, videos, and even real-time streams is possible.The system can work with hand-cropped or full-body images alike.We have developed and made public a dataset for the Kathakali Mudra Recognition as part of this work.</p>

                  <p>Trajectory streams are being generated from location-aware devices, such as smartphones and in-vehicle navigation systems.Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues.Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis.Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications.To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams.Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy.We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios.The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus.While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts.With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online.To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.575</span></span>On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy.Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses.</p>
