                  <p>Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases.The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost has led to an exponential increase in patient-level GV data.This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management.To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged.However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations.This poses the question: How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs?We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges.We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named GV-Rep, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts.Our contributions are three-fold: (i) Construction of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically verified GVs from real-world patients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(ii) Analysis of the structure and properties of the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>(iii) Experimentation of the dataset with pre-trained GFMs.The results show a significant gap between GFMs current capabilities and accurate GV representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope this dataset will help advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Financial risks trend to spread from one entity to another, ultimately leading to systemic risks.The key to preventing such risks lies in understanding the causal chains behind risk contagion.Despite this, prevailing approaches primarily emphasize identifying risks, overlooking the underlying causal analysis of risk.To address such an issue, we propose a Risk Contagion Causal Reasoning model called RC2R, which uses the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to dissect the causal mechanisms of risk contagion grounded in the factual and expert knowledge embedded within financial knowledge graphs (KGs).At the data level, we utilize financial KGs to construct causal instructions, empowering LLMs to perform formal causal reasoning on risk propagation and tackle the "causal parrot" problem of LLMs.In terms of model architecture, we integrate a fusion module that aligns tokens and nodes across various granularities via multi-scale contrastive learning, followed by the amalgamation of textual and graph-structured data through soft prompt with cross multi-head attention mechanisms.To quantify risk contagion, we introduce a risk pathway inference module for calculating risk scores for each node in the graph.Finally, we visualize the risk contagion pathways and their intensities using Sankey diagrams, providing detailed causal explanations.Comprehensive experiments on financial KGs and supply chain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will make our dataset and code publicly accessible to encourage further research and development in this field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image inpainting, or image completion, is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to restore missing or damaged regions of images with semantically coherent content.This technique requires a precise balance of local texture replication and global contextual understanding to ensure the restored image integrates seamlessly with its surroundings.Traditional methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective at capturing local patterns but often struggle with broader contextual relationships due to the limited receptive fields.Recent advancements have incorporated transformers, leveraging their ability to understand global interactions.However, these methods face computational inefficiencies and struggle to maintain fine-grained details.To overcome these challenges, we introduce MxT composed of the proposed Hybrid Module (HM), which combines Mamba with the transformer in a synergistic manner.Mamba is adept at efficiently processing long sequences with linear computational costs, making it an ideal complement to the transformer for handling long-scale data interactions.Our HM facilitates dual-level interaction learning at both pixel and patch levels, greatly enhancing the model to reconstruct images with high quality and contextual accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate MxT on the widely-used CelebA-HQ and Places2-standard datasets, where it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span></p>

                  <p>The interest in mobile platforms across a variety of applications has increased significantly in recent years.One of the reasons is the ability to achieve accurate navigation by using low-cost sensors.To this end, inertial sensors are fused with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals.GNSS outages during platform operation can result in pure inertial navigation, causing the navigation solution to drift.In such situations, periodic trajectories with dedicated algorithms were suggested to mitigate the drift.With periodic dynamics, inertial deep learning approaches can capture the motion more accurately and provide accurate dead-reckoning for drones and mobile robots.In this paper, we propose approaches to extend deep learning-assisted inertial sensing and fusion capabilities during periodic motion.We begin by demonstrating that fusion between GNSS and inertial sensors in periodic trajectories achieves better accuracy compared to straight-line trajectories.Next, we propose an empowered network architecture to accurately regress the change in distance of the platform.Utilizing this network, we drive a hybrid approach for a neural-inertial fusion filter.Finally, we utilize this approach for situations when GNSS is available and show its benefits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A dataset of 337 minutes of data collected from inertial sensors mounted on a mobile robot and a quadrotor is used to evaluate our approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-grained understanding of objects, attributes, and relationships between objects is crucial for visual-language models (VLMs).Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar \textit{captions} given an image.In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed \textbf{Vis}ual \textbf{Min}imal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions.The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: \textit{object}, \textit{attribute}, \textit{count}, and \textit{spatial relation}.These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects.We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators.Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>We release all resources, including the benchmark, training data, and finetuned model checkpoints, at \url{https://vismin.net/}.</p>

                  <p>Estimating abnormal posture based on 3D pose is vital in human pose analysis, yet it presents challenges, especially when reconstructing 3D human poses from monocular datasets with occlusions.Accurate reconstructions enable the restoration of 3D movements, which assist in the extraction of semantic details necessary for analyzing abnormal behaviors.However, most existing methods depend on predefined key points as a basis for estimating the coordinates of occluded joints, where variations in data quality have adversely affected the performance of these models.In this paper, we present OAD2D, which discriminates against motion abnormalities based on reconstructing 3D coordinates of mesh vertices and human joints from monocular videos.The OAD2D employs optical flow to capture motion prior information in video streams, enriching the information on occluded human movements and ensuring temporal-spatial alignment of poses.Moreover, we reformulate the abnormal posture estimation by coupling it with Motion to Text (M2T) model in which, the VQVAE is employed to quantize motion features.This approach maps motion tokens to text tokens, allowing for a semantically interpretable analysis of motion, and enhancing the generalization of abnormal posture detection boosted by Language model.Our approach demonstrates the robustness of abnormal behavior detection against severe and self-occlusions, as it reconstructs human motion trajectories in global coordinates to effectively mitigate occlusion issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, validated using the Human3.6M, 3DPW, and NTU RGB+D datasets, achieves a high $F_1-$Score of 0.94 on the NTU RGB+D dataset for medical condition detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>And we will release all of our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span></p>

                  <p>Due to the varying intensity of pavement cracks, the complexity of topological structure, and the noise of texture background, image classification for asphalt pavement cracking has proven to be a challenging problem.Fatigue cracking, also known as alligator cracking, is one of the common distresses of asphalt pavement.It is thus important to detect and monitor the condition of alligator cracking on roadway pavements.Most research in this area has typically focused on pixel-level detection of cracking using limited datasets.A novel deep convolutional neural network that can achieve two objectives is proposed.The first objective of the proposed neural network is to classify presence of fatigue cracking based on pavement surface images.The second objective is to classify the fatigue cracking severity level based on the Distress Identification Manual (DIM) standard.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, a databank of 4484 high-resolution pavement surface images is established in which images are taken locally in the Town of Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>In the data pre-preparation, over 4000 images are labeled into 4 categories manually according to DIM standards.A four-layer convolutional neural network model is then built to achieve the goal of classification of images by pavement crack severity category.The trained model reached the highest accuracy among all existing methods.After only 30 epochs of training, the model achieved a crack existence classification accuracy of 96.23% and a severity level classification accuracy of 96.74%.After 20 epochs of training, the model achieved a pavement marking presence classification accuracy of 97.64%.</p>

                  <p>The latest breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), eg., ChatDev, have catalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent collaboration for software development.LLM agents can collaborate in teams like humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on requirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to perform autonomous software generation.However, for an agent team, each phase in a single development process yields only one possible outcome.This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space.Consequently, this may lead to obtaining suboptimal results.To address this challenge, we introduce Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation.Experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of our framework.The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our framework across various domains.We anticipate that our work will guide LLM agents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth in but not limited to software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding inter-object relations, i.e., interactions or associations between distinct objects, remains a major challenge for such models.This issue significantly hinders their advanced reasoning capabilities and is primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse multi-modal data essential for training and evaluating MLLMs.In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of inter-object relations and introduce Multi-Modal Relation Understanding (MMRel), a comprehensive dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing large-scale, high-quality and diverse data for studying inter-object relations with MLLMs.MMRel features three distinctive attributes: (i) It includes over 15K question-answer pairs, which are sourced from three distinct domains, ensuring large scale and high diversity; (ii) It contains a subset featuring highly unusual relations, on which MLLMs often fail due to hallucinations, thus are very challenging; (iii) It provides manually verified high-quality labels for inter-object relations.Thanks to these features, MMRel is ideal for evaluating MLLMs on relation understanding, as well as being used to fine-tune MLLMs to enhance relation understanding and even benefit overall performance in various vision-language tasks.Extensive experiments on various popular MLLMs validate the effectiveness of MMRel.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both MMRel dataset and the complete labeling scripts have been made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.88</span></span></p>

                  <p>The quality of Virtual Reality (VR) apps is vital, particularly the rendering quality of the VR Graphical User Interface (GUI).Different from traditional 2D apps, VR apps create a 3D digital scene for users, by rendering two distinct 2D images for the user's left and right eyes, respectively.Stereoscopic visual inconsistency (denoted as "SVI") issues, however, undermine the rendering process of the user's brain, leading to user discomfort and even adverse health effects.Such issues commonly exist but remain underexplored.We conduct an empirical analysis on 282 SVI bug reports from 15 VR platforms, summarizing 15 types of manifestations.The empirical analysis reveals that automatically detecting SVI issues is challenging, mainly because: (1) lack of training data; (2) the manifestations of SVI issues are diverse, complicated, and often application-specific; (3) most accessible VR apps are closed-source commercial software.Existing pattern-based supervised classification approaches may be inapplicable or ineffective in detecting the SVI issues.To counter these challenges, we propose an unsupervised black-box testing framework named StereoID to identify the stereoscopic visual inconsistencies, based only on the rendered GUI states.StereoID generates a synthetic right-eye image based on the actual left-eye image and computes distances between the synthetic right-eye image and the actual right-eye image to detect SVI issues.We propose a depth-aware conditional stereo image translator to power the image generation process, which captures the expected perspective shifts between left-eye and right-eye images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build a large-scale unlabeled VR stereo screenshot dataset with larger than 171K images from 288 real-world VR apps for experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>After substantial experiments, StereoID demonstrates superior performance for detecting SVI issues in both user reports and wild VR apps.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable advancements in various fields using large, well-annotated datasets.However, real-world data often exhibit long-tailed distributions and label noise, significantly degrading generalization performance.Recent studies addressing these issues have focused on noisy sample selection methods that estimate the centroid of each class based on high-confidence samples within each target class.The performance of these methods is limited because they use only the training samples within each class for class centroid estimation, making the quality of centroids susceptible to long-tailed distributions and noisy labels.In this study, we present a robust training framework called Distribution-aware Sample Selection and Contrastive Learning (DaSC).Specifically, DaSC introduces a Distribution-aware Class Centroid Estimation (DaCC) to generate enhanced class centroids.DaCC performs weighted averaging of the features from all samples, with weights determined based on model predictions.Additionally, we propose a confidence-aware contrastive learning strategy to obtain balanced and robust representations.The training samples are categorized into high-confidence and low-confidence samples.Our method then applies Semi-supervised Balanced Contrastive Loss (SBCL) using high-confidence samples, leveraging reliable label information to mitigate class bias.For the low-confidence samples, our method computes Mixup-enhanced Instance Discrimination Loss (MIDL) to improve their representations in a self-supervised manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results on CIFAR and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DaSC compared to previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, introducing Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods into unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has been a rising research point.A tensor structure is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps relieve the computation burden.However, while existing methods exploit TD to minimize the reconstruction error of a data tensor, they don't fully utilize the interpretable and discriminative information in the factor matrices.Moreover, most methods require domain knowledge to perform feature selection.To solve the above problems, we develop two Sparse Tensor Principal Component Analysis (STPCA) models that utilize the projection directions in the factor matrices to perform UFS.The first model extends Tucker Decomposition to a multiview sparse regression form and is transformed into several alternatively solved convex subproblems.The second model formulates a sparse version of the family of Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVDs) and is transformed into individual convex subproblems.For both models, we prove the optimal solution of each subproblem falls onto the Hermitian Positive Semidefinite Cone (HPSD).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Accordingly, we design two fast algorithms based on HPSD projection and prove their convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>According to the experimental results on two original synthetic datasets (Orbit and Array Signal) and five real-world datasets, the two proposed methods are suitable for handling different data tensor scenarios and outperform the state-of-the-art UFS methods.</p>

                  <p>Unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation aims to improve the segmentation accuracy of models on target domains without relying on labeled data from those domains.This approach is crucial when labeled target domain data is scarce or unavailable.It seeks to align the feature representations of the source domain (where labeled data is available) and the target domain (where only unlabeled data is present), thus enabling the model to generalize well to the target domain.Current image- and video-level domain adaptation have been addressed using different and specialized frameworks, training strategies and optimizations despite their underlying connections.In this paper, we propose a unified framework PiPa++, which leverages the core idea of ``comparing'' to (1) explicitly encourage learning of discriminative pixel-wise features with intraclass compactness and inter-class separability, (2) promote the robust feature learning of the identical patch against different contexts or fluctuations, and (3) enable the learning of temporal continuity under dynamic environments.With the designed task-smart contrastive sampling strategy, PiPa++ enables the mining of more informative training samples according to the task demand.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both image-level and video-level domain adaption benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with other UDA approaches to further improve the performance without introducing extra parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the field of deep learning-driven Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to be trained using only slide-level diagnostic labels.Previous MIL researches have primarily focused on enhancing feature aggregators for globally analyzing WSIs, but overlook a causal relationship in diagnosis: model's prediction should ideally stem solely from regions of the image that contain diagnostic evidence (such as tumor cells), which usually occupy relatively small areas.To address this limitation and establish the truly causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostic evidence regions, we propose Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL).CI-MIL integrates feature distillation with a novel patch decorrelation mechanism, employing a two-stage causal inference approach to distill and process patches with high diagnostic value.Initially, CI-MIL leverages feature distillation to identify patches likely containing tumor cells and extracts their corresponding feature representations.These features are then mapped to random Fourier feature space, where a learnable weighting scheme is employed to minimize inter-feature correlations, effectively reducing redundancy from homogenous patches and mitigating data bias.These processes strengthen the causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostically relevant regions, making the prediction more direct and reliable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p>

                  <p>This is the first work to investigate the effectiveness of BERT-based contextual embeddings in active learning (AL) tasks on cold-start scenarios, where traditional fine-tuning is infeasible due to the absence of labeled data.Our primary contribution is the proposal of a more robust fine-tuning pipeline - DoTCAL - that diminishes the reliance on labeled data in AL using two steps: (1) fully leveraging unlabeled data through domain adaptation of the embeddings via masked language modeling and (2) further adjusting model weights using labeled data selected by AL.Our evaluation contrasts BERT-based embeddings with other prevalent text representation paradigms, including Bag of Words (BoW), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and FastText, at two critical stages of the AL process: instance selection and classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments conducted on eight ATC benchmarks with varying AL budgets (number of labeled instances) and number of instances (about 5,000 to 300,000) demonstrate DoTCAL's superior effectiveness, achieving up to a 33% improvement in Macro-F1 while reducing labeling efforts by half compared to the traditional one-step method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We also found that in several tasks, BoW and LSI (due to information aggregation) produce results superior (up to 59% ) to BERT, especially in low-budget scenarios and hard-to-classify tasks, which is quite surprising.</p>

                  <p>In traditional Federated Learning approaches like FedAvg, the global model underperforms when faced with data heterogeneity.Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to train personalized models to fit their local data distribution better.However, we surprisingly find that the feature extractor in FedAvg is superior to those in most PFL methods.More interestingly, by applying a linear transformation on local features extracted by the feature extractor to align with the classifier, FedAvg can surpass the majority of PFL methods.This suggests that the primary cause of FedAvg's inadequate performance stems from the mismatch between the locally extracted features and the classifier.While current PFL methods mitigate this issue to some extent, their designs compromise the quality of the feature extractor, thus limiting the full potential of PFL.In this paper, we propose a new PFL framework called FedPFT to address the mismatch problem while enhancing the quality of the feature extractor.FedPFT integrates a feature transformation module, driven by personalized prompts, between the global feature extractor and classifier.In each round, clients first train prompts to transform local features to match the global classifier, followed by training model parameters.This approach can also align the training objectives of clients, reducing the impact of data heterogeneity on model collaboration.Moreover, FedPFT's feature transformation module is highly scalable, allowing for the use of different prompts to tailor local features to various tasks.Leveraging this, we introduce a collaborative contrastive learning task to further refine feature extractor quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate that FedPFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 7.08%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Web caches play a crucial role in web performance and scalability.However, detecting cached responses is challenging when web servers do not reliably communicate the cache status through standardized headers.This paper presents a novel methodology for cache detection using timing analysis.Our approach eliminates the dependency on cache status headers, making it applicable to any web server.The methodology relies on sending paired requests using HTTP multiplexing functionality and makes heavy use of cache-busting to control the origin of the responses.By measuring the time it takes to receive responses from paired requests, we can determine if a response is cached or not.In each pair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server, while the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present.A faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the cache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>Leveraging our cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the Tranco Top 50k websites.We identified a significant presence of hidden caches (5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers.Additionally, we employed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in these hidden caches.We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD vulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data.Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and highlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated cache status headers.</p>

                  <p>Different from traditional video retrieval, sign language retrieval is more biased towards understanding the semantic information of human actions contained in video clips.Previous works typically only encode RGB videos to obtain high-level semantic features, resulting in local action details drowned in a large amount of visual information redundancy.Furthermore, existing RGB-based sign retrieval works suffer from the huge memory cost of dense visual data embedding in end-to-end training, and adopt offline RGB encoder instead, leading to suboptimal feature representation.To address these issues, we propose a novel sign language representation framework called Semantically Enhanced Dual-Stream Encoder (SEDS), which integrates Pose and RGB modalities to represent the local and global information of sign language videos.Specifically, the Pose encoder embeds the coordinates of keypoints corresponding to human joints, effectively capturing detailed action features.For better context-aware fusion of two video modalities, we propose a Cross Gloss Attention Fusion (CGAF) module to aggregate the adjacent clip features with similar semantic information from intra-modality and inter-modality.Moreover, a Pose-RGB Fine-grained Matching Objective is developed to enhance the aggregated fusion feature by contextual matching of fine-grained dual-stream features.Besides the offline RGB encoder, the whole framework only contains learnable lightweight networks, which can be trained end-to-end.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

                  <p>On the GPU, hash table operation speed is determined in large part by cache line efficiency, and state-of-the-art hashing schemes thus divide tables into cache line-sized buckets.This raises the question whether performance can be further improved by increasing the number of entries that fit in such buckets.Known compact hashing techniques have not yet been adapted to the massively parallel setting, nor have they been evaluated on the GPU.We consider a compact version of bucketed cuckoo hashing, and a version of compact iceberg hashing suitable for the GPU.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss the tables from a theoretical perspective, and provide an open source implementation of both schemes in CUDA for comparative benchmarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>In terms of performance, the state-of-the-art cuckoo hashing benefits from compactness on lookups and insertions (most experiments show at least 10-20% increase in throughput), and the iceberg table benefits significantly, to the point of being comparable to compact cuckoo hashing--while supporting performant dynamic operation.</p>

                  <p>While imitation learning requires access to high-quality data, offline reinforcement learning (RL) should, in principle, perform similarly or better with substantially lower data quality by using a value function.However, current results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation learning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline RL.Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in current offline RL algorithms.While poor performance of offline RL is typically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: is the main bottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something else?To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1) value learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline RL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance.We make two surprising observations.First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction algorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL, often more so than the value learning objective.For instance, we show that common value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully leverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained policy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial improvements in performance and scalability.Second, we find that a big barrier to improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on test-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy learning on in-distribution states.We then show that the use of suboptimal but high-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this generalization issue in practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we propose two simple test-time policy improvement methods and show that these methods lead to better performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the field of deep learning-driven Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to be trained using only slide-level diagnostic labels.Previous MIL researches have primarily focused on enhancing feature aggregators for globally analyzing WSIs, but overlook a causal relationship in diagnosis: model's prediction should ideally stem solely from regions of the image that contain diagnostic evidence (such as tumor cells), which usually occupy relatively small areas.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation and establish the truly causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostic evidence regions, we propose Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>CI-MIL integrates feature distillation with a novel patch decorrelation mechanism, employing a two-stage causal inference approach to distill and process patches with high diagnostic value.Initially, CI-MIL leverages feature distillation to identify patches likely containing tumor cells and extracts their corresponding feature representations.These features are then mapped to random Fourier feature space, where a learnable weighting scheme is employed to minimize inter-feature correlations, effectively reducing redundancy from homogenous patches and mitigating data bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These processes strengthen the causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostically relevant regions, making the prediction more direct and reliable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p>

We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families.These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size.We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set.The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering.   We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets.It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes.Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets.For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges.We show an example of how the output of RTRExtractor correlates with meaningful sets of similar vertices in a citation network, demonstrating the utility of RTRExtractor for unsupervised graph discovery tasks.</p>

                  <p>One of the predominant methods for training world models is autoregressive prediction in the output space of the next element of a sequence.In Natural Language Processing (NLP), this takes the form of Large Language Models (LLMs) predicting the next token; in Computer Vision (CV), this takes the form of autoregressive models predicting the next frame/token/pixel.However, this approach differs from human cognition in several respects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, human predictions about the future actively influence internal cognitive processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>Second, humans naturally evaluate the plausibility of predictions regarding future states.Based on this capability, and third, by assessing when predictions are sufficient, humans allocate a dynamic amount of time to make a prediction.This adaptive process is analogous to System 2 thinking in psychology.All these capabilities are fundamental to the success of humans at high-level reasoning and planning.Therefore, to address the limitations of traditional autoregressive models lacking these human-like capabilities, we introduce Energy-Based World Models (EBWM).EBWM involves training an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to predict the compatibility of a given context and a predicted future state.In doing so, EBWM enables models to achieve all three facets of human cognition described.Moreover, we developed a variant of the traditional autoregressive transformer tailored for Energy-Based models, termed the Energy-Based Transformer (EBT).Our results demonstrate that EBWM scales better with data and GPU Hours than traditional autoregressive transformers in CV, and that EBWM offers promising early scaling in NLP.Consequently, this approach offers an exciting path toward training future models capable of System 2 thinking and intelligently searching across state spaces.</p>

                  <p>Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios.Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions.In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning.We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF.   To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning.FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables.Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF.We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.</p>

                  <p>Colloquially speaking, image generation models based upon diffusion processes are frequently said to exhibit "hallucinations," samples that could never occur in the training data.But where do such hallucinations come from?In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation.Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly "interpolate" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations.Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed.Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate.This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process.Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples.We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset.We release our code at https://github.com/locuslab/diffusion-model-hallucination.</p>

                  <p>Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change.Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations.These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections.Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard.However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation.We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training.First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered.Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features.We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.</p>

                A More Practical Approach to Machine Unlearning

                  <p>Machine learning models often incorporate vast amounts of data, raising significant privacy concerns.Machine unlearning, the ability to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, addresses these concerns.This paper explores practical methods for implementing machine unlearning, focusing on a first-epoch gradient-ascent approach.   Key findings include: 1.Single vs. Multi-Epoch Unlearning: First-epoch gradient unlearning is more effective than multi-epoch gradients.2. Layer-Based Unlearning: The embedding layer in GPT-2 is crucial for effective unlearning.Gradients from the output layers (11 and 12) have no impact.Efficient unlearning can be achieved using only the embedding layer, halving space complexity.3. Influence Functions & Scoring: Techniques like Hessian Vector Product and the dot product of activations and tensors are used for quantifying unlearning.4. Gradient Ascent Considerations: Calibration is necessary to avoid overexposing the model to specific data points during unlearning, which could prematurely terminate the process.5.Fuzzy Matching vs. IterativeUnlearning:Fuzzy matching techniques shift the model to a new optimum, while iterative unlearning provides a more complete modality.   Our empirical evaluation confirms that first-epoch gradient ascent for machine unlearning is more effective than whole-model gradient ascent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the potential of machine unlearning for enhancing data privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>The study underscores the importance of formal methods to comprehensively evaluate the unlearning process.</p>

                  <p>We propose to build omni-modal intelligence, which is capable of understanding any modality and learning universal representations.In specific, we propose a scalable pretraining paradigm, named Multimodal Context (MiCo), which can scale up the numbers of modalities and amount of data, together with the model parameters, in the pretraining process.With MiCo, the pretrained models show significant emergent abilities in multimodal learning, which are evaluated on the following tasks: i) single-modality perception benchmarks of 10 different modalities, ii) 25 cross-modality understanding tasks of retrieval, question-answering, captioning, and iii) 18 multimodal large language model benchmarks.Our models establish 37 new records for state-of-the-art performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope that our research could contribute to the development of omni-modal intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Code and Models are at https://github.com/invictus717/MiCo</p>
