                  <p>Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a core task in the field of AI-assisted disability.Unlike traditional SLT based on visible light videos, which is easily affected by factors such as lighting, rapid hand movements, and privacy breaches, this paper proposes the use of high-definition Event streams for SLT, effectively mitigating the aforementioned issues.This is primarily because Event streams have a high dynamic range and dense temporal signals, which can withstand low illumination and motion blur well.Additionally, due to their sparsity in space, they effectively protect the privacy of the target person.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More specifically, we propose a new high-resolution Event stream sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively fills the data gap in this area of research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It contains 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>These samples are collected in a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes, encompassing multiple angles, light intensities, and camera movements.We have benchmarked existing mainstream SLT works to enable fair comparison for future efforts.Based on this dataset and several other large-scale datasets, we propose a novel baseline method that fully leverages the Mamba model's ability to integrate temporal information of CNN features, resulting in improved sign language translation outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks.However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances.Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs.In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM.We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts.Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Background: Breast ultrasound is prominently used in diagnosing breast tumors.At present, many automatic systems based on deep learning have been developed to help radiologists in diagnosis.However, training such systems remains challenging because they are usually data-hungry and demand amounts of labeled data, which need professional knowledge and are expensive.Methods: We adopted a triplet network and a self-supervised contrastive learning technique to learn representations from unlabeled breast ultrasound video clips.We further designed a new hard triplet loss to to learn representations that particularly discriminate positive and negative image pairs that are hard to recognize.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also constructed a pretraining dataset from breast ultrasound videos (1,360 videos from 200 patients), which includes an anchor sample dataset with 11,805 images, a positive sample dataset with 188,880 images, and a negative sample dataset dynamically generated from video clips. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we constructed a finetuning dataset, including 400 images from 66 patients. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span>We transferred the pretrained network to a downstream benign/malignant classification task and compared the performance with other state-of-the-art models, including three models pretrained on ImageNet and a previous contrastive learning model retrained on our datasets.Results and conclusion: Experiments revealed that our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.952, which is significantly higher than the others.Further, we assessed the dependence of our pretrained model on the number of labeled data and revealed that <100 samples were required to achieve an AUC of 0.901.The proposed framework greatly reduces the demand for labeled data and holds potential for use in automatic breast ultrasound image diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>Synthetic data is increasingly being used to address the lack of labeled images in uncommon domains for deep learning tasks.A prominent example is 2D pose estimation of animals, particularly wild species like zebras, for which collecting real-world data is complex and impractical.However, many approaches still require real images, consistency and style constraints, sophisticated animal models, and/or powerful pre-trained networks to bridge the syn-to-real gap.Moreover, they often assume that the animal can be reliably detected in images or videos, a hypothesis that often does not hold, e.g. in wildlife scenarios or aerial images.To solve this, we use synthetic data generated with a 3D photorealistic simulator to obtain the first synthetic dataset that can be used for both detection and 2D pose estimation of zebras without applying any of the aforementioned bridging strategies.Unlike previous works, we extensively train and benchmark our detection and 2D pose estimation models on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets using both pre-trained and non-pre-trained backbones.These experiments show how the models trained from scratch and only with synthetic data can consistently generalize to real-world images of zebras in both tasks.Moreover, we show it is possible to easily generalize those same models to 2D pose estimation of horses with a minimal amount of real-world images to account for the domain transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, results, trained models; and the synthetic, training, and validation data, including 104K manually labeled frames, are provided as open-source at https://zebrapose.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

We selected ResNet50, VIT-B/16, CLIP, and FLIP as representative models and benchmarked them on the IrisGeneral dataset.Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMoE with CLIP achieves the best performance on IrisGeneral.</p>

                  <p>From SAE Level 3 of automation onwards, drivers are allowed to engage in activities that are not directly related to driving during their travel.However, in level 3, a misunderstanding of the capabilities of the system might lead drivers to engage in secondary tasks, which could impair their ability to react to challenging traffic situations.   Anticipating driver activity allows for early detection of risky behaviors, to prevent accidents.To be able to predict the driver activity, a Deep Learning network needs to be trained on a dataset.However, the use of datasets based on simulation for training and the migration to real-world data for prediction has proven to be suboptimal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hence, this paper presents a real-world driver activity dataset, openly accessible on IEEE Dataport, which encompasses various activities that occur in autonomous driving scenarios under various illumination and weather conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>Results from the training process showed that the dataset provides an excellent benchmark for implementing models for driver activity recognition.</p>

                  <p>Symmetric second-order tensors are fundamental in various scientific and engineering domains, as they can represent properties such as material stresses or diffusion processes in brain tissue.In recent years, several approaches have been introduced and improved to analyze these fields using topological features, such as degenerate tensor locations, i.e., the tensor has repeated eigenvalues, or normal surfaces.Traditionally, the identification of such features has been limited to single tensor fields.However, it has become common to create ensembles to account for uncertainties and variability in simulations and measurements.In this work, we explore novel methods for describing and visualizing degenerate tensor locations in 3D symmetric second-order tensor field ensembles.We base our considerations on the tensor mode and analyze its practicality in characterizing the uncertainty of degenerate tensor locations before proposing a variety of visualization strategies to effectively communicate degenerate tensor information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our techniques for synthetic and simulation data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>The results indicate that the interplay of different descriptions for uncertainty can effectively convey information on degenerate tensor locations.</p>

                  <p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses.Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings.Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD.This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints.We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span>Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting.Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians.Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP.This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels.Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive.This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports.

                  <p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are engineered to be robust in contextual understanding and exhibit outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks.However, their considerable size incurs significant computational and storage costs.Modern pruning strategies employ one-shot techniques to compress PLMs without the need for retraining on task-specific or otherwise general data; however, these approaches often lead to an indispensable reduction in performance.In this paper, we propose SDS, a Sparse-Dense-Sparse pruning framework to enhance the performance of the pruned PLMs from a weight distribution optimization perspective.We outline the pruning process in three steps.Initially, we prune less critical connections in the model using conventional one-shot pruning methods.Next, we reconstruct a dense model featuring a pruning-friendly weight distribution by reactivating pruned connections with sparse regularization.Finally, we perform a second pruning round, yielding a superior pruned model compared to the initial pruning.Experimental results demonstrate that SDS outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning techniques SparseGPT and Wanda under an identical sparsity configuration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, SDS reduces perplexity by 9.13 on Raw-Wikitext2 and improves accuracy by an average of 2.05% across multiple zero-shot benchmarks for OPT-125M with 2:4 sparsity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Novelty detection is a critical task for deploying machine learning models in the open world.A crucial property of novelty detection methods is universality, which can be interpreted as generalization across various distributions of training or test data.More precisely, for novelty detection, distribution shifts may occur in the training set or the test set.Shifts in the training set refer to cases where we train a novelty detector on a new dataset and expect strong transferability.Conversely, distribution shifts in the test set indicate the methods' performance when the trained model encounters a shifted test sample.We experimentally show that existing methods falter in maintaining universality, which stems from their rigid inductive biases.Motivated by this, we aim for more generalized techniques that have more adaptable inductive biases.In this context, we leverage the fact that contrastive learning provides an efficient framework to easily switch and adapt to new inductive biases through the proper choice of augmentations in forming the negative pairs.We propose a novel probabilistic auto-negative pair generation method AutoAugOOD, along with contrastive learning, to yield a universal novelty detector method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method under different distribution shifts in various image benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Notably, our method emerges universality in the lens of adaptability to different setups of novelty detection, including one-class, unlabeled multi-class, and labeled multi-class settings.Code: https://github.com/mojtaba-nafez/UNODE</p>

                  <p>A neural network architecture is presented that exploits the multilevel properties of high-dimensional parameter-dependent partial differential equations, enabling an efficient approximation of parameter-to-solution maps, rivaling best-in-class methods such as low-rank tensor regression in terms of accuracy and complexity.The neural network is trained with data on adaptively refined finite element meshes, thus reducing data complexity significantly.Error control is achieved by using a reliable finite element a posteriori error estimator, which is also provided as input to the neural network.   The proposed U-Net architecture with CNN layers mimics a classical finite element multigrid algorithm.It can be shown that the CNN efficiently approximates all operations required by the solver, including the evaluation of the residual-based error estimator.In the CNN, a culling mask set-up according to the local corrections due to refinement on each mesh level reduces the overall complexity, allowing the network optimization with localized fine-scale finite element data.   A complete convergence and complexity analysis is carried out for the adaptive multilevel scheme, which differs in several aspects from previous non-adaptive multilevel CNN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, numerical experiments with common benchmark problems from Uncertainty Quantification illustrate the practical performance of the architecture. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying the point of error is imperative in software debugging.Traditional fault localization (FL) techniques rely on executing the program and using the code coverage matrix in tandem with test case results to calculate a suspiciousness score for each function or line.Recently, learning-based FL techniques have harnessed machine learning models to extract meaningful features from the code coverage matrix and improve FL performance.These techniques, however, require compilable source code, existing test cases, and specialized tools for generating the code coverage matrix for each programming language of interest.   In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the privacy funnel, a privacy-utility tradeoff problem in which mutual information quantifies both privacy and utility.The objective is to maximize utility while adhering to a specified privacy budget.However, the privacy funnel represents a non-convex optimization problem, making it challenging to achieve an optimal solution.An existing proposed approach to this problem involves substituting the mutual information with the lift (the exponent of information density) and then solving the optimization.Since mutual information is the expectation of the information density, this substitution overestimates the privacy loss and results in a final smaller bound on the privacy of mutual information than what is allowed in the budget.This significantly compromises the utility.To overcome this limitation, we propose using a privacy measure that is more relaxed than the lift but stricter than mutual information while still allowing the optimization to be efficiently solved.Instead of directly using information density, our proposed measure is the average of information density over the sensitive data distribution for each observed data realization.We then introduce a heuristic algorithm capable of achieving solutions that produce extreme privacy values, which enhances utility.The numerical results confirm improved utility at the same privacy budget compared to existing solutions in the literature.Additionally, we explore two other privacy measures, $\ell_{1}$-norm and strong $\chi^2$-divergence, demonstrating the applicability of our algorithm to these lift-based measures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing its output with previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Finally, we validate our heuristic approach with a theoretical framework that estimates the optimal utility for strong $\chi^2$-divergence, numerically showing a perfect match.</p>

                  <p>In light of the inherent entailment relations between images and text, hyperbolic point vector embeddings, leveraging the hierarchical modeling advantages of hyperbolic space, have been utilized for visual semantic representation learning.However, point vector embedding approaches fail to address the issue of semantic uncertainty, where an image may have multiple interpretations, and text may refer to different images, a phenomenon particularly prevalent in the medical domain.Therefor, we propose \textbf{HYDEN}, a novel hyperbolic density embedding based image-text representation learning approach tailored for specific medical domain data.This method integrates text-aware local features alongside global features from images, mapping image-text features to density features in hyperbolic space via using hyperbolic pseudo-Gaussian distributions.An encapsulation loss function is employed to model the partial order relations between image-text density distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the interpretability of our approach and its superior performance compared to the baseline methods across various zero-shot tasks and different datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is one of the indispensable tasks in human-centered research.However, existing datasets neglect different domains (e.g., environments, times, populations, and data sources), only conducting simple random splits, and the performance of these datasets has already approached saturation.In the past five years, no large-scale dataset has been opened to the public.To address this issue, this paper proposes a new large-scale, cross-domain pedestrian attribute recognition dataset to fill the data gap, termed MSP60K.It consists of 60,122 images and 57 attribute annotations across eight scenarios.Synthetic degradation is also conducted to further narrow the gap between the dataset and real-world challenging scenarios.To establish a more rigorous benchmark, we evaluate 17 representative PAR models under both random and cross-domain split protocols on our dataset.Additionally, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) augmented PAR framework, named LLM-PAR.This framework processes pedestrian images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract features and introduces a multi-embedding query Transformer to learn partial-aware features for attribute classification.Significantly, we enhance this framework with LLM for ensemble learning and visual feature augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly validated the efficacy of our proposed framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>The dataset and source code accompanying this paper will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR}.</p>

To address these issues, we introduce the Generative Compatibility Model (GeCo), a two-stage approach that improves fashion image retrieval through paired image-to-image translation.First, the Complementary Item Generation Model (CIGM), built on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generates target item images (e.g., bottoms) from seed items (e.g., tops), offering conditioning signals for retrieval.These generated samples are then integrated into GeCo, enhancing compatibility modeling and retrieval accuracy.Evaluations on three datasets show that GeCo outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.Key contributions include: (i) the GeCo model utilizing paired image-to-image translation within the Composed Image Retrieval framework, (ii) comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, and (iii) the release of a new Fashion Taobao dataset designed for top-bottom retrieval, promoting further research.</p>

                  <p>In this paper we show how fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can be accelerated using a systolic architecture.We begin by analyzing FHE algorithms and then develop systolic or systolic-esque units for each major kernel.Connecting units is challenging due to the different data access and computational patterns of the kernels.We overcome this by proposing a new data tiling technique that we name limb interleaving.Limb interleaving creates a common data input/output pattern across all kernels that allows the entire architecture, named Osiris, to operate in lockstep.Osiris is capable of processing key-switches, bootstrapping, and full neural network inferences with high utilization across a range of FHE parameters.To achieve high performance, we propose a new giant-step centric (GSC) dataflow that efficiently maps state-of-the-art FHE matrix-vector product algorithms onto Osiris by optimizing for reuse and parallelism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation of Osiris shows it outperforms the prior state-of-the-art accelerator on all standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training.We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data.LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs?Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content.Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content.This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment.To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content.We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs.We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better.Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability.Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs.Such data are then used to finetune an LLM.We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level.Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates factors related to the acceptance of trust registers (e.g., the Chinese Social Credit System - SCS) in Western settings.To avoid a negative connotation, we first define the concept of trust register which encompasses surveillance systems in other settings beyond China, such as FICO in the US.Then, we explore which factors are associated with people's attitude towards trust registers leaning on the technology acceptance and privacy concern theories.A cross-sectional survey among Slovenian Facebook and Instagram users (N=147) was conducted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used to test the hypothesized associations between the studied constructs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.557</span></span>Results indicate that attitude towards trust register is directly associated with perceived general usefulness of the trust register.Additionally, perceived general usefulness is associated with perceived usefulness of the trust register for ensuring national security and fighting crime, its ease of use, and privacy concern regarding data collection.As one of the first studies investigating attitude towards trust registers in a Western country, it provides pioneering insights into factors that may be relevant in case such registers would be implemented in a Western context, and provides some practical implications regarding messaging for would-be implementers of such systems.</p>

                  <p>Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks.However, most surrogate models characterising physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, and needing further validation.Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs.The paper provides an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation.The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, ranging from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting.Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models.The paper concludes with a viable conformal prediction formalisation that provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</p>

                  <p>Code Technical Debt prediction has become a popular research niche in recent software engineering literature.Technical Debt is an important metric in software projects as it measures professionals' effort to clean the code.Therefore, predicting its future behavior becomes a crucial task.However, no well-defined and consistent approach can completely capture the features that impact the evolution of Code Technical Debt.The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of considering time-dependent techniques as well as seasonal effects in temporal data in the prediction performance within the context of Code Technical Debt.The study adopts existing, yet not extensively adopted, time-dependent prediction techniques and compares their prediction performance to commonly used Machine Learning models.Further, the study strengthens the evaluation of time-dependent methods by extending the analysis to capture the impact of seasonality in Code Technical Debt data.We trained 11 prediction models using the commit history of 31 open-source projects developed with Java.We predicted the future observations of the SQALE index to evaluate their predictive performance.Our study confirms the positive impact of considering time-dependent techniques.The adopted multivariate time series analysis model ARIMAX overcame the rest of the adopted models.Incorporating seasonal effects led to an enhancement in the predictive performance of the adopted time-dependent techniques.However, the impact of this effect was found to be relatively modest.The findings of this study corroborate our position in favor of implementing techniques that capture the existing time dependence within historical data of software metrics, specifically in the context of this study, namely, Code Technical Debt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This necessitates the utilization of techniques that can effectively address this evidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning electronic health records (EHRs) has received emerging attention because of its capability to facilitate accurate medical diagnosis.Since the EHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions between entities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice.The EHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, and complexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them.Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning the representations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHR analysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across different tasks.In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHR modeling, namely MulT-EHR (Multi-Task EHR), which leverages a heterogeneous graph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based on the causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects and reduce noise in the EHR data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Additionally, since our model adopts a single graph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design a multi-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularize the training process.Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks -- drug recommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, and readmission.Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of our method upon variations to key components and hyperparameters.</p>

Consequently, deploying such deep architectures faces challenges in environments with processing and runtime constraints, particularly in embedded systems.This paper covers the main model compression techniques applied for computer vision tasks, enabling modern models to be used in embedded systems.We present the characteristics of compression subareas, compare different approaches, and discuss how to choose the best technique and expected variations when analyzing it on various embedded devices.We also share codes to assist researchers and new practitioners in overcoming initial implementation challenges for each subarea and present trends for Model Compression.Case studies for compression models are available at \href{https://github.com/venturusbr/cv-model-compression}{https://github.com/venturusbr/cv-model-compression}.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities.Their powerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on various queries or instructions.Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diverse tasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors.This paper proposes an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customized backdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects.In our approach, we first leverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics into the input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoor into an LLM.By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch of samples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves high robustness.Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategy achieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining the model's performance on clean data.Notably, the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfully completing downstream tasks.This suggests that future LLM applications could be guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM's generative style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe this approach provides insights for future LLM applications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AI systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation.However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement.Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI.Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images.In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training.Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge.By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures.Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span></p>

                  <p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection.These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image.However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image.By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing.Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization.We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context.Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework.We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web.Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our code and data publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span></p>

                Feasibility of assessing cognitive impairment via distributed camera network and privacy-preserving edge computing

                  <p>INTRODUCTION:Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by a decline in cognitive functions beyond typical age and education-related expectations.Since, MCI has been linked to reduced social interactions and increased aimless movements, we aimed to automate the capture of these behaviors to enhance longitudinal monitoring.   METHODS: Using a privacy-preserving distributed camera network, we collected movement and social interaction data from groups of individuals with MCI undergoing therapy within a 1700$m^2$ space.We developed movement and social interaction features, which were then used to train a series of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between higher and lower cognitive functioning MCI groups.   RESULTS:A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between high and low-functioning cohorts in features such as linear path length, walking speed, change in direction while walking, entropy of velocity and direction change, and number of group formations in the indoor space.Despite lacking individual identifiers to associate with specific levels of MCI, a machine learning approach using the most significant features provided a 71% accuracy.   DISCUSSION:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide evidence to show that a privacy-preserving low-cost camera network using edge computing framework has the potential to distinguish between different levels of cognitive impairment from the movements and social interactions captured during group activities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in abductive reasoning and holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored.This work introduces RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning ability of LLMs in interactive settings.In RULEARN, agents interact with the environment to gather observations and discern patterns, using these insights to solve problems.To further enhance the rule-learning capabilities of LLM agents within this benchmark, we propose IDEA agent, which integrates Induction, Deduction, and Abduction processes.IDEA agent refines this approach by leveraging a structured reasoning sequence: generating hypotheses through abduction, testing them via deduction, and refining them based on induction feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This sequence enables agents to dynamically establish and apply rules, mimicking human-like reasoning processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>Our evaluation of five representative LLMs indicates that while these models can generate plausible initial hypotheses, they often struggle with strategic interaction within the environment, effective incorporation of feedback, and adaptive refinement of their hypotheses.IDEA agent demonstrates significantly improved performance on the RULEARN benchmark, offering valuable insights for the development of agents capable of human-like rule-learning in real-world scenarios.We will release our code and data.</p>
