                  <p>In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method for image understanding tasks under Curriculum Learning (CL) paradigm which leverages RGB-D. The method utilizes Multi-Modal Contrastive Masked Autoencoder and Denoising techniques.Recent approaches either use masked autoencoding (e.g., MultiMAE) or contrastive learning(e.g., Pri3D, or combine them in a single contrastive masked autoencoder architecture such as CMAE and CAV-MAE.However, none of the single contrastive masked autoencoder is applicable to RGB-D datasets.To improve the performance and efficacy of such methods, we propose a new pre-training strategy based on CL.Specifically, in the first stage, we pre-train the model using contrastive learning to learn cross-modal representations.In the second stage, we initialize the modality-specific encoders using the weights from the first stage and then pre-train the model using masked autoencoding and denoising/noise prediction used in diffusion models.Masked autoencoding focuses on reconstructing the missing patches in the input modality using local spatial correlations, while denoising learns high frequency components of the input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is scalable, robust and suitable for pre-training with limited RGB-D datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as ScanNet, NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D show the efficacy and superior performance of our approach.Specifically, we show an improvement of +1.0% mIoU against Mask3D on ScanNet semantic segmentation.We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in low-data regime by evaluating it for semantic segmentation task against the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Unsupervised 3D keypoints estimation from Point Cloud Data (PCD) is a complex task, even more challenging when an object shape is deforming.As keypoints should be semantically and geometrically consistent across all the 3D frames - each keypoint should be anchored to a specific part of the deforming shape irrespective of intrinsic and extrinsic motion.This paper presents, "SelfGeo", a self-supervised method that computes persistent 3D keypoints of non-rigid objects from arbitrary PCDs without the need of human annotations.The gist of SelfGeo is to estimate keypoints between frames that respect invariant properties of deforming bodies.Our main contribution is to enforce that keypoints deform along with the shape while keeping constant geodesic distances among them.This principle is then propagated to the design of a set of losses which minimization let emerge repeatable keypoints in specific semantic locations of the non-rigid shape.We show experimentally that the use of geodesic has a clear advantage in challenging dynamic scenes and with different classes of deforming shapes (humans and animals).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/IIT-PAVIS/SelfGeo <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) involves several clients that share with a fusion center (FC), the model each client has trained with its own data.Conventional FL, which can be interpreted as an estimation or distortion-based approach, ignores the final use of model information (MI) by the FC and the other clients.In this paper, we introduce a novel FL framework in which the FC uses an aggregate version of the MI to make decisions that affect the client's utility functions.Clients cannot choose the decisions and can only use the MI reported to the FC to maximize their utility.Depending on the alignment between the client and FC utilities, the client may have an individual interest in adding strategic noise to the model.This general framework is stated and specialized to the case of clustering, in which noisy cluster representative information is reported.This is applied to the problem of power consumption scheduling.In this context, utility non-alignment occurs, for instance, when the client wants to consume when the price of electricity is low, whereas the FC wants the consumption to occur when the total power is the lowest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is illustrated with aggregated real data from Ausgrid \cite{ausgrid}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Our numerical analysis clearly shows that the client can increase his utility by adding noise to the model reported to the FC.Corresponding results and source codes can be downloaded from \cite{source-code}.</p>

Forensic tool innovations and ontology developments, such as the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE), have been proposed to assist DFI and LEA.Although these tools and ontologies are useful, they lack extensive information sharing and tool interoperability features, and the ontologies lack the latest Smart City Infrastructure (SCI) context that was proposed.   To mitigate the weaknesses in both solutions and to ensure a safer cyber-physical environment for all, we propose the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE), an expansion profile of the UCO and CASE ontology that implements SCI threat models, SCI digital forensic evidence, attack techniques, patterns and classifications from MITRE.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We showcase how SCOPE could present complex data such as SCI-specific threats, cybercrime, investigation data and incident handling workflows via an incident scenario modelled after publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>We also make SCOPE available to the community so that threats, digital evidence and cybercrime in emerging trends such as SCI can be identified, represented, and shared collaboratively.</p>

                  <p>Perception systems of autonomous vehicles are susceptible to occlusion, especially when examined from a vehicle-centric perspective.Such occlusion can lead to overlooked object detections, e.g., larger vehicles such as trucks or buses may create blind spots where cyclists or pedestrians could be obscured, accentuating the safety concerns associated with such perception system limitations.To mitigate these challenges, the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigm suggests employing an infrastructure-side perception system (IPS) to complement autonomous vehicles with a broader perceptual scope.Nevertheless, the scarcity of real-world 3D infrastructure-side datasets constrains the advancement of V2X technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces a new 3D infrastructure-side collaborative perception dataset, abbreviated as inscope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Notably, InScope is the first dataset dedicated to addressing occlusion challenges by strategically deploying multiple-position Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems on the infrastructure side.Specifically, InScope encapsulates a 20-day capture duration with 303 tracking trajectories and 187,787 3D bounding boxes annotated by experts.Through analysis of benchmarks, four different benchmarks are presented for open traffic scenarios, including collaborative 3D object detection, multisource data fusion, data domain transfer, and 3D multiobject tracking tasks.Additionally, a new metric is designed to quantify the impact of occlusion, facilitating the evaluation of detection degradation ratios among various algorithms.The Experimental findings showcase the enhanced performance of leveraging InScope to assist in detecting and tracking 3D multiobjects in real-world scenarios, particularly in tracking obscured, small, and distant objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/xf-zh/InScope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Abusive content in online social networks is a well-known problem that can cause serious psychological harm and incite hatred.The ability to upload audio data increases the importance of developing methods to detect abusive content in speech recordings.However, simply transferring the mechanisms from written abuse detection would ignore relevant information such as emotion and tone.In addition, many current algorithms require training in the specific language for which they are being used.This paper proposes to use acoustic and prosodic features to classify abusive content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used the ADIMA data set, which contains recordings from ten Indic languages, and trained different models in multilingual and cross-lingual settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Our results show that it is possible to classify abusive and non-abusive content using only acoustic and prosodic features.The most important and influential features are discussed.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the attention towards One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has been driven by its capacity to minimize communication.With the development of the diffusion model (DM), several methods employ the DM for OSFL, utilizing model parameters, image features, or textual prompts as mediums to transfer the local client knowledge to the server.However, these mediums often require public datasets or the uniform feature extractor, significantly limiting their practicality.In this paper, we propose FedDEO, a Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning Method with DMs, offering a novel exploration of utilizing the DM in OSFL.The core idea of our method involves training local descriptions on the clients, serving as the medium to transfer the knowledge of the distributed clients to the server.Firstly, we train local descriptions on the client data to capture the characteristics of client distributions, which are then uploaded to the server.On the server, the descriptions are used as conditions to guide the DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the distributions of various clients, enabling the training of the aggregated model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Theoretical analyses and sufficient quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that through the training of local descriptions, the server is capable of generating synthetic datasets with high quality and diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>Consequently, with advantages in communication and privacy protection, the aggregated model outperforms compared FL or diffusion-based OSFL methods and, on some clients, outperforms the performance ceiling of centralized training.</p>

                  <p>In object detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.However, UDA's reliance on labeled source data restricts its adaptability in privacy-related scenarios.This study focuses on source-free object detection (SFOD), which adapts a source-trained detector to an unlabeled target domain without using labeled source data.Recent advancements in self-training, particularly with the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, show promise for SFOD deployment.However, the absence of source supervision significantly compromises the stability of these approaches.We identify two primary issues, (1) uncontrollable degradation of the teacher model due to inopportune updates from the student model, and (2) the student model's tendency to replicate errors from incorrect pseudo labels, leading to it being trapped in a local optimum.Both factors contribute to a detrimental circular dependency, resulting in rapid performance degradation in recent self-training frameworks.To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dynamic Retraining-Updating (DRU) mechanism, which actively manages the student training and teacher updating processes to achieve co-evolutionary training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Historical Student Loss to mitigate the influence of incorrect pseudo labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SFOD setting on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks, comparable to or even surpassing advanced UDA methods.The code will be released at https://github.com/lbktrinh/DRU</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable advancements in various fields using large, well-annotated datasets.However, real-world data often exhibit long-tailed distributions and label noise, significantly degrading generalization performance.Recent studies addressing these issues have focused on noisy sample selection methods that estimate the centroid of each class based on high-confidence samples within each target class.The performance of these methods is limited because they use only the training samples within each class for class centroid estimation, making the quality of centroids susceptible to long-tailed distributions and noisy labels.In this study, we present a robust training framework called Distribution-aware Sample Selection and Contrastive Learning (DaSC).Specifically, DaSC introduces a Distribution-aware Class Centroid Estimation (DaCC) to generate enhanced class centroids.DaCC performs weighted averaging of the features from all samples, with weights determined based on model predictions.Additionally, we propose a confidence-aware contrastive learning strategy to obtain balanced and robust representations.The training samples are categorized into high-confidence and low-confidence samples.Our method then applies Semi-supervised Balanced Contrastive Loss (SBCL) using high-confidence samples, leveraging reliable label information to mitigate class bias.For the low-confidence samples, our method computes Mixup-enhanced Instance Discrimination Loss (MIDL) to improve their representations in a self-supervised manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results on CIFAR and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DaSC compared to previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>This work proposes a hierarchical clustering algorithm for high-dimensional datasets using the cyclic space of reversible finite cellular automata.In cellular automaton (CA) based clustering, if two objects belong to the same cycle, they are closely related and considered as part of the same cluster.However, if a high-dimensional dataset is clustered using the cycles of one CA, closely related objects may belong to different cycles.This paper identifies the relationship between objects in two different cycles based on the median of all elements in each cycle so that they can be grouped in the next stage.Further, to minimize the number of intermediate clusters which in turn reduces the computational cost, a rule selection strategy is taken to find the best rules based on information propagation and cycle structure.After encoding the dataset using frequency-based encoding such that the consecutive data elements maintain a minimum hamming distance in encoded form, our proposed clustering algorithm iterates over three stages to finally cluster the data elements into the desired number of clusters given by user.This algorithm can be applied to various fields, including healthcare, sports, chemical research, agriculture, etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When verified over standard benchmark datasets with various performance metrics, our algorithm is at par with the existing algorithms with quadratic time complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

                  <p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, which has no cure.Knee OA (KOA) is one of the highest causes of disability worldwide, and it costs billions of United States dollars to the global community.Prediction of KOA progression has been of high interest to the community for years, as it can advance treatment development through more efficient clinical trials and improve patient outcomes through more efficient healthcare utilization.Existing approaches for predicting KOA, however, are predominantly static, i.e. consider data from a single time point to predict progression many years into the future, and knee level, i.e. consider progression in a single joint only.Due to these and related reasons, these methods fail to deliver the level of predictive performance, which is sufficient to result in cost savings and better patient outcomes.Collecting extensive data from all patients on a regular basis could address the issue, but it is limited by the high cost at a population level.In this work, we propose to go beyond static prediction models in OA, and bring a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach, designed to dynamically follow up patients with the objective of maximizing the number of informative data acquisitions, while minimizing their total cost over a period of time.Our approach is based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and it leverages a novel reward function designed specifically for AS of disease progression in more than one part of a human body.Our method is end-to-end, relies on multi-modal Deep Learning, and requires no human input at inference time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Throughout an exhaustive experimental evaluation, we show that using RL can provide a higher monetary benefit when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span></p>

                  <p>Context: IoT systems, networks of connected devices powered by software, require studying software quality for maintenance.Despite extensive studies on non-IoT software quality, research on IoT software quality is lacking.It is uncertain if IoT and non-IoT systems software are comparable, hindering the confident application of results and best practices gained on non-IoT systems.   Objective:Therefore, we compare the code quality of two equivalent sets of IoT and non-IoT systems to determine whether there are similarities and differences.We also collect and revisit software-engineering best practices in non-IoT contexts to apply them to IoT.   Method: We design and apply a systematic method to select two sets of 94 non-IoT and IoT systems software from GitHub with comparable characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compute quality metrics on the systems in these two sets and then analyse and compare the metric values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We analyse in depth and provide specific examples of IoT system's complexity and how it manifests in the codebases.After the comparison, We systematically select and present a list of best practices to address the observed difference between IoT and non-IoT code.   Results: Through a comparison of metrics, we conclude that software for IoT systems is more complex, coupled, larger, less maintainable, and cohesive than non-IoT systems.Several factors, such as integrating multiple hardware and software components and managing data communication between them, contribute to these differences.Considering these differences, we present a revisited best practices list with approaches, tools, or techniques for developing IoT systems.As example, applying modularity, and refactoring are best practices for lowering the complexity.   Conclusion: Based on our work, researchers can now make an informed decision using existing studies on the quality of non-IoT systems for IoT systems.</p>

                  <p>Wearable systems provide continuous health monitoring and can lead to early detection of potential health issues.However, the lifecycle of wearable systems faces several challenges.First, effective model training for new wearable devices requires substantial labeled data from various subjects collected directly by the wearable.Second, subsequent model updates require further extensive labeled data for retraining.Finally, frequent model updating on the wearable device can decrease the battery life in long-term data monitoring.Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we propose MetaWearS, a meta-learning method to reduce the amount of initial data collection required.Moreover, our approach incorporates a prototypical updating mechanism, simplifying the update process by modifying the class prototype rather than retraining the entire model.We explore the performance of MetaWearS in two case studies, namely, the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of atrial fibrillation.We show that by fine-tuning with just a few samples, we achieve 70% and 82% AUC for the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of atrial fibrillation, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a conventional approach, our proposed method performs better with up to 45% AUC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Furthermore, updating the model with only 16 minutes of additional labeled data increases the AUC by up to 5.3%.Finally, MetaWearS reduces the energy consumption for model updates by 456x and 418x for epileptic seizure and AF detection, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a subclass of neuromorphic models that have great potential to be used as controllers in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) due to their energy efficiency.They can benefit from the prevalent approach of first training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and then translating to an SNN with subsequent hyperparameter tuning.The tuning is required to ensure that the resulting SNN is accurate with respect to the ANN in terms of metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).However, SNN controllers for safety-critical CPSs must also satisfy safety specifications, which are not guaranteed by the conversion approach.In this paper, we propose a solution which tunes the $temporal$ $window$ hyperparameter of the translated SNN to ensure both accuracy and compliance with the safe range specification that requires the SNN outputs to remain within a safe range.The core verification problem is modelled using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and is solved with Gurobi.When the controller fails to meet the range specification, we compute tight bounds on the SNN outputs as feedback for the CPS developer.To mitigate the high computational cost of verification, we integrate data-driven steps to minimize verification calls.Our approach provides designers with the confidence to safely integrate energy-efficient SNN controllers into modern CPSs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach with experimental results on five different benchmark neural controllers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the domain of black-box model extraction, conventional methods reliant on soft labels or surrogate datasets struggle with scaling to high-dimensional input spaces and managing the complexity of an extensive array of interrelated classes.In this work, we present a novel approach that utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to enhance synthetic data generation.SHAP quantifies the individual contributions of each input feature towards the victim model's output, facilitating the optimization of an energy-based GAN towards a desirable output.This method significantly boosts performance, achieving a 16.45% increase in the accuracy of image classification models and extending to video classification models with an average improvement of 26.11% and a maximum of 33.36% on challenging datasets such as UCF11, UCF101, Kinetics 400, Kinetics 600, and Something-Something V2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further demonstrate the effectiveness and practical utility of our method under various scenarios, including the availability of top-k prediction probabilities, top-k prediction labels, and top-1 labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is immensely important in extensive applications, such as electricity transformation, financial trade, medical monitoring, and smart agriculture.Although Transformer-based methods can handle time series data, their ability to predict long-term time series is limited due to the ``anti-order" nature of the self-attention mechanism.To address this problem, we focus on frequency domain to weaken the impact of order in TSF and propose the FreqBlock, where we first obtain frequency representations through the Frequency Transform Module.Subsequently, a newly designed Frequency Cross Attention is used to obtian enhanced frequency representations between the real and imaginary parts, thus establishing a link between the attention mechanism and the inherent Kramer-Kronig relations (KKRs).Our backbone network, FreqTSF, adopts a residual structure by concatenating multiple FreqBlocks to simulate KKRs in the frequency domain and avoid degradation problems.On a theoretical level, we demonstrate that the proposed two modules can significantly reduce the time and memory complexity from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for each FreqBlock computation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical studies on four benchmark datasets show that FreqTSF achieves an overall relative MSE reduction of 15\% and an overall relative MAE reduction of 11\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>The code will be available soon.</p>

                  <p>Track finding in particle data is a challenging pattern recognition problem in High Energy Physics.It takes as inputs a point cloud of space points and labels them so that space points created by the same particle have the same label.The list of space points with the same label is a track candidate.We argue that this pattern recognition problem can be formulated as a sorting problem, of which the inputs are a list of space points sorted by their distances away from the collision points and the outputs are the space points sorted by their labels.In this paper, we propose the TrackSorter algorithm: a Transformer-based algorithm for pattern recognition in particle data.TrackSorter uses a simple tokenization scheme to convert space points into discrete tokens.It then uses the tokenized space points as inputs and sorts the input tokens into track candidates.TrackSorter is a novel end-to-end track finding algorithm that leverages Transformer-based models to solve pattern recognition problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is evaluated on the TrackML dataset and has good track finding performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mix-up is a key technique for consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, generating strong-perturbed samples for strong-weak pseudo-supervision.Existing mix-up operations are performed either randomly or with predefined rules, such as replacing low-confidence patches with high-confidence ones.The former lacks control over the perturbation degree, leading to overfitting on randomly perturbed samples, while the latter tends to generate images with trivial perturbations, both of which limit the effectiveness of consistency learning.This paper aims to answer the following question: How can image mix-up perturbation be adaptively performed during training?To this end, we propose an Adaptive Mix algorithm (AdaMix) for image mix-up in a self-paced learning manner.Given that, in general, a model's performance gradually improves during training, AdaMix is equipped with a self-paced curriculum that, in the initial training stage, provides relatively simple perturbed samples and then gradually increases the difficulty of perturbed images by adaptively controlling the perturbation degree based on the model's learning state estimated by a self-paced regularize.We develop three frameworks with our AdaMix, i.e., AdaMix-ST, AdaMix-MT, and AdaMix-CT, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets, including both 2D and 3D modalities, show that the proposed frameworks are capable of achieving superior performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, compared with the state-of-the-art, AdaMix-CT achieves relative improvements of 2.62% in Dice and 48.25% in average surface distance on the ACDC dataset with 10% labeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>The results demonstrate that mix-up operations with dynamically adjusted perturbation strength based on the segmentation model's state can significantly enhance the effectiveness of consistency regularization.</p>

                  <p>Fredman proposed in 1976 the following algorithmic problem: Given are a ground set $X$, some partial order $P$ over $X$, and some comparison oracle $O_L$ that specifies a linear order $L$ over $X$ that extends $P$. A query to $O_L$ has as input distinct $x, x' \in X$ and outputs whether $x <_L x'$ or vice versa.If we denote by $e(P)$ the number of linear extensions of $P$, then $\log e(P)$ is a worst-case lower bound on the number of queries needed to output the sorted order of $X$.   Fredman did not specify in what form the partial order is given.Haeupler, Hlad\'ik, Iacono, Rozhon, Tarjan, and T\v{e}tek ('24) propose to assume as input a directed acyclic graph, $G$, with $m$ edges and $n=|X|$ vertices.Denote by $P_G$ the partial order induced by $G$. Algorithmic performance is measured in running time and the number of queries used, where they use $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries to output $X$ in its sorted order.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Their algorithm is worst-case optimal in terms of running time and queries, both. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Their algorithm combines topological sorting with heapsort, and uses sophisticated data structures (including a recent type of heap with a working-set bound).Their analysis relies upon sophisticated counting arguments using entropy, recursively defined sets defined over the run of their algorithm, and vertices in the graph that they identify as bottlenecks for sorting.   In this paper, we do away with sophistication.We show that when the input is a directed acyclic graph then the problem admits a simple solution using $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries.Especially our proofs are much simpler as we avoid the usage of advanced charging arguments and data structures, and instead rely upon two brief observations.</p>

                  <p>Recent approaches have shown that large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP can improve semantic segmentation performance.These methods typically aim for pixel-level vision-language alignment, but often rely on low resolution image features from CLIP, resulting in class ambiguities along boundaries.Moreover, the global scene representations in CLIP text embeddings do not directly correlate with the local and detailed pixel-level features, making meaningful alignment more difficult.To address these limitations, we introduce MTA-CLIP, a novel framework employing mask-level vision-language alignment.Specifically, we first propose Mask-Text Decoder that enhances the mask representations using rich textual data with the CLIP language model.Subsequently, it aligns mask representations with text embeddings using Mask-to-Text Contrastive Learning.Furthermore, we introduce MaskText Prompt Learning, utilizing multiple context-specific prompts for text embeddings to capture diverse class representations across masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, MTA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art, surpassing prior works by an average of 2.8% and 1.3% on on standard benchmark datasets, ADE20k and Cityscapes, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

                  <p>Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks.However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times.This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing.Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT).From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory.Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual learning (CL) is a fundamental topic in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model with continuously incoming data and tasks.Due to the memory limit, we cannot store all the historical data, and therefore confront the ``catastrophic forgetting'' problem, i.e., the performance on the previous tasks can substantially decrease because of the missing information in the latter period.Though a number of elegant methods have been proposed, the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon still cannot be well avoided in practice.In this paper, we study the problem from the gradient perspective, where our aim is to develop an effective algorithm to calibrate the gradient in each updating step of the model; namely, our goal is to guide the model to be updated in the right direction under the situation that a large amount of historical data are unavailable.Our idea is partly inspired by the seminal stochastic variance reduction methods (e.g., SVRG and SAGA) for reducing the variance of gradient estimation in stochastic gradient descent algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Another benefit is that our approach can be used as a general tool, which is able to be incorporated with several existing popular CL methods to achieve better performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also conduct a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span></p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table.Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization.However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs.In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification.Our method adaptively locates \textit{surprising tokens} of the input.A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is "certain but wrong", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time.By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data.The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>We also introduce a new benchmark Dolma-Book developed upon a novel framework, which employs book data collected both before and after model training to provide further evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Neurodegeneration as measured through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recognized as a potential biomarker for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), but is generally considered less specific than amyloid or tau based biomarkers.Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline.Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan.Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy.This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years.We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies).By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution.Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p>

                  <p>As learning-to-rank models are increasingly deployed for decision-making in areas with profound life implications, the FairML community has been developing fair learning-to-rank (LTR) models.These models rely on the availability of sensitive demographic features such as race or sex.However, in practice, regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns protect this data from collection and use.As a result, practitioners may either need to promote fairness despite the absence of these features or turn to demographic inference tools to attempt to infer them.Given that these tools are fallible, this paper aims to further understand how errors in demographic inference impact the fairness performance of popular fair LTR strategies.In which cases would it be better to keep such demographic attributes hidden from models versus infer them?We examine a spectrum of fair LTR strategies ranging from fair LTR with and without demographic features hidden versus inferred to fairness-unaware LTR followed by fair re-ranking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a controlled empirical investigation modeling different levels of inference errors by systematically perturbing the inferred sensitive attribute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>We also perform three case studies with real-world datasets and popular open-source inference methods.Our findings reveal that as inference noise grows, LTR-based methods that incorporate fairness considerations into the learning process may increase bias.In contrast, fair re-ranking strategies are more robust to inference errors.All source code, data, and experimental artifacts of our experimental study are available here: https://github.com/sewen007/hoiltr.git</p>

                  <p>Multi-task learning (MTL) is an inductive transfer mechanism designed to leverage useful information from multiple tasks to improve generalization performance compared to single-task learning.It has been extensively explored in traditional machine learning to address issues such as data sparsity and overfitting in neural networks.In this work, we apply MTL to problems in science and engineering governed by partial differential equations (PDEs).However, implementing MTL in this context is complex, as it requires task-specific modifications to accommodate various scenarios representing different physical processes.To this end, we present a multi-task deep operator network (MT-DeepONet) to learn solutions across various functional forms of source terms in a PDE and multiple geometries in a single concurrent training session.We introduce modifications in the branch network of the vanilla DeepONet to account for various functional forms of a parameterized coefficient in a PDE.Additionally, we handle parameterized geometries by introducing a binary mask in the branch network and incorporating it into the loss term to improve convergence and generalization to new geometry tasks.Our approach is demonstrated on three benchmark problems: (1) learning different functional forms of the source term in the Fisher equation; (2) learning multiple geometries in a 2D Darcy Flow problem and showcasing better transfer learning capabilities to new geometries; and (3) learning 3D parameterized geometries for a heat transfer problem and demonstrate the ability to predict on new but similar geometries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our MT-DeepONet framework offers a novel approach to solving PDE problems in engineering and science under a unified umbrella based on synergistic learning that reduces the overall training cost for neural operators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities.When domain distribution changes, the fragility of subtle features leads to a pronounced deterioration in model performance.Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning both the commonality and specificity within categories.Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG.Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is achieved through a decorrelation function on disentangled segments, constraints on common feature consistency, specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration operation across granularities.By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories.Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.1% in terms of FGDG performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond that, the explainability analysis and experiments on various mainstream model architectures confirm the validity of FS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models (DM) represent one of the most advanced generative models today, yet recent studies suggest that DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.Backdoor attacks establish hidden associations between particular input patterns and model behaviors, compromising model integrity by triggering undesirable actions with manipulated input data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This vulnerability poses substantial risks, including reputational damage to model owners and the dissemination of harmful content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>To mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks, there have been some investigations on backdoor detection and model repair.However, previous work fails to purify the backdoored DMs created by state-of-the-art attacks, rendering the field much underexplored.To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Diff-Cleanse}, a novel two-stage backdoor defense framework specifically designed for DMs.The first stage employs a innovative trigger inversion technique to detect the backdoor and reconstruct the trigger, and the second stage utilizes a structural pruning method to eliminate the backdoor.We evaluate our framework on hundreds of DMs attacked by 3 existing backdoor attack methods.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-Cleanse achieves nearly 100\% detection accuracy and effectively mitigates backdoor impacts, preserving the model's benign performance with minimal compromise.Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/shymuel/diff-cleanse.</p>

                  <p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend the capacity of LLMs to comprehensively understand vision information, achieving remarkable performance in many vision-centric tasks.Despite that, recent studies have shown that these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which refer to an exploitative technique where malicious users can break the safety alignment of the target model and generate misleading and harmful answers.This potential threat is caused by both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLM and the larger attack scope introduced by vision input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks, researchers have developed various defense techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>However, these methods either require modifications to the model's internal structure or demand significant computational resources during the inference phase.Multimodal information is a double-edged sword.While it increases the risk of attacks, it also provides additional data that can enhance safeguards.Inspired by this, we propose $\underline{\textbf{C}}$ross-modality $\underline{\textbf{I}}$nformation $\underline{\textbf{DE}}$tecto$\underline{\textbf{R}}$ ($\textit{CIDER})$, a plug-and-play jailbreaking detector designed to identify maliciously perturbed image inputs, utilizing the cross-modal similarity between harmful queries and adversarial images.This simple yet effective cross-modality information detector, $\textit{CIDER}$, is independent of the target VLMs and requires less computation cost.Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of $\textit{CIDER}$, as well as its transferability to both white-box and black-box VLMs.</p>

                  <p>Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to sequentially learn new classes, while maintaining the capability to locate and identify old ones.As the training data arrives with annotations only with new classes, IOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting.Prior methodologies mainly tackle the forgetting issue through knowledge distillation and exemplar replay, ignoring the conflict between limited model capacity and increasing knowledge.In this paper, we explore \textit{dynamic object queries} for incremental object detection built on Transformer architecture.We propose the \textbf{Dy}namic object \textbf{Q}uery-based \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer (DyQ-DETR), which incrementally expands the model representation ability to achieve stability-plasticity tradeoff.First, a new set of learnable object queries are fed into the decoder to represent new classes.These new object queries are aggregated with those from previous phases to adapt both old and new knowledge well.Second, we propose the isolated bipartite matching for object queries in different phases, based on disentangled self-attention.The interaction among the object queries at different phases is eliminated to reduce inter-class confusion.Thanks to the separate supervision and computation over object queries, we further present the risk-balanced partial calibration for effective exemplar replay.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyQ-DETR significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, with limited parameter overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal machine learning models that combine visual and textual data are increasingly being deployed in critical applications, raising significant safety and security concerns due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks.This paper presents an effective strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal image captioning models against such attacks.By leveraging the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples and incorporating adversarial training techniques, we demonstrate improved model robustness on two benchmark datasets: Flickr8k and COCO.Our findings indicate that selectively training only the text decoder of the multimodal architecture shows performance comparable to full adversarial training while offering increased computational efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This targeted approach suggests a balance between robustness and training costs, facilitating the ethical deployment of multimodal AI systems across various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>
