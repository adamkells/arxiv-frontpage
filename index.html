                  <p>This paper proposes an assistive system for architects that converts a large-scale point cloud into a standardized digital representation of a building for Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications.The process is known as Scan-to-BIM, which requires many hours of manual work even for a single building floor by a professional architect.Given its challenging nature, the paper focuses on helping architects on the Scan-to-BIM process, instead of replacing them.Concretely, we propose an assistive Scan-to-BIM system that takes the raw sensor data and edit history (including the current BIM model), then auto-regressively predicts a sequence of model editing operations as APIs of a professional BIM software (i.e., Autodesk Revit).The paper also presents the first building-scale Scan2BIM dataset that contains a sequence of model editing operations as the APIs of Autodesk Revit.The dataset contains 89 hours of Scan2BIM modeling processes by professional architects over 16 scenes, spanning over 35,000 m^2.We report our system's reconstruction quality with standard metrics, and we introduce a novel metric that measures how natural the order of reconstructed operations is.A simple modification to the reconstruction module helps improve performance, and our method is far superior to two other baselines in the order metric.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release data, code, and models at a-scan2bim.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semantic part segmentation provides an intricate and interpretable understanding of an object, thereby benefiting numerous downstream tasks.However, the need for exhaustive annotations impedes its usage across diverse object types.This paper focuses on learning part segmentation from synthetic animals, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Animal Linear (SMAL) models to scale up existing synthetic data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) animal models.Compared to CAD models, SMAL models generate data with a wider range of poses observed in real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, our first contribution is to construct a synthetic animal dataset of tigers and horses with more pose diversity, termed Synthetic Animal Parts (SAP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>We then benchmark Syn-to-Real animal part segmentation from SAP to PartImageNet, namely SynRealPart, with existing semantic segmentation domain adaptation methods and further improve them as our second contribution.Concretely, we examine three Syn-to-Real adaptation methods but observe relative performance drop due to the innate difference between the two tasks.To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method called Class-Balanced Fourier Data Mixing (CB-FDM).Fourier Data Mixing aligns the spectral amplitudes of synthetic images with real images, thereby making the mixed images have more similar frequency content to real images.We further use Class-Balanced Pseudo-Label Re-Weighting to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution.We demonstrate the efficacy of CB-FDM on SynRealPart over previous methods with significant performance improvements.Remarkably, our third contribution is to reveal that the learned parts from synthetic tiger and horse are transferable across all quadrupeds in PartImageNet, further underscoring the utility and potential applications of animal part segmentation.</p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance.Many prior works have aimed to align with diverse aspects of the original datasets, such as matching the training weight trajectories, gradient, feature/BatchNorm distributions, etc.In this work, we show how to distill various large-scale datasets such as full ImageNet-1K/21K under a conventional input resolution of 224$\times$224 to achieve the best accuracy over all previous approaches, including SRe$^2$L, TESLA and MTT.To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective ${\bf C}$urriculum ${\bf D}$ata ${\bf A}$ugmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis that obtains the accuracy on large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2% under IPC (Images Per Class) 50 and 36.1% under IPC 20, respectively.Finally, we show that, by integrating all our enhancements together, the proposed model beats the current state-of-the-art by more than 4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K/21K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterpart to less than absolute 15%.Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on larger-scale ImageNet-21K under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and distilled ImageNet-21K dataset of 20 IPC, 2K recovery budget are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/SRe2L/tree/main/CDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks.The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K.

To confront the increasingly prominent issue of high dimensionality, we propose an extension of Quantile Graphs into a multivariate variant, which we term "Multilayer Quantile Graphs".In this innovative mapping, each time series is transformed into a Quantile Graph, and inter-layer connections are established to link contemporaneous quantiles of pairwise series.This enables the analysis of dynamic transitions across multiple dimensions.In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new mapping using a synthetic multivariate time series dataset.We delve into the resulting network's topological structures, extract network features, and employ these features for original dataset analysis.Furthermore, we compare our results with a recent method from the literature.The resulting multilayer network offers a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the original data while capturing serial and cross-dimensional transitions.This approach facilitates the characterization and analysis of large multivariate time series datasets through network analysis techniques.</p>

In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.946</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, short videos (SVs) are essential to information acquisition and sharing in our life.The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of emotion recognition in SVs.Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling.Some commonly used videos (e.g., facial expressions and postures) have been well studied.However, it is still challenging to understand the emotions in SVs.Since the enhanced content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists information gaps caused by the emotion incompleteness under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions.To tackle these problems, we present an end-to-end baseline method AV-CPNet that employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations.We further design the two-stage cross-modal fusion module to complementarily model the correlations of audio-visual features.The EP-CE Loss, incorporating three emotion polarities, is then applied to guide model optimization.Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the effectiveness of AV-CPNet.Datasets and code will be open on https://github.com/XuecWu/eMotions.</p>

                  <p>Modern personalized recommendation services often rely on user feedback, either explicit or implicit, to improve the quality of services.Explicit feedback refers to behaviors like ratings, while implicit feedback refers to behaviors like user clicks.However, in the scenario of full-screen video viewing experiences like Tiktok and Reels, the click action is absent, resulting in unclear feedback from users, hence introducing noises in modeling training.Existing approaches on de-noising recommendation mainly focus on positive instances while ignoring the noise in a large amount of sampled negative feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method to annotate the unlabeled data from loss and gradient perspectives, which considers the noises in both positive and negative instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Specifically, we first propose an Inverse Dual Loss (IDL) to boost the true label learning and prevent the false label learning.Then we further propose an Inverse Gradient (IG) method to explore the correct updating gradient and adjust the updating based on meta-learning.Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both benchmark and industrial datasets where our proposed method can significantly improve AUC by 9.25% against state-of-the-art methods.Further analysis verifies the proposed inverse learning framework is model-agnostic and can improve a variety of recommendation backbones.The source code, along with the best hyper-parameter settings, is available at this link: https://github.com/Guanyu-Lin/InverseLearning.</p>

                  <p>Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a family of methods for embedding pair-wise dissimilarities between $n$ objects into low-dimensional space.MDS is widely used as a data visualization tool in the social and biological sciences, statistics, and machine learning.We study the Kamada-Kawai formulation of MDS: given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\{d_{i,j}\}_{i , j \in[n]}$ over $n$ points, the goal is to find an embedding $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ that minimizes \[ \text{OPT} = \min_{x} \mathbb{E}_{i,j \in [n]} \left[ \left(1-\frac{\|x_i - x_j\|}{d_{i,j}}\right)^2 \right] \]   Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is extremely limited.Recently, Demaine, Hesterberg, Koehler, Lynch, and Urschel (arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provable guarantees for Kamada-Kawai, which achieves an embedding with cost $\text{OPT} +\epsilon$ in $n^2 \cdot 2^{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k \Delta^4 / \epsilon^2)}$ time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input dissimilarities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomial dependency on $\Delta$: for target dimension $k$, we achieve a solution with cost $\mathcal{O}(\text{OPT}^{ \hspace{0.04in}1/k } \cdot \log(\Delta/\epsilon) ) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>+ \epsilon$ in time $n^{ \mathcal{O}(1)} \cdot 2^{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( k^2 (\log(\Delta)/\epsilon)^{k/2 + 1} ) }$.   Our approach is based on a novel analysis of a conditioning-based rounding scheme for the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy.Crucially, our analysis exploits the geometry of low-dimensional Euclidean space, allowing us to avoid an exponential dependence on the aspect ratio $\Delta$. We believe our geometry-aware treatment of the Sherali-Adams Hierarchy is an important step towards developing general-purpose techniques for efficient metric optimization algorithms.</p>

                  <p>We revisit the problem of estimating the profile (also known as the rarity) in the data stream model.Given a sequence of $m$ elements from a universe of size $n$, its profile is a vector $\phi$ whose $i$-th entry $\phi_i$ represents the number of distinct elements that appear in the stream exactly $i$ times.A classic paper by Datar and Muthukrishan from 2002 gave an algorithm which estimates any entry $\phi_i$ up to an additive error of $\pm \epsilon D$ using $O(1/\epsilon^2 (\log n + \log m))$ bits of space, where $D$ is the number of distinct elements in the stream.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we considerably improve on this result by designing an algorithm which simultaneously estimates many coordinates of the profile vector $\phi$ up to small overall error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>We give an algorithm which, with constant probability, produces an estimated profile $\hat\phi$ with the following guarantees in terms of space and estimation error:   -For any constant $\tau$, with $O(1 / \epsilon^2 + \log n)$ bits of space, $\sum_{i=1}^\tau |\phi_i - \hat\phi_i| \leq \epsilon D$.   - With $O(1/ \epsilon^2\log (1/\epsilon) + \log n + \log \log m)$ bits of space, $\sum_{i=1}^m |\phi_i - \hat\phi_i| \leq \epsilon m$.   In addition to bounding the error across multiple coordinates, our space bounds separate the terms that depend on $1/\epsilon$ and those that depend on $n$ and $m$. We prove matching lower bounds on space in both regimes.Application of our profile estimation algorithm gives estimates within error $\pm \epsilon D$ of several symmetric functions of frequencies in $O(1/\epsilon^2 + \log n)$ bits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This generalizes space-optimal algorithms for the distinct elements problems to other problems including estimating the Huber and Tukey losses as well as frequency cap statistics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating the reliability of complex technical networks, such as those in energy distribution, logistics, and transportation systems, is of paramount importance.These networks are often represented as multistate flow networks (MFNs).While there has been considerable research on assessing MFN reliability, many studies still need to pay more attention to a critical factor: transmission distance constraints.These constraints are typical in real-world applications, such as Internet infrastructure, where controlling the distances between data centers, network nodes, and end-users is vital for ensuring low latency and efficient data transmission.This paper addresses the evaluation of MFN reliability under distance constraints.Specifically, it focuses on determining the probability that a minimum of $d$ flow units can be transmitted successfully from a source node to a sink node, using only paths with lengths not exceeding a predefined distance limit of $\lambda $.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce an effective algorithm to tackle this challenge, provide a benchmark example to illustrate its application and analyze its computational complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional 2D pose estimation models are limited by their category-specific design, making them suitable only for predefined object categories.This restriction becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects due to the lack of relevant training data.   To address this limitation, category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) was introduced.CAPE aims to enable keypoint localization for arbitrary object categories using a single model, requiring minimal support images with annotated keypoints.This approach not only enables object pose generation based on arbitrary keypoint definitions but also significantly reduces the associated costs, paving the way for versatile and adaptable pose estimation applications.   We present a novel approach to CAPE that leverages the inherent geometrical relations between keypoints through a newly designed Graph Transformer Decoder.By capturing and incorporating this crucial structural information, our method enhances the accuracy of keypoint localization, marking a significant departure from conventional CAPE techniques that treat keypoints as isolated entities.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach on the MP-100 benchmark, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 20,000 images spanning more than 100 categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by substantial margins, achieving remarkable improvements of 2.16% and 1.82% under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, our method's end-to-end training demonstrates both scalability and efficiency compared to previous CAPE approaches.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, designs are written in Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and debugged by hardware engineers.While this approach is effective, it is time-consuming and error-prone for complex designs.Large language models (LLMs) are promising in automating HDL code generation.LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can learn to generate code that compiles and is functionally accurate.We aim to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct HDL models.We build AutoChip by combining the interactive capabilities of LLMs and the output from Verilog simulations to generate Verilog modules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We start with a design prompt for a module and the context from compilation errors and debugging messages, which highlight differences between the expected and actual outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This ensures that accurate Verilog code can be generated without human intervention.We evaluate AutoChip using problem sets from HDLBits.We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the AutoChip using several LLMs and problem categories.The results show that incorporating context from compiler tools, such as Icarus Verilog, improves the effectiveness, yielding 24.20% more accurate Verilog.We release our evaluation scripts and datasets as open-source contributions at the following link https://github.com/shailja-thakur/AutoChip.</p>
