                  <p>Although diffusion models can generate high-quality human images, their applications are limited by the instability in generating hands with correct structures.Some previous works mitigate the problem by considering hand structure yet struggle to maintain style consistency between refined malformed hands and other image regions.In this paper, we aim to solve the problem of inconsistency regarding hand structure and style.We propose a conditional diffusion-based framework RHanDS to refine the hand region with the help of decoupled structure and style guidance.Specifically, the structure guidance is the hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand, serving to correct the hand structure.The style guidance is a hand image, e.g., the malformed hand itself, and is employed to furnish the style reference for hand refining.In order to suppress the structure leakage when referencing hand style and effectively utilize hand data to improve the capability of the model, we build a multi-style hand dataset and introduce a twostage training strategy.In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to generate hands with the same style as the reference.In the second stage, various hand images generated based on the human mesh are used for training to enable the model to gain control over the hand structure.We evaluate our method and counterparts on the test dataset of the proposed multi-style hand dataset.The experimental results show that RHanDS can effectively refine hands structure- and style- correctly compared with previous methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and datasets will be available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.962</span></span></p>

                  <p>The task of condensing large chunks of textual information into concise and structured tables has gained attention recently due to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential benefit for downstream tasks, such as text summarization and text mining.Previous approaches often generate tables that directly replicate information from the text, limiting their applicability in broader contexts, as text-to-table generation in real-life scenarios necessitates information extraction, reasoning, and integration.However, there is a lack of both datasets and methodologies towards this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce LiveSum, a new benchmark dataset created for generating summary tables of competitions based on real-time commentary texts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>We evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art LLMs on this task in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, and additionally propose a novel pipeline called $T^3$(Text-Tuple-Table) to improve their performances.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LLMs still struggle with this task even after fine-tuning, while our approach can offer substantial performance gains without explicit training.Further analyses demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization abilities, surpassing previous approaches on several other text-to-table datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/LiveSum-TTT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs).However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel.In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data.Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up.Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text.As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly.We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.931</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of multimodal foundation model has demonstrated significant progresses in vision-language understanding and generation, e.g., our previous work SEED-LLaMA.However, there remains a gap between its capability and the real-world applicability, primarily due to the model's limited capacity to effectively respond to various user instructions and interact with diverse visual data.In this work, we focus on bridging this gap through integrating two enhanced features: (1) comprehending images of arbitrary sizes and ratios, and (2) enabling multi-granularity image generation.We present a unified and versatile foundation model, namely, SEED-X, which is able to model multi-granularity visual semantics for comprehension and generation tasks.Besides the competitive results on public benchmarks, SEED-X demonstrates its effectiveness in handling real-world applications across various domains after instruction tuning.We hope that our work will inspire future research into what can be achieved by versatile multimodal foundation models in real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The models, codes, and datasets will be released in https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED-X. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rapid growth of information technology, users are exposed to a massive amount of data online, including image, music, and video.This has led to strong needs to provide effective corresponsive search services such as image, music, and video search services.Most of them are operated based on keywords, namely using keywords to find related image, music, and video.Additionally, there are image-to-image search services that enable users to find similar images using one input image.Given that videos are essentially composed of image frames, then similar videos can be searched by one input image or screenshot.We want to target this scenario and provide an efficient method and implementation in this paper.   We present Shotit, a cloud-native image-to-video search engine that tailors this search scenario in a compute-efficient approach.One main limitation faced in this scenario is the scale of its dataset.A typical image-to-image search engine only handles one-to-one relationships, colloquially, one image corresponds to another single image.But image-to-video proliferates.Take a 24-min length video as an example, it will generate roughly 20,000 image frames.As the number of videos grows, the scale of the dataset explodes exponentially.In this case, a compute-efficient approach ought to be considered, and the system design should cater to the cloud-native trend.Choosing an emerging technology - vector database as its backbone, Shotit fits these two metrics performantly.Experiments for two different datasets, a 50 thousand-scale Blender Open Movie dataset, and a 50 million-scale proprietary TV genre dataset at a 4 Core 32GB RAM Intel Xeon Gold 6271C cloud machine with object storage reveal the effectiveness of Shotit.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A demo regarding the Blender Open Movie dataset is illustrated within this paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span></p>

                  <p>Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages.As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce.   Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language.However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work.This has limited progress in the field.This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem.Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation.Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach.   By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign.Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation.Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens.Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network.Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.889</span></span>An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%.</p>

                  <p>Multi-view learning methods often focus on improving decision accuracy while neglecting the decision uncertainty, which significantly restricts their applications in safety-critical applications.To address this issue, researchers propose trusted multi-view methods that learn the class distribution for each instance, enabling the estimation of classification probabilities and uncertainty.However, these methods heavily rely on high-quality ground-truth labels.This motivates us to delve into a new generalized trusted multi-view learning problem: how to develop a reliable multi-view learning model under the guidance of noisy labels?We propose a trusted multi-view noise refining method to solve this problem.We first construct view-opinions using evidential deep neural networks, which consist of belief mass vectors and uncertainty estimates.Subsequently, we design view-specific noise correlation matrices that transform the original opinions into noisy opinions aligned with the noisy labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Considering label noises originating from low-quality data features and easily-confused classes, we ensure that the diagonal elements of these matrices are inversely proportional to the uncertainty, while incorporating class relations into the off-diagonal elements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Finally, we aggregate the noisy opinions and employ a generalized maximum likelihood loss on the aggregated opinion for model training, guided by the noisy labels.We empirically compare TMNR with state-of-the-art trusted multi-view learning and label noise learning baselines on 5 publicly available datasets.Experiment results show that TMNR outperforms baseline methods on accuracy, reliability and robustness.We promise to release the code and all datasets on Github and show the link here.</p>

                  <p>The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes.Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes.To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data.In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach.SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS).Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model.3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span></p>

                  <p>Eye-tracking technology is integral to numerous consumer electronics applications, particularly in the realm of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR).These applications demand solutions that excel in three crucial aspects: low-latency, low-power consumption, and precision.Yet, achieving optimal performance across all these fronts presents a formidable challenge, necessitating a balance between sophisticated algorithms and efficient backend hardware implementations.In this study, we tackle this challenge through a synergistic software/hardware co-design of the system with an event camera.Leveraging the inherent sparsity of event-based input data, we integrate a novel sparse FPGA dataflow accelerator customized for submanifold sparse convolution neural networks (SCNN).The SCNN implemented on the accelerator can efficiently extract the embedding feature vector from each representation of event slices by only processing the non-zero activations.Subsequently, these vectors undergo further processing by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and a fully connected layer on the host CPU to generate the eye centers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Deployment and evaluation of our system reveal outstanding performance metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>On the Event-based Eye-Tracking-AIS2024 dataset, our system achieves 81% p5 accuracy, 99.5% p10 accuracy, and 3.71 Mean Euclidean Distance with 0.7 ms latency while only consuming 2.29 mJ per inference.Notably, our solution opens up opportunities for future eye-tracking systems.Code is available at https://github.com/CASR-HKU/ESDA/tree/eye_tracking.</p>

                  <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has proven to be an important part of many robotics systems.Surface normals estimated from LiDAR data are commonly used for a variety of tasks in such systems.As most of the today's mechanical LiDAR sensors produce sparse data, estimating normals from a single scan in a robust manner poses difficulties.   In this paper, we address the problem of estimating normals for sparse LiDAR data avoiding the typical issues of smoothing out the normals in high curvature areas.   Mechanical LiDARs rotate a set of rigidly mounted lasers.One firing of such a set of lasers produces an array of points where each point's neighbor is known due to the known firing pattern of the scanner.We use this knowledge to connect these points to their neighbors and label them using the angles of the lines connecting them.When estimating normals at these points, we only consider points with the same label as neighbors.This allows us to avoid estimating normals in high curvature areas.   We evaluate our approach on various data, both self-recorded and publicly available, acquired using various sparse LiDAR sensors.We show that using our method for normal estimation leads to normals that are more robust in areas with high curvature which leads to maps of higher quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that our method only incurs a constant factor runtime overhead with respect to a lightweight baseline normal estimation procedure and is therefore suited for operation in computationally demanding environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm that allows different clients to train one powerful global model without sharing their private data.Although FL has demonstrated promising results in various applications, it is known to suffer from convergence issues caused by the data distribution shift across different clients, especially on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data.In this paper, we study the convergence of FL on non-IID data and propose a novel \emph{Dog Walking Theory} to formulate and identify the missing element in existing research.The Dog Walking Theory describes the process of a dog walker leash walking multiple dogs from one side of the park to the other.The goal of the dog walker is to arrive at the right destination while giving the dogs enough exercise (i.e., space exploration).In FL, the server is analogous to the dog walker while the clients are analogous to the dogs.This analogy allows us to identify one crucial yet missing element in existing FL algorithms: the leash that guides the exploration of the clients.To address this gap, we propose a novel FL algorithm \emph{FedWalk} that leverages an external easy-to-converge task at the server side as a \emph{leash task} to guide the local training of the clients.We theoretically analyze the convergence of FedWalk with respect to data heterogeneity (between server and clients) and task discrepancy (between the leash and the original tasks).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedWalk over state-of-the-art FL methods under both IID and non-IID settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Powered hip exoskeletons have shown the ability for locomotion assistance during treadmill walking.However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging.Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information.In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label.We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride.We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands.We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.Codes and data are available at https://github.com/RuoqiZhao116/SFTIK.</p>

                  <p>Industrial datapath designers consider dynamic power consumption to be a key metric.Arithmetic circuits contribute a major component of total chip power consumption and are therefore a common target for power optimization.While arithmetic circuit area and dynamic power consumption are often correlated, there is also a tradeoff to consider, as additional gates can be added to explicitly reduce arithmetic circuit activity and hence reduce power consumption.In this work, we consider two forms of power optimization and their interaction: circuit area reduction via arithmetic optimization, and the elimination of redundant computations using both data and clock gating.By encoding both these classes of optimization as local rewrites of expressions, our tool flow can simultaneously explore them, uncovering new opportunities for power saving through arithmetic rewrites using the e-graph data structure.Since power consumption is highly dependent upon the workload performed by the circuit, our tool flow facilitates a data dependent design paradigm, where an implementation is automatically tailored to particular contexts of data activity.We develop an automated RTL to RTL optimization framework, ROVER, that takes circuit input stimuli and generates power-efficient architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effectiveness on both open-source arithmetic benchmarks and benchmarks derived from Intel production examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>The tool is able to reduce the total power consumption by up to 33.9%.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of connected vehicles is driven by increasing customer and regulatory demands.To meet these, more complex software applications, some of which require service-based cloud and edge backends, are developed.When new software is deployed however, the high complexity and interdependencies between components can lead to unforeseen side effects in other system parts.As such, it becomes more challenging to recognize whether deviations to the intended system behavior are occurring, ultimately resulting in higher monitoring efforts and slower responses to errors.To overcome this problem, a simulation of the cloud environment running in parallel to the system is proposed.This approach enables the live comparison between simulated and real cloud behavior.Therefore, a concept is developed mirroring the existing cloud system into a simulation.To collect the necessary data, an observability platform is presented, capturing telemetry and architecture information.Subsequently, a simulation environment is designed that converts the architecture into a simulation model and simulates its dynamic workload by utilizing captured communication data.The proposed concept is evaluated in a real-world application scenario for electric vehicle charging: Vehicles can apply for an unoccupied charging station at a cloud service backend, the latter which manages all incoming requests and performs the assignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Benchmarks are conducted by comparing the collected telemetry data with the simulated results under different loads and injected faults. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>The results show that regular cloud behavior is mirrored well by the simulation and that misbehavior due to fault injection is well visible, indicating that simulations are a promising data source for anomaly detection in connected vehicle cloud environments during operation.</p>

                  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate heterogeneous data over time; and relying solely on individual data points is inadequate for accurate analysis.   Segmentation is a common preprocessing step in many IoT applications, including IoT-based activity recognition, aiming to address the limitations of individual events and streamline the process.However, this step introduces at least two families of uncontrollable biases.The first is caused by the changes made by the segmentation process on the initial problem space, such as dividing the input data into 60 seconds windows.The second category of biases results from the segmentation process itself, including the fixation of the segmentation method and its parameters.   To address these biases, we propose to redefine the segmentation problem as a special case of a decomposition problem, including three key components: a decomposer, resolutions, and a composer.   The inclusion of the composer task in the segmentation process facilitates an assessment of the relationship between the original problem and the problem after the segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, It leads to an improvement in the evaluation process and, consequently, in the selection of the appropriate segmentation method.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Then, we formally introduce our novel meta-decomposition or learning-to-decompose approach.It reduces the segmentation biases by considering the segmentation as a hyperparameter to be optimized by the outer learning problem.Therefore, meta-decomposition improves the overall system performance by dynamically selecting the appropriate segmentation method without including the mentioned biases.Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment.A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors.Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space.For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements.Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces.We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations.While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths.Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces.We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding.Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation.The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space.These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p>

                  <p>Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs.Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily.Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees.Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model.Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Accurate spatio-temporal information about the current situation is crucial for smart city applications such as modern routing algorithms.Often, this information describes the state of stationary resources, e.g. the availability of parking bays, charging stations or the amount of people waiting for a vehicle to pick them up near a given location.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To exploit this kind of information, predicting future states of the monitored resources is often mandatory because a resource might change its state within the time until it is needed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>To train an accurate predictive model, it is often not possible to obtain a continuous time series on the state of the resource.For example, the information might be collected from traveling agents visiting the resource with an irregular frequency.Thus, it is necessary to develop methods which work on sparse observations for training and prediction.In this paper, we propose time-inhomogeneous discrete Markov models to allow accurate prediction even when the frequency of observation is very rare.Our new model is able to blend recent observations with historic data and also provide useful probabilistic estimates for future states.Since resources availability in a city is typically time-dependent, our Markov model is time-inhomogeneous and cyclic within a predefined time interval.To train our model, we propose a modified Baum-Welch algorithm.Evaluations on real-world datasets of parking bay availability show that our new method indeed yields good results compared to methods being trained on complete data and non-cyclic variants.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective technique for addressing the irrational thoughts stemming from mental illnesses, but it necessitates precise identification of cognitive pathways to be successfully implemented in patient care.In current society, individuals frequently express negative emotions on social media on specific topics, often exhibiting cognitive distortions, including suicidal behaviors in extreme cases.Yet, there is a notable absence of methodologies for analyzing cognitive pathways that could aid psychotherapists in conducting effective interventions online.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we gathered data from social media and established the task of extracting cognitive pathways, annotating the data based on a cognitive theoretical framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>We initially categorized the task of extracting cognitive pathways as a hierarchical text classification with four main categories and nineteen subcategories.Following this, we structured a text summarization task to help psychotherapists quickly grasp the essential information.Our experiments evaluate the performance of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) on these tasks.The results demonstrate that our deep learning method achieved a micro-F1 score of 62.34% in the hierarchical text classification task.Meanwhile, in the text summarization task, GPT-4 attained a Rouge-1 score of 54.92 and a Rouge-2 score of 30.86, surpassing the experimental deep learning model's performance.However, it may suffer from an issue of hallucination.We have made all models and codes publicly available to support further research in this field.</p>

We find that otherwise highly-capable language models demonstrate surprisingly limited time series reasoning: they score marginally above random on etiological and question answering tasks (up to 30 percentage points worse than humans) and show modest success in using context to improve forecasting.These weakness showcase that time series reasoning is an impactful, yet deeply underdeveloped direction for language model research.We also make our datasets and code public at to support further research in this direction at https://github.com/behavioral-data/TSandLanguage</p>

                  <p>Data-driven applications and services have been increasingly deployed in all aspects of life including healthcare and medical services in which a huge amount of personal data is collected, aggregated, and processed in a centralised server from various sources.As a consequence, preserving the data privacy and security of these applications is of paramount importance.Since May 2018, the new data protection legislation in the EU/UK, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has come into force and this has called for a critical need for modelling compliance with the GDPR's sophisticated requirements.Existing threat modelling techniques are not designed to model GDPR compliance, particularly in a complex system where personal data is collected, processed, manipulated, and shared with third parties.In this paper, we present a novel comprehensive solution for developing a threat modelling technique to address threats of non-compliance and mitigate them by taking GDPR requirements as the baseline and combining them with the existing security and privacy modelling techniques (i.e., \textit{STRIDE} and \textit{LINDDUN}, respectively).For this purpose, we propose a new data flow diagram integrated with the GDPR principles, develop a knowledge base for the non-compliance threats, and leverage an inference engine for reasoning the GDPR non-compliance threats over the knowledge base.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate our solution for threats of non-compliance with legal basis and accountability in a telehealth system to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing deep learning-based models for automated code completion.Although using source code in GitHub has been a common practice for training deep-learning-based models for code completion, it may induce some legal and ethical issues such as copyright infringement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we investigate the legal and ethical issues of current neural code completion models by answering the following question: Is my code used to train your neural code completion model? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>To this end, we tailor a membership inference approach (termed CodeMI) that was originally crafted for classification tasks to a more challenging task of code completion.In particular, since the target code completion models perform as opaque black boxes, preventing access to their training data and parameters, we opt to train multiple shadow models to mimic their behavior.The acquired posteriors from these shadow models are subsequently employed to train a membership classifier.Subsequently, the membership classifier can be effectively employed to deduce the membership status of a given code sample based on the output of a target code completion model.We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of this adapted approach across a diverse array of neural code completion models, (i.e., LSTM-based, CodeGPT, CodeGen, and StarCoder).Experimental results reveal that the LSTM-based and CodeGPT models suffer the membership leakage issue, which can be easily detected by our proposed membership inference approach with an accuracy of 0.842, and 0.730, respectively.Interestingly, our experiments also show that the data membership of current large language models of code, e.g., CodeGen and StarCoder, is difficult to detect, leaving amper space for further improvement.Finally, we also try to explain the findings from the perspective of model memorization.</p>

                  <p>Deep models trained on large amounts of data often incorporate implicit biases present during training time.If later such a bias is discovered during inference or deployment, it is often necessary to acquire new data and retrain the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This behavior is especially problematic in critical areas such as autonomous driving or medical decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>In these scenarios, new data is often expensive and hard to come by.In this work, we present a method based on change penalization that takes a pre-trained model and adapts the weights to mitigate a previously detected bias.We achieve this by tuning a zero-initialized copy of a frozen pre-trained network.Our method needs very few, in extreme cases only a single, examples that contradict the bias to increase performance.Additionally, we propose an early stopping criterion to modify baselines and reduce overfitting.We evaluate our approach on a well-known bias in skin lesion classification and three other datasets from the domain shift literature.We find that our approach works especially well with very few images.Simple fine-tuning combined with our early stopping also leads to performance benefits for a larger number of tuning samples.</p>

                  <p>Trajectory streams are being generated from location-aware devices, such as smartphones and in-vehicle navigation systems.Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues.Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis.Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications.To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams.Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy.We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios.The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p>
