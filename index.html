                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks.The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, our AlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with other state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset will be available at \href{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span></p>

                  <p>Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment.Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors.However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations.To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF.Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape.This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and supplementary material are available at: https://touchsdf.github.io/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span></p>

To confront the increasingly prominent issue of high dimensionality, we propose an extension of Quantile Graphs into a multivariate variant, which we term "Multilayer Quantile Graphs".In this innovative mapping, each time series is transformed into a Quantile Graph, and inter-layer connections are established to link contemporaneous quantiles of pairwise series.This enables the analysis of dynamic transitions across multiple dimensions.In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new mapping using a synthetic multivariate time series dataset.We delve into the resulting network's topological structures, extract network features, and employ these features for original dataset analysis.Furthermore, we compare our results with a recent method from the literature.The resulting multilayer network offers a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the original data while capturing serial and cross-dimensional transitions.This approach facilitates the characterization and analysis of large multivariate time series datasets through network analysis techniques.</p>

In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.946</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have mostly focused on application-driven tasks such as complex reasoning and code generation, and this has led to a scarcity in purely linguistic evaluation of LLMs.Against this background, we introduce Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability -- MELA, the first multilingual benchmark on linguistic acceptability with 48K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of language families.We establish baselines of commonly used LLMs along with supervised models, and conduct cross-lingual transfer and multi-task learning experiments with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we analyze the weights of fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the possibility of identifying transfer difficulty between languages.Our results show that ChatGPT benefits much from in-context examples but still lags behind fine-tuned XLM-R, while the performance of GPT-4 is on par with fine-tuned XLM-R even in zero-shot setting.Cross-lingual and multi-task learning experiments show that unlike semantic tasks, in-language training data is crucial in acceptability judgements.Results in layerwise probing indicate that the upper layers of XLM-R become a task-specific but language-agnostic region for multilingual acceptability judgment.We also introduce the concept of conflicting weight, which could be a potential indicator for the difficulty of cross-lingual transfer between languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data will be available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/MELA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span></p>

                  <p>Social media discourse from US politicians frequently consists of 'seemingly similar language used by opposing sides of the political spectrum'.But often, it translates to starkly contrasting real-world actions.For instance, "We need to keep our students safe from mass shootings" may signal either "arming teachers to stop the shooter" or "banning guns to reduce mass shootings" depending on who says it and their political stance on the issue.In this paper, we define and characterize the context that is required to fully understand such ambiguous statements in a computational setting and ground them in real-world entities, actions, and attitudes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To that end, we propose two challenging datasets that require an understanding of the real-world context of the text to be solved effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>We benchmark these datasets against baselines built upon large pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3, etc.Additionally, we develop and benchmark more structured baselines building upon existing 'Discourse Contextualization Framework' and 'Political Actor Representation' models.We perform analysis of the datasets and baseline predictions to obtain further insights into the pragmatic language understanding challenges posed by the proposed social grounding tasks.</p>

                  <p>Are Large language models (LLMs) temporally grounded?Since LLMs cannot perceive and interact with the environment, it is impossible to answer this question directly.Instead, we provide LLMs with textual narratives and probe them with respect to their common-sense knowledge of the structure and duration of events, their ability to order events along a timeline, and self-consistency within their temporal model (e.g., temporal relations such as after and before are mutually exclusive for any pair of events).We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (such as LLaMA 2 and GPT-4) on three tasks reflecting these abilities.Generally, we find that LLMs lag significantly behind both human performance as well as small-scale, specialised LMs.In-context learning, instruction tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting reduce this gap only to a limited degree.Crucially, LLMs struggle the most with self-consistency, displaying incoherent behaviour in at least 27.23% of their predictions.Contrary to expectations, we also find that scaling the model size does not guarantee positive gains in performance.To explain these results, we study the sources from which LLMs may gather temporal information: we find that sentence ordering in unlabelled texts, available during pre-training, is only weakly correlated with event ordering.Moreover, public instruction tuning mixtures contain few temporal tasks.Hence, we conclude that current LLMs lack a consistent temporal model of textual narratives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, datasets, and LLM outputs are available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/temporal-llms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern personalized recommendation services often rely on user feedback, either explicit or implicit, to improve the quality of services.Explicit feedback refers to behaviors like ratings, while implicit feedback refers to behaviors like user clicks.However, in the scenario of full-screen video viewing experiences like Tiktok and Reels, the click action is absent, resulting in unclear feedback from users, hence introducing noises in modeling training.Existing approaches on de-noising recommendation mainly focus on positive instances while ignoring the noise in a large amount of sampled negative feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method to annotate the unlabeled data from loss and gradient perspectives, which considers the noises in both positive and negative instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Specifically, we first propose an Inverse Dual Loss (IDL) to boost the true label learning and prevent the false label learning.Then we further propose an Inverse Gradient (IG) method to explore the correct updating gradient and adjust the updating based on meta-learning.Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both benchmark and industrial datasets where our proposed method can significantly improve AUC by 9.25% against state-of-the-art methods.Further analysis verifies the proposed inverse learning framework is model-agnostic and can improve a variety of recommendation backbones.The source code, along with the best hyper-parameter settings, is available at this link: https://github.com/Guanyu-Lin/InverseLearning.</p>

                  <p>The optimization of traffic signal control (TSC) is critical for an efficient transportation system.In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have emerged as a popular approach for TSC and show promising results for highly adaptive control.However, existing RL-based methods suffer from notably poor real-world applicability and hardly have any successful deployments.The reasons for such failures are mostly due to the reliance on over-idealized traffic simulators for policy optimization, as well as using unrealistic fine-grained state observations and reward signals that are not directly obtainable from real-world sensors.In this paper, we propose a fully Data-Driven and simulator-free framework for realistic Traffic Signal Control (D2TSC).Specifically, we combine well-established traffic flow theory with machine learning to construct a reward inference model to infer the reward signals from coarse-grained traffic data.With the inferred rewards, we further propose a sample-efficient offline RL method to enable direct signal control policy learning from historical offline datasets of real-world intersections.To evaluate our approach, we collect historical traffic data from a real-world intersection, and develop a highly customized simulation environment that strictly follows real data characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach achieves superior performance over conventional and offline RL baselines, and also enjoys much better real-world applicability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span></p>

                  <p>To alleviate the cost of regression testing in continuous integration (CI), a large number of machine learning-based (ML-based) test case prioritization techniques have been proposed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, it is yet unknown how they perform under the same experimental setup, because they are evaluated on different datasets with different metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive study on these ML-based techniques in this paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>We investigate the performance of 11 representative ML-based prioritization techniques for CI on 11 open-source subjects and obtain a series of findings.For example, the performance of the techniques changes across CI cycles, mainly resulting from the changing amount of training data, instead of code evolution and test removal/addition.Based on the findings, we give some actionable suggestions on enhancing the effectiveness of ML-based techniques, e.g., pretraining a prioritization technique with cross-subject data to get it thoroughly trained and then finetuning it with within-subject data dramatically improves its performance.In particular, the pretrained MART achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing the optimal sequence on 80% subjects, while the existing best technique, the original MART, only produces the optimal sequence on 50% subjects.</p>

                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K.

                  <p>Typically, autonomous driving adopts a modular design, which divides the full stack into perception, prediction, planning and control parts.Though interpretable, such modular design tends to introduce a substantial amount of redundancy.Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLM) and diffusion techniques have demonstrated their superior performance on comprehension and generation ability.In this paper, we first introduce the concept of interleaved vision-action pair, which unifies the format of visual features and control signals.Based on the vision-action pairs, we construct a general world model based on MLLM and diffusion model for autonomous driving, termedADriver-I. It takes the vision-action pairs as inputs and autoregressively predicts the control signal of the current frame.The generated control signals together with the historical vision-action pairs are further conditioned to predict the future frames.With the predicted next frame, ADriver-I performs further control signal prediction.Such a process can be repeated infinite times, ADriver-I achieves autonomous driving in the world created by itself.Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and our large-scale private datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ADriver-I shows impressive performance compared to several constructed baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>We hope our ADriver-I can provide some new insights for future autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Scaling the size of language models to tens of billions of parameters has led to impressive performance on a wide range of tasks.At generation, these models are used auto-regressively, requiring a forward pass for each generated token, and thus reading the full set of parameters from memory.This memory access forms the primary bottleneck for generation and it worsens as the model size increases.Moreover, executing a forward pass for multiple tokens in parallel often takes nearly the same time as it does for just one token.These two observations lead to the development of speculative sampling, where a second smaller model is used to draft a few tokens, that are then validated or rejected using a single forward pass of the large model.Unfortunately, this method requires two models that share the same tokenizer and thus limits its adoption.As an alternative, we propose to use parallel decoding as a way to draft multiple tokens from a single model with no computational cost, nor the need for a second model.Our approach only requires an additional input token that marks the words that will be generated simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show promising performance (up to $30\%$ speed-up) while requiring only as few as $O(d_{emb})$ additional parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained substantial attention across diverse application domains and theoretical investigations.Existing literature on RL theory largely focuses on risk-neutral settings where the decision-maker learns to maximize the expected cumulative reward.However, in practical scenarios such as portfolio management and e-commerce recommendations, decision-makers often persist in heterogeneous risk preferences subject to outcome uncertainties, which can not be well-captured by the risk-neural framework.Incorporating these preferences can be approached through utility theory, yet the development of risk-sensitive RL under general utility functions remains an open question for theoretical exploration.   In this paper, we consider a scenario where the decision-maker seeks to optimize a general utility function of the cumulative reward in the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP).To facilitate the Dynamic Programming Principle and Bellman equation, we enlarge the state space with an additional dimension that accounts for the cumulative reward.We propose a discretized approximation scheme to the MDP under enlarged state space, which is tractable and key for algorithmic design.We then propose a modified value iteration algorithm that employs an epsilon-covering over the space of cumulative reward.When a simulator is accessible, our algorithm efficiently learns a near-optimal policy with guaranteed sample complexity.In the absence of a simulator, our algorithm, designed with an upper-confidence-bound exploration approach, identifies a near-optimal policy while ensuring a guaranteed regret bound.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For both algorithms, we match the theoretical lower bounds for the risk-neutral setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this study, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models to complement biomedical knowledge graphs in the training of semantic models for the biomedical and clinical domains.Drawing on the wealth of the UMLS knowledge graph and harnessing cutting-edge Large Language Models, we propose a new state-of-the-art approach for obtaining high-fidelity representations of biomedical concepts and sentences, consisting of three steps: an improved contrastive learning phase, a novel self-distillation phase, and a weight averaging phase.Through rigorous evaluations via the extensive BioLORD testing suite and diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate consistent and substantial performance improvements over the previous state of the art (e.g. +2pts on MedSTS, +2.5pts on MedNLI-S, +6.1pts on EHR-Rel-B).Besides our new state-of-the-art biomedical model for English, we also distill and release a multilingual model compatible with 50+ languages and finetuned on 7 European languages.Many clinical pipelines can benefit from our latest models.Our new multilingual model enables a range of languages to benefit from our advancements in biomedical semantic representation learning, opening a new avenue for bioinformatics researchers around the world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, we hope to see BioLORD-2023 becoming a precious tool for future biomedical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>While performance of many text classification tasks has been recently improved due to Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), in this paper we show that they still suffer from a performance gap when the underlying distribution of topics changes.For example, a genre classifier trained on \textit{political} topics often fails when tested on documents about \textit{sport} or \textit{medicine}.In this work, we quantify this phenomenon empirically with a large corpus and a large set of topics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, we verify that domain transfer remains challenging both for classic PLMs, such as BERT, and for modern large models, such as GPT-3. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We also suggest and successfully test a possible remedy: after augmenting the training dataset with topically-controlled synthetic texts, the F1 score improves by up to 50\% for some topics, nearing on-topic training results, while others show little to no improvement.While our empirical results focus on genre classification, our methodology is applicable to other classification tasks such as gender, authorship, or sentiment classification.The code and data to replicate the experiments are available at https://github.com/dminus1/genre</p>

                  <p>Virtual try-on has become a popular research topic, but most existing methods focus on studio images with a clean background.They can achieve plausible results for this studio try-on setting by learning to warp a garment image to fit a person's body from paired training data, i.e., garment images paired with images of people wearing the same garment.Such data is often collected from commercial websites, where each garment is demonstrated both by itself and on several models.By contrast, it is hard to collect paired data for in-the-wild scenes, and therefore, virtual try-on for casual images of people against cluttered backgrounds is rarely studied.   In this work, we fill the gap in the current virtual try-on research by (1) introducing a Street TryOn benchmark to evaluate performance on street scenes and (2) proposing a novel method that can learn without paired data, from a set of in-the-wild person images directly.Our method can achieve robust performance across shop and street domains using a novel DensePose warping correction method combined with diffusion-based inpainting controlled by pose and semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance for standard studio try-on tasks and SOTA performance for street try-on and cross-domain try-on tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>
