                  <p>Transfer learning aims to boost the learning on the target task leveraging knowledge learned from other relevant tasks.However, when the source and target are not closely related, the learning performance may be adversely affected, a phenomenon known as negative transfer.In this paper, we investigate the negative transfer in graph transfer learning, which is important yet underexplored.We reveal that, unlike image or text, negative transfer commonly occurs in graph-structured data, even when source and target graphs share semantic similarities.Specifically, we identify that structural differences significantly amplify the dissimilarities in the node embeddings across graphs.To mitigate this, we bring a new insight: for semantically similar graphs, although structural differences lead to significant distribution shift in node embeddings, their impact on subgraph embeddings could be marginal.Building on this insight, we introduce two effective yet elegant methods, Subgraph Pooling (SP) and Subgraph Pooling++ (SP++), that transfer subgraph-level knowledge across graphs.We theoretically analyze the role of SP in reducing graph discrepancy and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its superiority under various settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/Subgraph-Pooling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current language model-driven agents often lack mechanisms for effective user participation, which is crucial given the vagueness commonly found in user instructions.Although adept at devising strategies and performing tasks, these agents struggle with seeking clarification and grasping precise user intentions.To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries.Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction.Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution.Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the data and codes are released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span></p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that young university students have had to adapt their learning and have a reduced relational context.Adversity contexts build models of human behaviour based on relationships.However, there is a lack of studies that analyse the behaviour of university students based on their social structure in the context of a pandemic.This information could be useful in making decisions on how to plan collective responses to adversities.The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method has been chosen to address this structural perspective.The aim of our research is to describe the structural behaviour of students in university residences during the COVID-19 pandemic with a more in-depth analysis of student leaders.A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at one Spanish Public University, Le\'on, from 23th October 2020 to 20th November 2020.The participation was of 93 students, from four halls of residence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data were collected from a database created specifically at the university to "track" contacts in the COVID-19 pandemic, SiVeUle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>We applied the SNA for the analysis of the data.The leadership on the university residence was measured using centrality measures.The top leaders were analyzed using the Egonetwork and an assessment of the key players.Students with higher social reputations experience higher levels of pandemic contagion in relation to COVID-19 infection.The results were statistically significant between the centrality in the network and the results of the COVID-19 infection.The most leading students showed a high degree of Betweenness, and three students had the key player structure in the network.Networking behaviour of university students in halls of residence could be related to contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p>Microbial communities play a key role in biological wastewater treatment processes.Activated sludge settling characteristics, for example, are affected by microbial community composition, varying by changes in operating conditions and influent characteristics of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).Timely assessment and prediction of changes in microbial composition leading to settling problems, such as filamentous bulking (FB), can prevent operational challenges, reductions in treatment efficiency, and adverse environmental impacts.This study presents an innovative computer vision-based approach to assess activated sludge-settling characteristics based on the morphological properties of flocs and filaments in microscopy images.Implementing the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing quantitative image analysis techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The offline microscopy image dataset was collected over two years, with weekly sampling at a full-scale industrial WWTP in Belgium. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>Multiple data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the CNN models.Various CNN architectures, including Inception v3, ResNet18, ResNet152, ConvNeXt-nano, and ConvNeXt-S, were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting sludge settling characteristics.The sludge volume index was used as the final prediction variable, but the method can easily be adjusted to predict any other settling metric of choice.The results showed that the suggested CNN-based approach provides less labour-intensive, objective, and consistent assessments, while transfer learning notably minimises the training phase, resulting in a generalizable system that can be employed in real-time applications.</p>

                  <p>Repetitive DNA (repeats) poses significant challenges for accurate and efficient genome assembly and sequence alignment.This is particularly true for metagenomic data, where genome dynamics such as horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and gene loss/gain complicate accurate genome assembly from metagenomic communities.Detecting repeats is a crucial first step in overcoming these challenges.To address this issue, we propose GraSSRep, a novel approach that leverages the assembly graph's structure through graph neural networks (GNNs) within a self-supervised learning framework to classify DNA sequences into repetitive and non-repetitive categories.Specifically, we frame this problem as a node classification task within a metagenomic assembly graph.In a self-supervised fashion, we rely on a high-precision (but low-recall) heuristic to generate pseudo-labels for a small proportion of the nodes.We then use those pseudo-labels to train a GNN embedding and a random forest classifier to propagate the labels to the remaining nodes.In this way, GraSSRep combines sequencing features with pre-defined and learned graph features to achieve state-of-the-art performance in repeat detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method using simulated and synthetic metagenomic datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>The results on the simulated data highlight our GraSSRep's robustness to repeat attributes, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling the complexity of repeated sequences.Additionally, our experiments with synthetic metagenomic datasets reveal that incorporating the graph structure and the GNN enhances our detection performance.Finally, in comparative analyses, GraSSRep outperforms existing repeat detection tools with respect to precision and recall.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access.These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database.Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models.However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing.This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system.We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models.For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models.We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time.Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments.Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown remarkable perceptual capability in answering visual questions, however, little is known about the limits of their perception.In particular, while prior works have provided anecdotal evidence of MLLMs' sensitivity to object size, this phenomenon and its underlying causes have not been explored comprehensively.In this work, we quantitatively study the perception of small visual objects in several state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a pervasive limitation in answering questions about small objects in images.Next, we identify four independent factors that can contribute to this limitation -- object quality, size, distractors, and location -- and conduct controlled intervention studies to measure the effect of each factor on MLLMs' perception.In particular, we find that lower object quality and smaller object size can both independently reduce MLLMs' ability to answer visual questions.More surprisingly, we find that the location of the object in the image and the presence of visual distractors can also significantly reduce MLLMs' question answering accuracy.Our study provides a better understanding of the perceptual limitation of MLLMs and contributes new evaluation protocols for analyzing the perception of future MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further investigations, we release our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Loneliness is a growing health concern as it can lead to depression and other associated mental health problems for people who experience feelings of loneliness over prolonged periods of time.Utilizing passive sensing methods that use smartphone and wearable sensor data to capture daily behavioural patterns offers a promising approach for the early detection of loneliness.Given the subjective nature of loneliness and people's varying daily routines, past detection approaches using machine learning models often face challenges with effectively detecting loneliness.This paper proposes a methodologically novel approach, particularly developing a loneliness detection system that evolves over time, adapts to new data, and provides real-time detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study utilized the Globem dataset, a comprehensive collection of passive sensing data acquired over 10 weeks from university students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>The base of our approach is the continuous identification and refinement of similar behavioural groups among students using an incremental clustering method.As we add new data, the model improves based on changing behavioural patterns.Parallel to this, we create and update classification models to detect loneliness among the evolving behavioural groups of students.When unique behavioural patterns are observed among student data, specialized classification models have been created.For predictions of loneliness, a collaborative effort between the generalized and specialized models is employed, treating each prediction as a vote.This study's findings reveal that group-based loneliness detection models exhibit superior performance compared to generic models, underscoring the necessity for more personalized approaches tailored to specific behavioural patterns.These results pave the way for future research, emphasizing the development of finely-tuned, individualized mental health interventions.</p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the era of widespread social networks, the rapid dissemination of fake news has emerged as a significant threat, inflicting detrimental consequences across various dimensions of people's lives.Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been extensively employed for identifying fake news.However, a significant challenge in identifying fake news is the limited availability of labeled news datasets.Therefore, the One-Class Learning (OCL) approach, utilizing only a small set of labeled data from the interest class, can be a suitable approach to address this challenge.On the other hand, representing data as a graph enables access to diverse content and structural information, and label propagation methods on graphs can be effective in predicting node labels.In this paper, we adopt a graph-based model for data representation and introduce a semi-supervised and one-class approach for fake news detection, called LOSS-GAT.Initially, we employ a two-step label propagation algorithm, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an initial classifier to categorize news into two groups: interest (fake) and non-interest (real).Subsequently, we enhance the graph structure using structural augmentation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ultimately, we predict the final labels for all unlabeled data using a GNN that induces randomness within the local neighborhood of nodes through the aggregation function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We evaluate our proposed method on five common datasets and compare the results against a set of baseline models, including both OCL and binary labeled models.The results demonstrate that LOSS-GAT achieves a notable improvement, surpassing 10%, with the advantage of utilizing only a limited set of labeled fake news.Noteworthy, LOSS-GAT even outperforms binary labeled models.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer utilizing multilingual LLMs has become a popular learning paradigm for low-resource languages with no labeled training data.However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods.Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues.Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies.This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data.We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages.The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in training Neural Networks to approximate Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) for representing open surfaces in the context of 3D reconstruction.However, UDFs are non-differentiable at the zero level set which leads to significant errors in distances and gradients, generally resulting in fragmented and discontinuous surfaces.In this paper, we propose to learn a hyperbolic scaling of the unsigned distance field, which defines a new Eikonal problem with distinct boundary conditions.This allows our formulation to integrate seamlessly with state-of-the-art continuously differentiable implicit neural representation networks, largely applied in the literature to represent signed distance fields.Our approach not only addresses the challenge of open surface representation but also demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction quality and training performance.Moreover, the unlocked field's differentiability allows the accurate computation of essential topological properties such as normal directions and curvatures, pervasive in downstream tasks such as rendering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we validate our approach across various data sets and against competitive baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate enhanced accuracy and up to an order of magnitude increase in speed compared to previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce and explore the Mirrored Influence Hypothesis, highlighting a reciprocal nature of influence between training and test data.Specifically, it suggests that evaluating the influence of training data on test predictions can be reformulated as an equivalent, yet inverse problem: assessing how the predictions for training samples would be altered if the model were trained on specific test samples.Through both empirical and theoretical validations, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our hypothesis.Inspired by this, we introduce a new method for estimating the influence of training data, which requires calculating gradients for specific test samples, paired with a forward pass for each training point.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach can capitalize on the common asymmetry in scenarios where the number of test samples under concurrent examination is much smaller than the scale of the training dataset, thus gaining a significant improvement in efficiency compared to existing approaches.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We demonstrate the applicability of our method across a range of scenarios, including data attribution in diffusion models, data leakage detection, analysis of memorization, mislabeled data detection, and tracing behavior in language models.Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ruoxi-jia-group/Forward-INF.</p>

                  <p>Bandit convex optimization (BCO) is a general framework for online decision making under uncertainty.While tight regret bounds for general convex losses have been established, existing algorithms achieving these bounds have prohibitive computational costs for high dimensional data.   In this paper, we propose a simple and practical BCO algorithm inspired by the online Newton step algorithm.We show that our algorithm achieves optimal (in terms of horizon) regret bounds for a large class of convex functions that we call $\kappa$-convex.This class contains a wide range of practically relevant loss functions including linear, quadratic, and generalized linear models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to optimal regret, this method is the most efficient known algorithm for several well-studied applications including bandit logistic regression.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Furthermore, we investigate the adaptation of our second-order bandit algorithm to online convex optimization with memory.We show that for loss functions with a certain affine structure, the extended algorithm attains optimal regret.This leads to an algorithm with optimal regret for bandit LQR/LQG problems under a fully adversarial noise model, thereby resolving an open question posed in \citep{gradu2020non} and \citep{sun2023optimal}.   Finally, we show that the more general problem of BCO with (non-affine) memory is harder.We derive a $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ regret lower bound, even under the assumption of smooth and quadratic losses.</p>

                  <p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving.As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges.Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance.However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks.To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity.MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category.(2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions.(3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation.We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data.We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models.The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.Codes and data are available at https://github.com/Eleanor-H/MUSTARD.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for training machine learning models in a decentralized manner while also preserving data privacy.The non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.)nature of client data, coupled with constraints on client or edge devices, presents significant challenges in FL.Furthermore, learning across a high number of communication rounds can be risky and potentially unsafe for model exploitation.Traditional FL approaches may suffer from these challenges.Therefore, we introduce FedSiKD, which incorporates knowledge distillation (KD) within a similarity-based federated learning framework.As clients join the system, they securely share relevant statistics about their data distribution, promoting intra-cluster homogeneity.This enhances optimization efficiency and accelerates the learning process, effectively transferring knowledge between teacher and student models and addressing device constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FedSiKD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, exceeding by 25\% and 18\% for highly skewed data at $\alpha = {0.1,0.5}$ on the HAR and MNIST datasets, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Its faster convergence is illustrated by a 17\% and 20\% increase in accuracy within the first five rounds on the HAR and MNIST datasets, respectively, highlighting its early-stage learning proficiency.Code is publicly available and hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/SimuEnv/FedSiKD)</p>

                  <p>Although deep neural networks yield high classification accuracy given sufficient training data, their predictions are typically overconfident or under-confident, i.e., the prediction confidences cannot truly reflect the accuracy.Post-hoc calibration tackles this problem by calibrating the prediction confidences without re-training the classification model.However, current approaches assume congruence between test and validation data distributions, limiting their applicability to out-of-distribution scenarios.To this end, we propose a novel meta-set-based cascaded temperature regression method for post-hoc calibration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method tailors fine-grained scaling functions to distinct test sets by simulating various domain shifts through data augmentation on the validation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>We partition each meta-set into subgroups based on predicted category and confidence level, capturing diverse uncertainties.A regression network is then trained to derive category-specific and confidence-level-specific scaling, achieving calibration across meta-sets.Extensive experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and TinyImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

                  <p>The knowledge concept recommendation in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a significant issue that has garnered widespread attention.Existing methods primarily rely on the explicit relations between users and knowledge concepts on the MOOC platforms for recommendation.However, there are numerous implicit relations (e.g., shared interests or same knowledge levels between users) generated within the users' learning activities on the MOOC platforms.Existing methods fail to consider these implicit relations, and these relations themselves are difficult to learn and represent, causing poor performance in knowledge concept recommendation and an inability to meet users' personalized needs.To address this issue, we propose a novel framework based on contrastive learning, which can represent and balance the explicit and implicit relations for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs (CL-KCRec).Specifically, we first construct a MOOCs heterogeneous information network (HIN) by modeling the data from the MOOC platforms.Then, we utilize a relation-updated graph convolutional network and stacked multi-channel graph neural network to represent the explicit and implicit relations in the HIN, respectively.Considering that the quantity of explicit relations is relatively fewer compared to implicit relations in MOOCs, we propose a contrastive learning with prototypical graph to enhance the representations of both relations to capture their fruitful inherent relational knowledge, which can guide the propagation of students' preferences within the HIN.Based on these enhanced representations, to ensure the balanced contribution of both towards the final recommendation, we propose a dual-head attention mechanism for balanced fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that CL-KCRec outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets in terms of HR, NDCG and MRR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-step forecasting (MSF) in time-series, the ability to make predictions multiple time steps into the future, is fundamental to almost all temporal domains.To make such forecasts, one must assume the recursive complexity of the temporal dynamics.Such assumptions are referred to as the forecasting strategy used to train a predictive model.Previous work shows that it is not clear which forecasting strategy is optimal a priori to evaluating on unseen data.Furthermore, current approaches to MSF use a single (fixed) forecasting strategy.   In this paper, we characterise the instance-level variance of optimal forecasting strategies and propose Dynamic Strategies (DyStrat) for MSF.We experiment using 10 datasets from different scales, domains, and lengths of multi-step horizons.When using a random-forest-based classifier, DyStrat outperforms the best fixed strategy, which is not knowable a priori, 94% of the time, with an average reduction in mean-squared error of 11%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach typically triples the top-1 accuracy compared to current approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>Notably, we show DyStrat generalises well for any MSF task.</p>

We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We then show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class.   On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps).Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.</p>

                  <p>COVID-19 has affected more than 223 countries worldwide and in the Post-COVID Era, there is a pressing need for non-invasive, low-cost, and highly scalable solutions to detect COVID-19.We develop a deep learning model to identify COVID-19 from voice recording data.The novelty of this work is in the development of deep learning models for COVID-19 identification from only voice recordings.We use the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database which contains 893 speech samples, crowd-sourced from 4352 participants via a COVID-19 Sounds app.Voice features including Mel-spectrograms and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and CNN Encoder features are extracted.Based on the voice data, we develop deep learning classification models to detect COVID-19 cases.These models include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare their predictive power to baseline machine learning models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HuBERT achieves the highest accuracy of 86\% and the highest AUC of 0.93. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>The results achieved with the proposed models suggest promising results in COVID-19 diagnosis from voice recordings when compared to the results obtained from the state-of-the-art.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning is the sequential learning of different tasks by a machine learning model.Continual learning is known to be hindered by catastrophic interference or forgetting, i.e. rapid unlearning of earlier learned tasks when new tasks are learned.Despite their practical success, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are prone to catastrophic interference.This study analyses how gradient descent and overlapping representations between distant input points lead to distal interference and catastrophic interference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Distal interference refers to the phenomenon where training a model on a subset of the domain leads to non-local changes on other subsets of the domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>This study shows that uniformly trainable models without distal interference must be exponentially large.A novel antisymmetric bounded exponential layer B-spline ANN architecture named ABEL-Spline is proposed that can approximate any continuous function, is uniformly trainable, has polynomial computational complexity, and provides some guarantees for distal interference.Experiments are presented to demonstrate the theoretical properties of ABEL-Splines.ABEL-Splines are also evaluated on benchmark regression problems.It is concluded that the weaker distal interference guarantees in ABEL-Splines are insufficient for model-only continual learning.It is conjectured that continual learning with polynomial complexity models requires augmentation of the training data or algorithm.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning is the sequential learning of different tasks by a machine learning model.Continual learning is known to be hindered by catastrophic interference or forgetting, i.e. rapid unlearning of earlier learned tasks when new tasks are learned.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their practical success, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are prone to catastrophic interference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>This study analyses how gradient descent and overlapping representations between distant input points lead to distal interference and catastrophic interference.Distal interference refers to the phenomenon where training a model on a subset of the domain leads to non-local changes on other subsets of the domain.This study shows that uniformly trainable models without distal interference must be exponentially large.A novel antisymmetric bounded exponential layer B-spline ANN architecture named ABEL-Spline is proposed that can approximate any continuous function, is uniformly trainable, has polynomial computational complexity, and provides some guarantees for distal interference.Experiments are presented to demonstrate the theoretical properties of ABEL-Splines.ABEL-Splines are also evaluated on benchmark regression problems.It is concluded that the weaker distal interference guarantees in ABEL-Splines are insufficient for model-only continual learning.It is conjectured that continual learning with polynomial complexity models requires augmentation of the training data or algorithm.</p>

                  <p>The solution of a PDE over varying initial/boundary conditions on multiple domains is needed in a wide variety of applications, but it is computationally expensive if the solution is computed de novo whenever the initial/boundary conditions of the domain change.We introduce a general operator learning framework, called DIffeomorphic Mapping Operator learNing (DIMON) to learn approximate PDE solutions over a family of domains $\{\Omega_{\theta}}_\theta$, that learns the map from initial/boundary conditions and domain $\Omega_\theta$ to the solution of the PDE, or to specified functionals thereof.DIMON is based on transporting a given problem (initial/boundary conditions and domain $\Omega_{\theta}$) to a problem on a reference domain $\Omega_{0}$, where training data from multiple problems is used to learn the map to the solution on $\Omega_{0}$, which is then re-mapped to the original domain $\Omega_{\theta}$. We consider several problems to demonstrate the performance of the framework in learning both static and time-dependent PDEs on non-rigid geometries; these include solving the Laplace equation, reaction-diffusion equations, and a multiscale PDE that characterizes the electrical propagation on the left ventricle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work paves the way toward the fast prediction of PDE solutions on a family of domains and the application of neural operators in engineering and precision medicine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

Empirical evaluations across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trigger detection and detection-evading attack strategy.For trigger detection, our distribution discrepancy-based solution can achieve a 100\% detection rate for the Trojan triggers used in the existing works.For evading trigger detection, our proposed stealthy trigger design approach performs end-to-end learning to make the distribution of poisoned noise input approach that of benign noise, enabling nearly 100\% detection pass rate with very high attack and benign performance for the backdoored diffusion models.</p>

                  <p>Gradient Boost Decision Trees (GBDT) is a powerful additive model based on tree ensembles.Its nature makes GBDT a black-box model even though there are multiple explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models obtaining information by reinterpreting the model globally and locally.Each tree of the ensemble is a transparent model itself but the final outcome is the result of a sum of these trees and it is not easy to clarify.   In this paper, a feature contribution method for GBDT is developed.The proposed method takes advantage of the GBDT architecture to calculate the contribution of each feature using the residue of each node.This algorithm allows to calculate the sequence of node decisions given a prediction.   Theoretical proofs and multiple experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our method which is not only a local explicability model for the GBDT algorithm but also a unique option that reflects GBDTs internal behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposal is aligned to the contribution of characteristics having impact in some artificial intelligence problems such as ethical analysis of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and comply with the new European laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) about the right to explain and nondiscrimination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span></p>

In this paper, we present UR2M, a novel Uncertainty and Resource-aware event detection framework for MCUs.Specifically, we (i) develop an uncertainty-aware WED based on evidential theory for accurate event detection and reliable uncertainty estimation; (ii) introduce a cascade ML framework to achieve efficient model inference via early exits, by sharing shallower model layers among different event models; (iii) optimize the deployment of the model and MCU library for system efficiency.We conducted extensive experiments and compared UR2M to traditional uncertainty baselines using three wearable datasets.Our results demonstrate that UR2M achieves up to 864% faster inference speed, 857% energy-saving for uncertainty estimation, 55% memory saving on two popular MCUs, and a 22% improvement in uncertainty quantification performance.   UR2M can be deployed on a wide range of MCUs, significantly expanding real-time and reliable WED applications.</p>
