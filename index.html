                  <p>Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system.This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR).When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively.However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data.Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs.Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span>The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed.The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.</p>

                  <p>We establish rigorous benchmarks for visual perception robustness.Synthetic images such as ImageNet-C, ImageNet-9, and Stylized ImageNet provide specific type of evaluation over synthetic corruptions, backgrounds, and textures, yet those robustness benchmarks are restricted in specified variations and have low synthetic quality.In this work, we introduce generative model as a data source for synthesizing hard images that benchmark deep models' robustness.Leveraging diffusion models, we are able to generate images with more diversified backgrounds, textures, and materials than any prior work, where we term this benchmark as ImageNet-D. Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models, from the standard ResNet visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4, significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60\%.Our work suggests that diffusion models can be an effective source to test vision models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenshuang-zhang/imagenet_d. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in benchmarking object detectors over the past decade.Like every dataset, COCO contains subtle errors and imperfections stemming from its annotation procedure.With the advent of high-performing models, we ask whether these errors of COCO are hindering its utility in reliably benchmarking further progress.In search for an answer, we inspect thousands of masks from COCO (2017 version) and uncover different types of errors such as imprecise mask boundaries, non-exhaustively annotated instances, and mislabeled masks.Due to the prevalence of COCO, we choose to correct these errors to maintain continuity with prior research.We develop COCO-ReM (Refined Masks), a cleaner set of annotations with visibly better mask quality than COCO-2017.We evaluate fifty object detectors and find that models that predict visually sharper masks score higher on COCO-ReM, affirming that they were being incorrectly penalized due to errors in COCO-2017.Moreover, our models trained using COCO-ReM converge faster and score higher than their larger variants trained using COCO-2017, highlighting the importance of data quality in improving object detectors.With these findings, we advocate using COCO-ReM for future object detection research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is available at https://cocorem.xyz <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.979</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rapid development and widespread application of VR/AR technology, maximizing the quality of immersive panoramic video services that match users' personal preferences and habits has become a long-standing challenge.Understanding the saliency region where users focus, based on data collected with HMDs, can promote multimedia encoding, transmission, and quality assessment.At the same time, large-scale datasets are essential for researchers and developers to explore short/long-term user behavior patterns and train AI models related to panoramic videos.However, existing panoramic video datasets often include low-frequency user head or eye movement data through short-term videos only, lacking sufficient data for analyzing users' Field of View (FoV) and generating video saliency regions.   Driven by these practical factors, in this paper, we present a head and eye tracking dataset involving 50 users (25 males and 25 females) watching 15 panoramic videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset provides details on the viewport and gaze attention locations of users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we present some statistics samples extracted from the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>For example, the deviation between head and eye movements challenges the widely held assumption that gaze attention decreases from the center of the FoV following a Gaussian distribution.Our analysis reveals a consistent downward offset in gaze fixations relative to the FoV in experimental settings involving multiple users and videos.That's why we name the dataset Panonut, a saliency weighting shaped like a donut.Finally, we also provide a script that generates saliency distributions based on given head or eye coordinates and pre-generated saliency distribution map sets of each video from the collected eye tracking data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is available on website: https://dianvrlab.github.io/Panonut360/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.981</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of healthcare, the challenges of copyright protection and unauthorized third-party misuse are increasingly significant.Traditional methods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution, implying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable.This paper introduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the copyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase.DataCook operates by "cooking" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models that perform normally on this processed data.However, during the deployment phase, the original test data must be also "cooked" through DataCook to ensure normal model performance.This process grants copyright holders control over authorization during the deployment phase.The mechanism behind DataCook is by crafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance model confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to confuse models.Similar to Adv, AntiAdv introduces imperceptible perturbations, ensuring that the data processed by DataCook remains easily understandable.We conducted extensive experiments on MedMNIST datasets, encompassing both 2D/3D data and the high-resolution variants.The outcomes indicate that DataCook effectively meets its objectives, preventing models trained on AntiAdv from analyzing unauthorized data effectively, without compromising the validity and accuracy of the data in legitimate scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/MedMNIST/DataCook. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>Digital news platforms use news recommenders as the main instrument to cater to the individual information needs of readers.Despite an increasingly language-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news in multiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major, resource-rich languages, and English in particular.Moreover, nearly all news recommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more and more users tend to consume information in at least two languages.Accordingly, the existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of publicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of news recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual news recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine translation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse languages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>Using xMIND, we systematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural news recommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT) cross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual news consumption patterns.Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even when based on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performance losses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLT training has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual news consumption.Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort in multilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The xMIND dataset is available at https://github.com/andreeaiana/xMIND. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span></p>

                  <p>The short video-sharing services that allow users to post 10-30 second videos (e.g., YouTube Shorts and TikTok) have attracted a lot of attention in recent years.However, conventional video copy detection (VCD) methods mainly focus on general video-sharing services (e.g., YouTube and Bilibili), and the effects of short video-sharing services on video copy detection are still unclear.Considering that illegally copied videos in short video-sharing services have service-distinctive characteristics, especially in those time lengths, the pros and cons of VCD in those services are required to be analyzed.In this paper, we examine the effects of short video-sharing services on VCD by constructing a dataset that has short video-sharing service characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our novel dataset is automatically constructed from the publicly available dataset to have reference videos and fixed short-time-length query videos, and such automation procedures assure the reproducibility and data privacy preservation of this paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>From the experimental results focusing on segment-level and video-level situations, we can see that three effects: "Segment-level VCD in short video-sharing services is more difficult than those in general video-sharing services", "Video-level VCD in short video-sharing services is easier than those in general video-sharing services", "The video alignment component mainly suppress the detection performance in short video-sharing services".</p>

                  <p>As a neuromorphic sensor with high temporal resolution, spike cameras offer notable advantages over traditional cameras in high-speed vision applications such as high-speed optical estimation, depth estimation, and object tracking.Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes.Instead of the multi-view images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time.To reconstruct a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function.We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes generated by blender with the spike camera simulator.Our results demonstrate that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.909</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in learning semantic category discrimination.Despite the remarkable performance of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to the well-annotated data.However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the multimodal scenario.In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges -- enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and \emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval.First, we propose a semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend different modalities and provide precise transport cost.Second, to narrow the discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching.Both of these two components leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate effective cost function.The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.</p>

                  <p>RGB-T tracking, a vital downstream task of object tracking, has made remarkable progress in recent years.Yet, it remains hindered by two major challenges: 1) the trade-off between performance and efficiency; 2) the scarcity of training data.To address the latter challenge, some recent methods employ prompts to fine-tune pre-trained RGB tracking models and leverage upstream knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner.However, these methods inadequately explore modality-independent patterns and disregard the dynamic reliability of different modalities in open scenarios.We propose M3PT, a novel RGB-T prompt tracking method that leverages middle fusion and multi-modal and multi-stage visual prompts to overcome these challenges.We pioneer the use of the middle fusion framework for RGB-T tracking, which achieves a balance between performance and efficiency.Furthermore, we incorporate the pre-trained RGB tracking model into the framework and utilize multiple flexible prompt strategies to adapt the pre-trained model to the comprehensive exploration of uni-modal patterns and the improved modeling of fusion-modal features, harnessing the potential of prompt learning in RGB-T tracking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four challenging benchmarks, while attaining 46.1 fps inference speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Analyzing the behavior of cryptographic functions in stripped binaries is a challenging but essential task.Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection.Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work.In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries.In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoCBinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language.The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches.To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database.In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain.And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions.Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aimed at augmenting recommender systems with recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence.This task has been formulated as a sequence-to-sequence generation process, wherein the input sequence encompasses data pertaining to the user's previously interacted items, and the output sequence denotes the generative identifier for the suggested item.However, existing generative recommendation approaches still encounter challenges in (i) effectively integrating user-item collaborative signals and item content information within a unified generative framework, and (ii) executing an efficient alignment between content information and collaborative signals.   In this paper, we introduce content-based collaborative generation for recommender systems, denoted as ColaRec.To capture collaborative signals, the generative item identifiers are derived from a pretrained collaborative filtering model, while the user is represented through the aggregation of interacted items' content.Subsequently, the aggregated textual description of items is fed into a language model to encapsulate content information.This integration enables ColaRec to amalgamate collaborative signals and content information within an end-to-end framework.Regarding the alignment, we propose an item indexing task to facilitate the mapping between the content-based semantic space and the interaction-based collaborative space.Additionally, a contrastive loss is introduced to ensure that items with similar collaborative GIDs possess comparable content representations, thereby enhancing alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate the efficacy of ColaRec, we conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Empirical results substantiate the superior performance of ColaRec.</p>

                  <p>Descriptive grammars are highly valuable, but writing them is time-consuming and difficult.Furthermore, while linguists typically use corpora to create them, grammar descriptions often lack quantitative data.As for formal grammars, they can be challenging to interpret.In this paper, we propose a new method to extract and explore significant fine-grained grammar patterns and potential syntactic grammar rules from treebanks, in order to create an easy-to-understand corpus-based grammar.More specifically, we extract descriptions and rules across different languages for two linguistic phenomena, agreement and word order, using a large search space and paying special attention to the ranking order of the extracted rules.For that, we use a linear classifier to extract the most salient features that predict the linguistic phenomena under study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We associate statistical information to each rule, and we compare the ranking of the model's results to those of other quantitative and statistical measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Our method captures both well-known and less well-known significant grammar rules in Spanish, French, and Wolof.</p>

                  <p>With the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, how to adapt them to various downstream classification tasks has garnered significant attention in recent research.The adaptation strategies can be typically categorized into three paradigms: zero-shot adaptation, few-shot adaptation, and the recently-proposed training-free few-shot adaptation.Most existing approaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two of these paradigms.In this paper, we introduce a versatile adaptation approach that can effectively work under all three settings.Specifically, we propose the dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components.The static memory caches training data knowledge, enabling training-free few-shot adaptation, while the dynamic memory preserves historical test features online during the testing process, allowing for the exploration of additional data insights beyond the training set.This novel capability enhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability in the absence of training data.The two memory networks employ the same flexible memory interactive strategy, which can operate in a training-free mode and can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers.Our approach is tested across 11 datasets under the three task settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, in the zero-shot scenario, it outperforms existing methods by over 3\% and even shows superior results against methods utilizing external training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Additionally, our method exhibits robust performance against natural distribution shifts.Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/DMN}.</p>

                  <p>To capture user preference, transformer models have been widely applied to model sequential user behavior data.The core of transformer architecture lies in the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scores in a sequence.Due to the permutation-equivariant nature, positional encoding is used to enhance the attention between token representations.In this setting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semantic difference and positional difference.However, prior studies often model the two kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentially limits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling.To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention, named EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulate both semantic difference and positional difference.The EulerFormer involves two key technical improvements.First, it employs a new transformation function for efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complex vectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semantic and positional information in a complex rotation form.Secondly, it develops a differential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can be controlled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of the semantic and positional information according to the semantic contexts.Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improve the anisotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer.Our theoretical framework possesses a high degree of completeness and generality.It is more robust to semantic variations and possesses moresuperior theoretical properties in principle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) leveraging transformers has achieved great success on the interpretation of complex visual-language tasks.However, the quadratic computation cost makes it resource-consuming in capturing long-range visual-language dependencies.Fortunately, Mamba addresses this with efficient linear complexity in processing.However, directly applying Mamba to multi-modal interactions presents challenges, primarily due to inadequate channel interactions for the effective fusion of multi-modal data.In this paper, we propose ReMamber, a novel RIS architecture that integrates the power of Mamba with a multi-modal Mamba Twister block.The Mamba Twister explicitly models image-text interaction, and fuses textual and visual features through its unique channel and spatial twisting mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We achieve the state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>Moreover, we conduct thorough analyses of ReMamber and discuss other fusion designs using Mamba.These provide valuable perspectives for future research.</p>

                  <p>Gestures play a key role in human communication.Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation, while managing to generate beat-aligned motions, struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance.Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal, semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion, and can be controlled by focusing on certain words.Therefore, we present ConvoFusion, a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis, which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs, but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis.Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing.Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures.To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures, the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released, which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video at our website.</p>

                  <p>Code revert prediction, a specialized form of software defect detection, aims to forecast or predict the likelihood of code changes being reverted or rolled back in software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This task is very important in practice because by identifying code changes that are more prone to being reverted, developers and project managers can proactively take measures to prevent issues, improve code quality, and optimize development processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>However, compared to code defect detection, code revert prediction has been rarely studied in previous research.Additionally, many previous methods for code defect detection relied on independent features but ignored relationships between code scripts.Moreover, new challenges are introduced due to constraints in an industry setting such as company regulation, limited features and large-scale codebase.To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a systematic empirical study for code revert prediction that integrates the code import graph with code features.Different strategies to address anomalies and data imbalance have been implemented including graph neural networks with imbalance classification and anomaly detection.We conduct the experiments on real-world code commit data within J.P. Morgan Chase which is extremely imbalanced in order to make a comprehensive comparison of these different approaches for the code revert prediction problem.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural network models have demonstrated their effectiveness in classifying multi-label data from various domains.Typically, they employ a training mode that combines mini-batches with optimizers, where each sample is randomly selected with equal probability when constructing mini-batches.However, the intrinsic class imbalance in multi-label data may bias the model towards majority labels, since samples relevant to minority labels may be underrepresented in each mini-batch.Meanwhile, during the training process, we observe that instances associated with minority labels tend to induce greater losses.Existing heuristic batch selection methods, such as priority selection of samples with high contribution to the objective function, i.e., samples with high loss, have been proven to accelerate convergence while reducing the loss and test error in single-label data.However, batch selection methods have not yet been applied and validated in multi-label data.In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective adaptive batch selection algorithm tailored to multi-label deep learning models.It adaptively selects each batch by prioritizing hard samples related to minority labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A variant of our method also takes informative label correlations into consideration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Comprehensive experiments combining five multi-label deep learning models on thirteen benchmark datasets show that our method converges faster and performs better than random batch selection.</p>

                  <p>The literature on text-to-image generation is plagued by issues of faithfully composing entities with relations.But there lacks a formal understanding of how entity-relation compositions can be effectively learned.Moreover, the underlying phenomenon space that meaningfully reflects the problem structure is not well-defined, leading to an arms race for larger quantities of data in the hope that generalization emerges out of large-scale pretraining.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hypothesize that the underlying phenomenological coverage has not been proportionally scaled up, leading to a skew of the presented phenomenon which harms generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>We introduce statistical metrics that quantify both the linguistic and visual skew of a dataset for relational learning, and show that generalization failures of text-to-image generation are a direct result of incomplete or unbalanced phenomenological coverage.We first perform experiments in a synthetic domain and demonstrate that systematically controlled metrics are strongly predictive of generalization performance.Then we move to natural images and show that simple distribution perturbations in light of our theories boost generalization without enlarging the absolute data size.This work informs an important direction towards quality-enhancing the data diversity or balance orthogonal to scaling up the absolute size.Our discussions point out important open questions on 1) Evaluation of generated entity-relation compositions, and 2) Better models for reasoning with abstract relations.</p>

                  <p>Human motion prediction is consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences.It is a longstanding challenge due to motion's complex dynamics and uncertainty.Existing methods focus on building up complicated neural networks to model the motion dynamics.The predicted results are required to be strictly similar to the training samples with L2 loss in current training pipeline.However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty property which is crucial to the prediction task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that the recorded motion in training data could be an observation of possible future, rather than a predetermined result. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>In addition, existing works calculate the predicted error on each future frame equally during training, while recent work indicated that different frames could play different roles.In this work, a novel computationally efficient encoder-decoder model with uncertainty consideration is proposed, which could learn proper characteristics for future frames by a dynamic function.Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our uncertainty consideration approach has obvious advantages both in quantity and quality.Moreover, the proposed method could produce motion sequences with much better quality that avoids the intractable shaking artefacts.We believe our work could provide a novel perspective to consider the uncertainty quality for the general motion prediction task and encourage the studies in this field.The code will be available in https://github.com/Motionpre/Adaptive-Salient-Loss-SAGGB.</p>

On the other hand, using large base objects, we give a strong possibility result in the form of a universal construction: an object with $s$ possible states can be implemented in a wait-free, history-independent manner from compare-and-swap base objects that each have $O(s + 2^n)$ possible memory states, where $n$ is the number of processes in the system.</p>

                  <p>Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing.Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data.With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities.However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset.Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation.In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space.Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency.Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns.Our implementation is available at https://github.com/WAL-l/SeisFusion.</p>

                  <p>Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image processing.These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry.However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many challenges have emerged.This thesis presents various approaches that address robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.   Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before certification and deployment in practice.Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the adversarial attack literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, building trust in AI-based models requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that are more explainable and interpretable a priori.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and explainability.Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in the related research.Besides methodological developments for robust and explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and improving their design and robustness.In addition to the theoretical developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.</p>

                  <p>The continual expansion of software size and complexity has led to an increased focus on reducing defects and bugs during development.Although Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) offer help, in practice, the significant number of false positives can impede developers' productivity and confidence in the tools.Therefore, previous research efforts have explored learning-based methods to validate the reported warnings.Nevertheless, there are still some limitations.(1) The granularity of prior research is coarse, as it focuses on identifying either actionable warnings throughout extensive development histories or potential true warnings at the function level.These approaches lack specificity regarding individual bugs and warnings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Machine learning-based approaches need much manual effort for feature engineering while existing deep learning-based approaches ignore key semantics between source code and warnings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>(3) The small number of selected projects hinders the comprehensive evaluation of these approaches.In this paper, we proposed a fine-grained warning verification approach that is sensitive to bugs for improving the results of ASATs, namely \ourtool.Specifically, we design a novel LSTM-based model that captures both fine-grained semantics of source code and warnings from ASATs and highlights their correlations with cross-attention.To tackle the data scarcity of training and evaluation, we collected a large-scale dataset of 280,273 warnings, namely FineWA.It is ten times larger than the existing largest dataset.Then, we conducted extensive experiments on the dataset to evaluate FineWAVE.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with an F1-score of 97.79% for reducing false alarms and 67.06% for confirming actual warnings, which also significantly outperforms all baselines.</p>

                  <p>We consider an online strategic classification problem where each arriving agent can manipulate their true feature vector to obtain a positive predicted label, while incurring a cost that depends on the amount of manipulation.The learner seeks to predict the agent's true label given access to only the manipulated features.After the learner releases their prediction, the agent's true label is revealed.Previous algorithms such as the strategic perceptron guarantee finitely many mistakes under a margin assumption on agents' true feature vectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, these are not guaranteed to encourage agents to be truthful. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Promoting truthfulness is intimately linked to obtaining adequate margin on the predictions, thus we provide two new algorithms aimed at recovering the maximum margin classifier in the presence of strategic agent behavior.We prove convergence, finite mistake and finite manipulation guarantees for a variety of agent cost structures.We also provide generalized versions of the strategic perceptron with mistake guarantees for different costs.Our numerical study on real and synthetic data demonstrates that the new algorithms outperform previous ones in terms of margin, number of manipulation and number of mistakes.</p>

                  <p>A well-designed document communicates not only through its words but also through its visual eloquence.Authors utilize aesthetic elements such as colors, fonts, graphics, and layouts to shape the perception of information.Thoughtful document design, informed by psychological insights, enhances both the visual appeal and the comprehension of the content.While state-of-the-art document AI models demonstrate the benefits of incorporating layout and image data, it remains unclear whether the nuances of document aesthetics are effectively captured.To bridge the gap between human cognition and AI interpretation of aesthetic elements, we formulated hypotheses concerning AI behavior in document understanding tasks, specifically anchored in document design principles.With a focus on legibility and layout quality, we tested four aspects of aesthetic effects: noise, font-size contrast, alignment, and complexity, on model confidence using correlational analysis.The results and observations highlight the value of model analysis rooted in document design theories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work serves as a trailhead for further studies and we advocate for continued research in this topic to deepen our understanding of how AI interprets document aesthetics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, including GitHub Copilot, OpenAI GPT, and Stable Diffusion, has revolutionized content creation, enabling non-professionals to produce high-quality content across various domains.This transformative technology has led to a surge of synthetic content and sparked legal disputes over copyright infringement.To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the learning capacity of GenAI models for copyright legal analysis, demonstrated with GPT2 and Stable Diffusion models.Copyright law distinguishes between original expressions and generic ones (Sc\`enes \`a faire), protecting the former and permitting reproduction of the latter.However, this distinction has historically been challenging to make consistently, leading to over-protection of copyrighted works.GenAI offers an unprecedented opportunity to enhance this legal analysis by revealing shared patterns in preexisting works.We propose a data-driven approach to identify the genericity of works created by GenAI, employing "data-driven bias" to assess the genericity of expressive compositions.This approach aids in copyright scope determination by utilizing the capabilities of GenAI to identify and prioritize expressive elements and rank them according to their frequency in the model's dataset.The potential implications of measuring expressive genericity for copyright law are profound.Such scoring could assist courts in determining copyright scope during litigation, inform the registration practices of Copyright Offices, allowing registration of only highly original synthetic works, and help copyright owners signal the value of their works and facilitate fairer licensing deals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More generally, this approach offers valuable insights to policymakers grappling with adapting copyright law to the challenges posed by the era of GenAI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>
