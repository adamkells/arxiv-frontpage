                  <p>This work demonstrates that substantial gains in zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) accuracy can be achieved by increasing the diversity of training data using synthetic data generation techniques.Current DST training resources are severely limited in the number of application domains and slot types they cover due to the high costs of data collection, resulting in limited adaptability to new domains.The presented work overcomes this challenge using a novel, fully automatic data generation approach to create synthetic zero-shot DST training resources.Unlike previous approaches for generating DST data, the presented approach generates entirely new application domains to generate dialogues, complete with silver dialogue state annotations and slot descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach is used to create the D0T dataset for training zero-shot DST models, which covers an unprecedented 1,000+ domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Experiments performed on the MultiWOZ benchmark indicate that training models on diverse synthetic data yields a performance improvement of +6.7% Joint Goal Accuracy, achieving results competitive with much larger models.</p>

                  <p>Enterprise security is increasingly being threatened by social engineering attacks, such as phishing, which deceive employees into giving access to enterprise data.To protect both the users themselves and enterprise data, more and more organizations provide cyber security training that seeks to teach employees/customers to identify and report suspicious content.By its very nature, such training seeks to focus on signals that are likely to persist across a wide range of attacks.Further, it expects the user to apply the learnings from these training on e-mail messages that were not filtered by existing, automatic enterprise security (e.g., spam filters and commercial phishing detection software).However, relying on such training now shifts the detection of phishing from an automatic process to a human driven one which is fallible especially when a user errs due to distraction, forgetfulness, etc.In this work we explore treating this type of detection as a natural language processing task and modifying training pipelines accordingly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a dataset with annotated labels where these labels are created from the classes of signals that users are typically asked to identify in such training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>We also present baseline classifier models trained on these classes of labels.With a comparative analysis of performance between human annotators and the models on these labels, we provide insights which can contribute to the improvement of the respective curricula for both machine and human training.</p>

                  <p>In the animation industry, 3D modelers typically rely on front and back non-overlapped concept designs to guide the 3D modeling of anime characters.However, there is currently a lack of automated approaches for generating anime characters directly from these 2D designs.In light of this, we explore a novel task of reconstructing anime characters from non-overlapped views.This presents two main challenges: existing multi-view approaches cannot be directly applied due to the absence of overlapping regions, and there is a scarcity of full-body anime character data and standard benchmarks.To bridge the gap, we present Non-Overlapped Views for 3D \textbf{A}nime Character Reconstruction (NOVA-3D), a new framework that implements a method for view-aware feature fusion to learn 3D-consistent features effectively and synthesizes full-body anime characters from non-overlapped front and back views directly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate this line of research, we collected the NOVA-Human dataset, which comprises multi-view images and accurate camera parameters for 3D anime characters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches, achieving superior reconstruction of anime characters with exceptional detail fidelity.In addition, to further verify the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to the animation head reconstruction task and improved the state-of-the-art baseline to 94.453 in SSIM, 7.726 in LPIPS, and 19.575 in PSNR on average.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Codes and datasets are available at https://wanghongsheng01.github.io/NOVA-3D/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span></p>

                  <p>Discovering the semantics of multimodal utterances is essential for understanding human language and enhancing human-machine interactions.Existing methods manifest limitations in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios.This paper introduces a novel unsupervised multimodal clustering method (UMC), making a pioneering contribution to this field.UMC introduces a unique approach to constructing augmentation views for multimodal data, which are then used to perform pre-training to establish well-initialized representations for subsequent clustering.An innovative strategy is proposed to dynamically select high-quality samples as guidance for representation learning, gauged by the density of each sample's nearest neighbors.Besides, it is equipped to automatically determine the optimal value for the top-$K$ parameter in each cluster to refine sample selection.Finally, both high- and low-quality samples are used to learn representations conducive to effective clustering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build baselines on benchmark multimodal intent and dialogue act datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>UMC shows remarkable improvements of 2-6\% scores in clustering metrics over state-of-the-art methods, marking the first successful endeavor in this domain.The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/thuiar/UMC.</p>

                  <p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems face challenges in handling complex processes and diverse screen layouts that require advanced human-like decision-making capabilities.These systems typically rely on pixel-level encoding through drag-and-drop or automation frameworks such as Selenium to create navigation workflows, rather than visual understanding of screen elements.In this context, we present SmartFlow, an AI-based RPA system that uses pre-trained large language models (LLMs) coupled with deep-learning based image understanding.Our system can adapt to new scenarios, including changes in the user interface and variations in input data, without the need for human intervention.SmartFlow uses computer vision and natural language processing to perceive visible elements on the graphical user interface (GUI) and convert them into a textual representation.This information is then utilized by LLMs to generate a sequence of actions that are executed by a scripting engine to complete an assigned task.To assess the effectiveness of SmartFlow, we have developed a dataset that includes a set of generic enterprise applications with diverse layouts, which we are releasing for research use.Our evaluations on this dataset demonstrate that SmartFlow exhibits robustness across different layouts and applications.SmartFlow can automate a wide range of business processes such as form filling, customer service, invoice processing, and back-office operations.SmartFlow can thus assist organizations in enhancing productivity by automating an even larger fraction of screen-based workflows.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demo-video and dataset are available at https://smartflow-4c5a0a.webflow.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.908</span></span></p>

                  <p>Constructing simulation scenes that are both visually and physically realistic is a problem of practical interest in domains ranging from robotics to computer vision.This problem has become even more relevant as researchers wielding large data-hungry learning methods seek new sources of training data for physical decision-making systems.However, building simulation models is often still done by hand.A graphic designer and a simulation engineer work with predefined assets to construct rich scenes with realistic dynamic and kinematic properties.While this may scale to small numbers of scenes, to achieve the generalization properties that are required for data-driven robotic control, we require a pipeline that is able to synthesize large numbers of realistic scenes, complete with 'natural' kinematic and dynamic structures.To attack this problem, we develop models for inferring structure and generating simulation scenes from natural images, allowing for scalable scene generation from web-scale datasets.To train these image-to-simulation models, we show how controllable text-to-image generative models can be used in generating paired training data that allows for modeling of the inverse problem, mapping from realistic images back to complete scene models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show how this paradigm allows us to build large datasets of scenes in simulation with semantic and physical realism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.887</span></span>We present an integrated end-to-end pipeline that generates simulation scenes complete with articulated kinematic and dynamic structures from real-world images and use these for training robotic control policies.We then robustly deploy in the real world for tasks like articulated object manipulation.In doing so, our work provides both a pipeline for large-scale generation of simulation environments and an integrated system for training robust robotic control policies in the resulting environments.</p>

                  <p>Classifying public tenders is a useful task for both companies that are invited to participate and for inspecting fraudulent activities.To facilitate the task for both participants and public administrations, the European Union presented a common taxonomy (\textit{Common Procurement Vocabulary}, CPV) which is mandatory for tenders of certain importance; however, the contracts in which a CPV label is mandatory are the minority compared to all the Public Administrations activities.Classifying over a real-world taxonomy introduces some difficulties that can not be ignored.First of all, some fine-grained classes have an insufficient (if any) number of observations in the training set, while other classes are far more frequent (even thousands of times) than the average.To overcome those difficulties, we present a zero-shot approach, based on a pre-trained language model that relies only on label description and respects the label taxonomy.To train our proposed model, we used industrial data, which comes from \url{contrattipubblici.org}, a service by \href{https://spaziodati.eu}{SpazioDati s.r.l}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>that collects public contracts stipulated in Italy in the last 25 years. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Results show that the proposed model achieves better performance in classifying low-frequent classes compared to three different baselines, and is also able to predict never-seen classes.</p>

                  <p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation.SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions.The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications.Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods.This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor.A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images.Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X.

                  <p>A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate.Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set.Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30.Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set.In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias.Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets.Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.</p>

For some values of $t$, however, no algorithm can reach the optimal (information-theoretic) bound on the number of comparators.For this case (and any other $n$ and $t$), we show an algorithm that uses at most three times as many comparators as the theoretical bound.   We also design a randomized Las-Vegas two-rounds sorting algorithm for any $n$ and $t$. Our algorithm uses an asymptotically optimal number of $O(\max(\frac{n^{3/2}}{t^2},\frac{n}{t}))$ comparators, with high probability, i.e., with probability at least $1-1/n$. The analysis of this algorithm involves the gradual unveiling of randomness, using a novel technique which we coin the binary tree of deferred randomness.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) is a critical training phase for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).With the improving capabilities of open-source LVLMs, researchers have increasingly turned to generate VLIT data by using open-source LVLMs and achieved significant progress.However, such data generation approaches are bottlenecked by the following challenges: 1) Since multi-modal models tend to be influenced by prior language knowledge, directly using LVLMs to generate VLIT data would inevitably lead to low content relevance between generated data and images.2) To improve the ability of the models to generate VLIT data, previous methods have incorporated an additional training phase to boost the generative capacity.This process hurts the generalization of the models to unseen inputs (i.e., "exposure bias" problem).In this paper, we propose a new Content Correlated VLIT data generation via Contrastive Learning (C3L).Specifically, we design a new content relevance module which enhances the content relevance between VLIT data and images by computing Image Instruction Correspondence Scores S(I2C).Moreover, a contrastive learning module is introduced to further boost the VLIT data generation capability of the LVLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A large number of automatic measures on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multispectral pedestrian detection has been shown to be effective in improving performance within complex illumination scenarios.However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch.This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems.To address this limitation, various knowledge distillation methods have been proposed.However, traditional distillation methods focus only on the fusion features and ignore the large amount of information in the original multi-modal features, thereby restricting the student network's performance.To tackle the challenge, we introduce the Adaptive Modal Fusion Distillation (AMFD) framework, which can fully utilize the original modal features of the teacher network.Specifically, a Modal Extraction Alignment (MEA) module is utilized to derive learning weights for student networks, integrating focal and global attention mechanisms.This methodology enables the student network to acquire optimal fusion strategies independent from that of teacher network without necessitating an additional feature fusion module.Furthermore, we present the SMOD dataset, a well-aligned challenging multispectral dataset for detection.Extensive experiments on the challenging KAIST, LLVIP and SMOD datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AMFD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reducing log-average Miss Rate and improving mean Average Precision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/bigD233/AMFD.git.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning (CL) aims to extend deep models from static and enclosed environments to dynamic and complex scenarios, enabling systems to continuously acquire new knowledge of novel categories without forgetting previously learned knowledge.Recent CL models have gradually shifted towards the utilization of pre-trained models (PTMs) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies.However, continual fine-tuning still presents a serious challenge of catastrophic forgetting due to the absence of previous task data.Additionally, the fine-tune-then-frozen mechanism suffers from performance limitations due to feature channels suppression and insufficient training data in the first CL task.To this end, this paper proposes feature transformation tuning (FeTT) model to non-parametrically fine-tune backbone features across all tasks, which not only operates independently of CL training data but also smooths feature channels to prevent excessive suppression.Then, the extended ensemble strategy incorporating different PTMs with FeTT model facilitates further performance improvement.We further elaborate on the discussions of the fine-tune-then-frozen paradigm and the FeTT model from the perspectives of discrepancy in class marginal distributions and feature channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on CL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.933</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph Transformers (GTs) such as SAN and GPS are graph processing models that combine Message-Passing GNNs (MPGNNs) with global Self-Attention.They were shown to be universal function approximators, with two reservations:1.The initial node features must be augmented with certain positional encodings.2.The approximation is non-uniform: Graphs of different sizes may require a different approximating network.   We first clarify that this form of universality is not unique to GTs: Using the same positional encodings, also pure MPGNNs and even 2-layer MLPs are non-uniform universal approximators.We then consider uniform expressivity: The target function is to be approximated by a single network for graphs of all sizes.There, we compare GTs to the more efficient MPGNN + Virtual Node architecture.The essential difference between the two model definitions is in their global computation method -- Self-Attention Vs Virtual Node.We prove that none of the models is a uniform-universal approximator, before proving our main result: Neither model's uniform expressivity subsumes the other's.We demonstrate the theory with experiments on synthetic data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further augment our study with real-world datasets, observing mixed results which indicate no clear ranking in practice as well. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection in chest X-rays is a critical task.Most methods mainly model the distribution of normal images, and then regard significant deviation from normal distribution as anomaly.Recently, CLIP-based methods, pre-trained on a large number of medical images, have shown impressive performance on zero/few-shot downstream tasks.In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of CLIP-based methods for anomaly detection in chest X-rays.Considering the discrepancy between the CLIP pre-training data and the task-specific data, we propose a position-guided prompt learning method.Specifically, inspired by the fact that experts diagnose chest X-rays by carefully examining distinct lung regions, we propose learnable position-guided text and image prompts to adapt the task data to the frozen pre-trained CLIP-based model.To enhance the model's discriminative capability, we propose a novel structure-preserving anomaly synthesis method within chest x-rays during the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>The code of our implementation is available at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/PPAD.</p>

                  <p>Recently, ray tracing has gained renewed interest with the advent of Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology, a key enabler of 6G wireless communications due to its capability of intelligent manipulation of electromagnetic waves.However, accurately modeling RIS-enabled wireless environments poses significant challenges due to the complex variations caused by various environmental factors and the mobility of RISs.In this paper, we propose a novel modeling approach using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to characterize the dynamics of electromagnetic fields in such environments.Our method utilizes NeRF-based ray tracing to intuitively capture and visualize the complex dynamics of signal propagation, effectively modeling the complete signal pathways from the transmitter to the RIS, and from the RIS to the receiver.This two-stage process accurately characterizes multiple complex transmission paths, enhancing our understanding of signal behavior in real-world scenarios.Our approach predicts the signal field for any specified RIS placement and receiver location, facilitating efficient RIS deployment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations using both simulated and real-world data validate the significant benefits of our methodology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span></p>

                  <p>A fundamental building block in any graph algorithm is a graph container - a data structure used to represent the graph.Ideally, a graph container enables efficient access to the underlying graph, has low space usage, and supports updating the graph efficiently.In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of graph containers designed to support running algorithms on large graphs.To our knowledge, this is the first apples-to-apples comparison of graph containers rather than overall systems, which include confounding factors such as differences in algorithm implementations and infrastructure.   We measure the running time of 10 highly-optimized algorithms across over 20 different containers and 10 graphs.Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the average algorithm running time does not differ much across containers, especially those that support dynamic updates.Specifically, a simple container based on an off-the-shelf B-tree is only 1.22x slower on average than a highly optimized static one.Moreover, we observe that simplifying a graph-container Application Programming Interface (API) to only a few simple functions incurs a mere 1.16x slowdown compared to a complete API.Finally, we also measure batch-insert throughput in dynamic-graph containers for a full picture of their performance.   To perform the benchmarks, we introduce BYO, a unified framework that standardizes evaluations of graph-algorithm performance across different graph containers.BYO extends the Graph Based Benchmark Suite (Dhulipala et al. 18), a state-of-the-art graph algorithm benchmark, to easily plug into different dynamic graph containers and enable fair comparisons between them on a large suite of graph algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While several graph algorithm benchmarks have been developed to date, to the best of our knowledge, BYO is the first system designed to benchmark graph containers <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) is a latent variable modeling technique commonly used to identify smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories underlying high-dimensional neural recordings.Specifically, researchers model spiking rates as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference.Recently, GPFA has been extended to model spike count data.However, due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood, the inference becomes intractable.Prior works rely on either black-box inference techniques, numerical integration or polynomial approximations of the likelihood to handle intractability.To overcome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate Gaussian process factor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally tractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data.In particular, we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the model conditionally conjugate.Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of simple closed-form updates using a variational EM algorithm.Furthermore, due to its conditional conjugacy, we show our model can be readily scaled using sparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated inference via natural gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our method, we empirically demonstrate its efficacy through experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span></p>

Conclusion: Our study indicates the effectiveness of reducing ranking errors for classifier-based effort-aware defect prediction.We recommend using EA-Z with imbalanced ensemble learning.</p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>

                  <p>In probabilistic updating one transforms a prior distribution in the light of given evidence into a posterior distribution, via what is called conditioning, updating, belief revision or inference.This is the essence of learning, as Bayesian updating.It will be illustrated via a physical model involving (adapted) water flows through pipes with different diameters.   Bayesian updating makes us wiser, in the sense that the posterior distribution makes the evidence more likely than the prior, since it incorporates the evidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Things are less clear when one wishes to learn from multiple pieces of evidence / data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.561</span></span>It turns out that there are (at least) two forms of updating for this, associated with Jeffrey and Pearl.The difference is not always clearly recognised.   This paper provides an introduction and an overview in the setting of discrete probability theory.It starts from an elementary question, involving multiple pieces of evidence, that has been sent to a small group academic specialists.Their answers show considerable differences.This is used as motivation and starting point to introduce the two forms of updating, of Jeffrey and Pearl, for multiple inputs and to elaborate their properties.In the end the account is related to so-called variational free energy (VFE) update in the cognitive theory of predictive processing.It is shown that both Jeffrey and Pearl outperform VFE updating and that VFE updating need not decrease divergence - that is correct errors - as it is supposed to do.</p>

                  <p>Instance segmentation is data-hungry, and as model capacity increases, data scale becomes crucial for improving the accuracy.Most instance segmentation datasets today require costly manual annotation, limiting their data scale.Models trained on such data are prone to overfitting on the training set, especially for those rare categories.While recent works have delved into exploiting generative models to create synthetic datasets for data augmentation, these approaches do not efficiently harness the full potential of generative models.   To address these issues, we introduce a more efficient strategy to construct generative datasets for data augmentation, termed DiverGen.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, we provide an explanation of the role of generative data from the perspective of distribution discrepancy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>We investigate the impact of different data on the distribution learned by the model.We argue that generative data can expand the data distribution that the model can learn, thus mitigating overfitting.Additionally, we find that the diversity of generative data is crucial for improving model performance and enhance it through various strategies, including category diversity, prompt diversity, and generative model diversity.With these strategies, we can scale the data to millions while maintaining the trend of model performance improvement.On the LVIS dataset, DiverGen significantly outperforms the strong model X-Paste, achieving +1.1 box AP and +1.1 mask AP across all categories, and +1.9 box AP and +2.5 mask AP for rare categories.</p>

                  <p>It seems that in the current age, computers, computation, and data have an increasingly important role to play in scientific research and discovery.This is reflected in part by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have become great areas of interest not just for computer science but also for many other fields of study.More generally, there have been trends moving towards the use of bigger, more complex and higher capacity models.It also seems that stochastic models, and stochastic variants of existing deterministic models, have become important research directions in various fields.For all of these types of models, gradient-based optimization remains as the dominant paradigm for model fitting, control, and more.This dissertation considers unconstrained, nonlinear optimization problems, with a focus on the gradient itself, that key quantity which enables the solution of such problems.   In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of reverse differentiation, a term which describes the body of techniques which enables the efficient computation of gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We cover relevant techniques both in the deterministic and stochastic cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We present a new framework for calculating the gradient of problems which involve both deterministic and stochastic elements.In chapter 2, we analyze the properties of the gradient estimator, with a focus on those properties which are typically assumed in convergence proofs of optimization algorithms.Chapter 3 gives various examples of applying our new gradient estimator.We further explore the idea of working with piecewise continuous models, that is, models with distinct branches and if statements which define what specific branch to use.</p>

                  <p>The alarming decline in global biodiversity, driven by various factors, underscores the urgent need for large-scale wildlife monitoring.In response, scientists have turned to automated deep learning methods for data processing in wildlife monitoring.However, applying these advanced methods in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their complexity and the need for specialized knowledge, primarily because of technical challenges and interdisciplinary barriers.   To address these challenges, we introduce Pytorch-Wildlife, an open-source deep learning platform built on PyTorch.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is designed for creating, modifying, and sharing powerful AI models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>This platform emphasizes usability and accessibility, making it accessible to individuals with limited or no technical background.It also offers a modular codebase to simplify feature expansion and further development.Pytorch-Wildlife offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface, accessible through local installation or Hugging Face, for animal detection and classification in images and videos.As two real-world applications, Pytorch-Wildlife has been utilized to train animal classification models for species recognition in the Amazon Rainforest and for invasive opossum recognition in the Galapagos Islands.The Opossum model achieves 98% accuracy, and the Amazon model has 92% recognition accuracy for 36 animals in 90% of the data.As Pytorch-Wildlife evolves, we aim to integrate more conservation tasks, addressing various environmental challenges.Pytorch-Wildlife is available at https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large-scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed.It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process.The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation.It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation.The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making.Our contributions are two folder.First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection.Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations.The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval.For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight.</p>

                  <p>Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques.However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance.In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases.Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results.To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs.In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images.This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization.Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely.The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively.This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks.It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.591</span></span></p>

In this study, we explore optimization games, in which the value of the characteristic function is provided as the optimal value of an optimization problem.To assess the robustness of the allocation methods, we use the Lipschitz constant, which quantifies the extent of change in the allocation vector in response to a unit perturbation in the weight vector of the underlying problem.Thereafter, we provide an algorithm for the matching game that returns an allocation belonging to the $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon\right)$-approximate core with Lipschitz constant $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Additionally, we provide an algorithm for a minimum spanning tree game that returns an allocation belonging to the $4$-approximate core with a constant Lipschitz constant.   The Shapley value is a popular allocation that satisfies several desirable properties.Therefore, we investigate the robustness of the Shapley value.We demonstrate that the Lipschitz constant of the Shapley value for the minimum spanning tree is constant, whereas that for the matching game is $\Omega(\log n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices.</p>
