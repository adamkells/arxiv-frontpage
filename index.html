                  <p>Time series data has been demonstrated to be crucial in various research fields.The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network.Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem.This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification.However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain.In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task.Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains.Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms other baselines and learns a condensed synthetic dataset that exhibits desirable characteristics such as conforming to the distribution of the original data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) proficiently allows an agent to tackle novel tasks while solely relying on a static dataset.For precise and efficient task identification, existing OMRL research suggests learning separate task representations that be incorporated with policy input, thus forming a context-based meta-policy.A major approach to train task representations is to adopt contrastive learning using multi-task offline data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset typically encompasses interactions from various policies (i.e., the behavior policies), thus providing a plethora of contextual information regarding different tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Nonetheless, amassing data from a substantial number of policies is not only impractical but also often unattainable in realistic settings.Instead, we resort to a more constrained yet practical scenario, where multi-task data collection occurs with a limited number of policies.We observed that learned task representations from previous OMRL methods tend to correlate spuriously with the behavior policy instead of reflecting the essential characteristics of the task, resulting in unfavorable out-of-distribution generalization.To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm to disentangle the impact of behavior policy from task representation learning through a process called adversarial data augmentation.Specifically, the objective of adversarial data augmentation is not merely to generate data analogous to offline data distribution; instead, it aims to create adversarial examples designed to confound learned task representations and lead to incorrect task identification.Our experiments show that learning from such adversarial samples significantly enhances the robustness and effectiveness of the task identification process and realizes satisfactory out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

                  <p>Scene text recognition is an important and challenging task in computer vision.However, most prior works focus on recognizing pre-defined words, while there are various out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in real-world applications.   In this paper, we propose a novel open-vocabulary text recognition framework, Pseudo-OCR, to recognize OOV words.The key challenge in this task is the lack of OOV training data.To solve this problem, we first propose a pseudo label generation module that leverages character detection and image inpainting to produce substantial pseudo OOV training data from real-world images.Unlike previous synthetic data, our pseudo OOV data contains real characters and backgrounds to simulate real-world applications.Secondly, to reduce noises in pseudo data, we present a semantic checking mechanism to filter semantically meaningful data.Thirdly, we introduce a quality-aware margin loss to boost the training with pseudo data.Our loss includes a margin-based part to enhance the classification ability, and a quality-aware part to penalize low-quality samples in both real and pseudo data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on eight datasets and achieves the first rank in the ICDAR2022 challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) refers to a form of technical debt in which developers explicitly acknowledge and document the existence of technical shortcuts, workarounds, or temporary solutions within the codebase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Over recent years, researchers have manually labeled datasets derived from various software development artifacts: source code comments, messages from the issue tracker and pull request sections, and commit messages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span>These datasets are designed for training, evaluation, performance validation, and improvement of machine learning and deep learning models to accurately identify SATD instances.However, class imbalance poses a serious challenge across all the existing datasets, particularly when researchers are interested in categorizing the specific types of SATD.In order to address the scarcity of labeled data for SATD \textit{identification} (i.e., whether an instance is SATD or not) and \textit{categorization} (i.e., which type of SATD is being classified) in existing datasets, we share the \textit{SATDAUG} dataset, an augmented version of existing SATD datasets, including source code comments, issue tracker, pull requests, and commit messages.These augmented datasets have been balanced in relation to the available artifacts and provide a much richer source of labeled data for training machine learning or deep learning models.</p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough results, opening countless new possibilities for many practical applications.However, LLMs lack elementary safety features that are established norms in other areas of computer science, such as the separation between instructions and data, causing them to malfunction or rendering them vulnerable to manipulation and interference by third parties e.g., via indirect prompt/command injection.Even worse, so far, there is not even an established definition of what precisely such a separation would mean and how its violation could be tested.In this work, we aim to close this gap.We introduce a formal measure to quantify the phenomenon of instruction-data separation as well as an empirical variant of the measure that can be computed from a model`s black-box outputs.We also introduce a new dataset, SEP (Should it be Executed or Processed?), which allows estimating the measure, and we report results on several state-of-the-art open-source and closed LLMs.Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs fail to achieve a high amount of separation, according to our measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and SEP dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span></p>

                  <p>Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust long-context capabilities has been the recent research focus, resulting in the emergence of long-context LLMs proficient in Chinese.However, the evaluation of these models remains underdeveloped due to a lack of benchmarks.To address this gap, we present CLongEval, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark for evaluating long-context LLMs.CLongEval is characterized by three key features: (1) Sufficient data volume, comprising 7 distinct tasks and 7,267 examples; (2) Broad applicability, accommodating to models with context windows size from 1K to 100K; (3) High quality, with over 2,000 manually annotated question-answer pairs in addition to the automatically constructed labels.With CLongEval, we undertake a comprehensive assessment of 6 open-source long-context LLMs and 2 leading commercial counterparts that feature both long-context abilities and proficiency in Chinese.We also provide in-depth analysis based on the empirical results, trying to shed light on the critical capabilities that present challenges in long-context settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, evaluation scripts, and model outputs will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span></p>

                  <p>It is especially challenging to achieve real-time human motion tracking on a standalone VR Head-Mounted Display (HMD) such as Meta Quest and PICO.In this paper, we propose HMD-Poser, the first unified approach to recover full-body motions using scalable sparse observations from HMD and body-worn IMUs.In particular, it can support a variety of input scenarios, such as HMD, HMD+2IMUs, HMD+3IMUs, etc.The scalability of inputs may accommodate users' choices for both high tracking accuracy and easy-to-wear.A lightweight temporal-spatial feature learning network is proposed in HMD-Poser to guarantee that the model runs in real-time on HMDs.Furthermore, HMD-Poser presents online body shape estimation to improve the position accuracy of body joints.Extensive experimental results on the challenging AMASS dataset show that HMD-Poser achieves new state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and real-time performance.We also build a new free-dancing motion dataset to evaluate HMD-Poser's on-device performance and investigate the performance gap between synthetic data and real-captured sensor data.Finally, we demonstrate our HMD-Poser with a real-time Avatar-driving application on a commercial HMD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and free-dancing motion dataset are available https://pico-ai-team.github.io/hmd-poser <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>To date, toxicity mitigation in language models has almost entirely been focused on single-language settings.As language models embrace multilingual capabilities, it's crucial our safety measures keep pace.Recognizing this research gap, our approach expands the scope of conventional toxicity mitigation to address the complexities presented by multiple languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the absence of sufficient annotated datasets across languages, we employ translated data to evaluate and enhance our mitigation techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>We also compare finetuning mitigation approaches against retrieval-augmented techniques under both static and continual toxicity mitigation scenarios.This allows us to examine the effects of translation quality and the cross-lingual transfer on toxicity mitigation.We also explore how model size and data quantity affect the success of these mitigation efforts.Covering nine languages, our study represents a broad array of linguistic families and levels of resource availability, ranging from high to mid-resource languages.Through comprehensive experiments, we provide insights into the complexities of multilingual toxicity mitigation, offering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in this increasingly important field.Code and data are available at https://github.com/for-ai/goodtriever.</p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), also called zero-shot or dataless text classification, has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability in classifying a mass of texts within the dynamic and open Web environment, since it requires only a limited set of seed words (label names) for each category instead of labeled data.With the help of recently popular prompting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), many studies leveraged manually crafted and/or automatically identified verbalizers to estimate the likelihood of categories, but they failed to differentiate the effects of these category-indicative words, let alone capture their correlations and realize adaptive adjustments according to the unlabeled corpus.In this paper, in order to let the PLM effectively understand each category, we at first propose a novel form of rule-based knowledge using logical expressions to characterize the meanings of categories.Then, we develop a prompting PLM-based approach named RulePrompt for the WSTC task, consisting of a rule mining module and a rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module, plus a self-supervised fine-tuning module to make the PLM align with this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, the inaccurate pseudo labels assigned to texts and the imprecise logical rules associated with categories mutually enhance each other in an alternative manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>That establishes a self-iterative closed loop of knowledge (rule) acquisition and utilization, with seed words serving as the starting point.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which markedly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.What is more, our approach yields interpretable category rules, proving its advantage in disambiguating easily-confused categories.</p>

                  <p>Open-set graph learning is a practical task that aims to classify the known class nodes and to identify unknown class samples as unknowns.Conventional node classification methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in open-set scenarios due to the complex data they encounter, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) data and in-distribution (IND) noise.OOD data are samples that do not belong to any known classes.They are outliers if they occur in training (OOD noise), and open-set samples if they occur in testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IND noise are training samples which are assigned incorrect labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>The existence of IND noise and OOD noise is prevalent, which usually cause the ambiguity problem, including the intra-class variety problem and the inter-class confusion problem.Thus, to explore robust open-set learning methods is necessary and difficult, and it becomes even more difficult for non-IID graph data.To this end, we propose a unified framework named ROG$_{PL}$ to achieve robust open-set learning on complex noisy graph data, by introducing prototype learning.In specific, ROG$_{PL}$ consists of two modules, i.e., denoising via label propagation and open-set prototype learning via regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The first module corrects noisy labels through similarity-based label propagation and removes low-confidence samples, to solve the intra-class variety problem caused by noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>The second module learns open-set prototypes for each known class via non-overlapped regions and remains both interior and border prototypes to remedy the inter-class confusion problem.The two modules are iteratively updated under the constraints of classification loss and prototype diversity loss.To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ROG$_{PL}$ is the first robust open-set node classification method for graph data with complex noise.</p>

Our first contribution is that the two problems are equivalent to each other in the context of FPT-Approximation parameterized by $k$ (approximation is in terms of number of clauses satisfied/elements covered).We give a randomized reduction from CC-MaxSAT to MaxCov in time $O(1/\epsilon)^{k} \cdot (m+n)^{O(1)}$ that preserves the approximation guarantee up to a factor of $1-\epsilon$. Furthermore, this reduction also works in the presence of fairness and matroid constraints.

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST).LIST is featured with two novel components.Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance.Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects.Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results.We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>The concept of $k$-defective clique, a relaxation of clique by allowing up-to $k$ missing edges, has been receiving increasing interests recently.Although the problem of finding the maximum $k$-defective clique is NP-hard, several practical algorithms have been recently proposed in the literature, with kDC being the state of the art.kDCnot only runs the fastest in practice, but also achieves the best time complexity.Specifically, it runs in $O^*(\gamma_k^n)$ time when ignoring polynomial factors; here, $\gamma_k$ is a constant that is smaller than two and only depends on $k$, and $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph $G$.In this paper, we propose the kDC-Two algorithm to improve the time complexity as well as practical performance.kDC-Two runs in $O^*( (\alpha\Delta)^{k+2} \gamma_{k-1}^\alpha)$ time when the maximum $k$-defective clique size $\omega_k(G)$ is at least $k+2$, and in $O^*(\gamma_{k-1}^n)$ time otherwise, where $\alpha$ and $\Delta$ are the degeneracy and maximum degree of $G$, respectively.In addition, with slight modification, kDC-Two also runs in $O^*( (\alpha\Delta)^{k+2} (k+1)^{\alpha+k+1-\omega_k(G)})$ time by using the degeneracy gap $\alpha+k+1-\omega_k(G)$ parameterization; this is better than $O^*( (\alpha\Delta)^{k+2}\gamma_{k-1}^\alpha)$ when $\omega_k(G)$ is close to the degeneracy-based upper bound $\alpha+k+1$. Finally, to further improve the practical performance, we propose a new degree-sequence-based reduction rule that can be efficiently applied, and theoretically demonstrate its effectiveness compared with those proposed in the literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical studies on three benchmark graph collections show that our algorithm outperforms the existing fastest algorithm by several orders of magnitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>By using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), knowledge can be transferred from a label-rich source domain to a target domain that contains relevant information but lacks labels.Many existing UDA algorithms suffer from directly using raw images as input, resulting in models that overly focus on redundant information and exhibit poor generalization capability.To address this issue, we attempt to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation by employing the Fourier method (FTF).Specifically, FTF is inspired by the amplitude of Fourier spectra, which primarily preserves low-level statistical information.In FTF, we effectively incorporate low-level information from the target domain into the source domain by fusing the amplitudes of both domains in the Fourier domain.Additionally, we observe that extracting features from batches of images can eliminate redundant information while retaining class-specific features relevant to the task.Building upon this observation, we apply the Fourier Transform at the data stream level for the first time.To further align multiple sources of data, we introduce the concept of correlation alignment.To evaluate the effectiveness of our FTF method, we conducted evaluations on four benchmark datasets for domain adaptation, including Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Caltech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation aims to provide users with personalized suggestions based on their historical interactions.When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batching-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length.The special value \emph{0} is usually used as the padding content, which does not contain the actual information and is ignored in the model calculations.This common-sense padding strategy leads us to a problem that has never been explored before: \emph{Can we fully utilize this idle input space by padding other content to further improve model performance and training efficiency?}   In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective padding method called \textbf{Rep}eated \textbf{Pad}ding (\textbf{RepPad}).Specifically, we use the original interaction sequences as the padding content and fill it to the padding positions during model training.This operation can be performed a finite number of times or repeated until the input sequences' length reaches the maximum limit.Our RepPad can be viewed as a sequence-level data augmentation strategy.Unlike most existing works, our method contains no trainable parameters or hyperparameters and is a plug-and-play data augmentation operation.Extensive experiments on various categories of sequential models and five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The average recommendation performance improvement is up to 60.3\% on GRU4Rec and 24.3\% on SASRec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We also provide in-depth analysis and explanation of what makes RepPad effective from multiple perspectives.The source code will be released to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments.</p>

                  <p>To enhance localization accuracy in urban environments, an innovative LiDAR-Visual-Inertial odometry, named HDA-LVIO, is proposed by employing hybrid data association.The proposed HDA_LVIO system can be divided into two subsystems: the LiDAR-Inertial subsystem (LIS) and the Visual-Inertial subsystem (VIS).In the LIS, the LiDAR pointcloud is utilized to calculate the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) error, serving as the measurement value of Error State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) to construct the global map.In the VIS, an incremental method is firstly employed to adaptively extract planes from the global map.And the centroids of these planes are projected onto the image to obtain projection points.Then, feature points are extracted from the image and tracked along with projection points using Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow.Next, leveraging the vehicle states from previous intervals, sliding window optimization is performed to estimate the depth of feature points.Concurrently, a method based on epipolar geometric constraints is proposed to address tracking failures for feature points, which can improve the accuracy of depth estimation for feature points by ensuring sufficient parallax within the sliding window.Subsequently, the feature points and projection points are hybridly associated to construct reprojection error, serving as the measurement value of ESIKF to estimate vehicle states.Finally, the localization accuracy of the proposed HDA-LVIO is validated using public datasets and data from our equipment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves obviously improvement in localization accuracy compared to various existing algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the ever-evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), model performance has constituted a key metric driving innovation, leading to an exponential growth in model size and complexity.However, sustainability and energy efficiency have been critical requirements during deployment in contemporary industrial settings, necessitating the use of data-efficient approaches such as few-shot learning.In this paper, to alleviate the burden of lengthy model training and minimize energy consumption, a finetuning approach to adapt standard object detection models to downstream tasks is examined.Subsequently, a thorough case study and evaluation of the energy demands of the developed models, applied in object detection benchmark datasets from volatile industrial environments is presented.Specifically, different finetuning strategies as well as utilization of ancillary evaluation data during training are examined, and the trade-off between performance and efficiency is highlighted in this low-data regime.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, this paper introduces a novel way to quantify this trade-off through a customized Efficiency Factor metric. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large size kernels have attracted much attention in the computer vision field, following the success of the Vision Transformers.Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance.The reason for the high-performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels, but this view has not been fully tested.We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task, focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task.WSOL, a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised, provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs.Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance.Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective, in which the main factor is feature map improvement.Furthermore, we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated, which has long been discussed in WSOL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CAM is the most classic WSOL method, but because of the above-mentioned problems, it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>However, experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN, CAM, and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method, which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing.The code is available at https://github.com/snskysk/CAM-Back-Again.</p>

                  <p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) stands as an effective intervention for alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).Traditional commercial DBS devices are only able to deliver fixed-frequency periodic pulses to the basal ganglia (BG) regions of the brain, i.e., continuous DBS (cDBS).However, they in general suffer from energy inefficiency and side effects, such as speech impairment.Recent research has focused on adaptive DBS (aDBS) to resolve the limitations of cDBS.Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches have been developed to adapt the frequencies of the stimuli in order to achieve both energy efficiency and treatment efficacy.However, RL approaches in general require significant amount of training data and computational resources, making it intractable to integrate RL policies into real-time embedded systems as needed in aDBS.In contrast, contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) in general lead to better sample efficiency compared to RL.In this study, we propose a CMAB solution for aDBS.Specifically, we define the context as the signals capturing irregular neuronal firing activities in the BG regions (i.e., beta-band power spectral density), while each arm signifies the (discretized) pulse frequency of the stimulation.Moreover, an {\epsilon}-exploring strategy is introduced on top of the classic Thompson sampling method, leading to an algorithm called {\epsilon}-Neural Thompson sampling ({\epsilon}-NeuralTS), such that the learned CMAB policy can better balance exploration and exploitation of the BG environment.The {\epsilon}-NeuralTS algorithm is evaluated using a computation BG model that captures the neuronal activities in PD patients' brains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that our method outperforms both existing cDBS methods and CMAB baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span></p>

                  <p>Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to query the unseen facts of a relation given its few-shot reference entity pairs.The side effect of noises due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning, but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more susceptible to limited reference samples with noises.In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning representations under Gaussian distribution.Uncertainty representation is first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution.Further, to better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions.Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the optimization.The final completion score for each query instance is measured by the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the noises in few-shot scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our approach achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>The trustworthy machine learning (ML) community is increasingly recognizing the crucial need for models capable of selectively 'unlearning' data points after training.This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning.Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance.To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility.Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness.Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies.Our results illuminate the complex challenges of MU in practice, guiding the future development of more accurate and robust unlearning algorithms.The code is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-WorstCase.</p>

Second, some papers don't use a realistic membership base rate, leading to incorrect precision measures if precision is reported.Third, some papers unnecessarily report measures in such a way that it is difficult or impossible to assess risk.Virtually the entire literature on membership inference attacks, dozens of papers, make one or both of these errors.We propose that membership inference papers report precision/recall values using a representative range of base rates.</p>

                  <p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer an agent's preferences (represented as a reward function $R$) from their behaviour (represented as a policy $\pi$).To do this, we need a behavioural model of how $\pi$ relates to $R$. In the current literature, the most common behavioural models are optimality, Boltzmann-rationality, and causal entropy maximisation.However, the true relationship between a human's preferences and their behaviour is much more complex than any of these behavioural models.This means that the behavioural models are misspecified, which raises the concern that they may lead to systematic errors if applied to real data.In this paper, we analyse how sensitive the IRL problem is to misspecification of the behavioural model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that completely characterise how the observed data may differ from the assumed behavioural model without incurring an error above a given threshold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>In addition to this, we also characterise the conditions under which a behavioural model is robust to small perturbations of the observed policy, and we analyse how robust many behavioural models are to misspecification of their parameter values (such as e.g.\ the discount rate).Our analysis suggests that the IRL problem is highly sensitive to misspecification, in the sense that very mild misspecification can lead to very large errors in the inferred reward function.</p>

                  <p>Traditional sequential recommendation methods assume that users' sequence data is clean enough to learn accurate sequence representations to reflect user preferences.In practice, users' sequences inevitably contain noise (e.g., accidental interactions), leading to incorrect reflections of user preferences.Consequently, some pioneer studies have explored modeling sequentiality and correlations in sequences to implicitly or explicitly reduce noise's influence.However, relying on only available intra-sequence information (i.e., sequentiality and correlations in a sequence) is insufficient and may result in over-denoising and under-denoising problems (OUPs), especially for short sequences.To improve reliability, we propose to augment sequences by inserting items before denoising.However, due to the data sparsity issue and computational costs, it is challenging to select proper items from the entire item universe to insert into proper positions in a target sequence.Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel framework--Self-augmented Sequence Denoising for sequential Recommendation (SSDRec) with a three-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges.In the first stage, we empower SSDRec by a global relation encoder to learn multi-faceted inter-sequence relations in a data-driven manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These relations serve as prior knowledge to guide subsequent stages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>In the second stage, we devise a self-augmentation module to augment sequences to alleviate OUPs.Finally, we employ a hierarchical denoising module in the third stage to reduce the risk of false augmentations and pinpoint all noise in raw sequences.Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of \model over state-of-the-art denoising methods and its flexible applications to mainstream sequential recommendation models.The source code is available at https://github.com/zc-97/SSDRec.</p>

                  <p>A key challenge in medical decision making is learning treatment policies for patients with limited observational data.This challenge is particularly evident in personalized healthcare decision-making, where models need to take into account the intricate relationships between patient characteristics, treatment options, and health outcomes.To address this, we introduce prescriptive networks (PNNs), shallow 0-1 neural networks trained with mixed integer programming that can be used with counterfactual estimation to optimize policies in medium data settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These models offer greater interpretability than deep neural networks and can encode more complex policies than common models such as decision trees. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>We show that PNNs can outperform existing methods in both synthetic data experiments and in a case study of assigning treatments for postpartum hypertension.In particular, PNNs are shown to produce policies that could reduce peak blood pressure by 5.47 mmHg (p=0.02) over existing clinical practice, and by 2 mm Hg (p=0.01) over the next best prescriptive modeling technique.Moreover PNNs were more likely than all other models to correctly identify clinically significant features while existing models relied on potentially dangerous features such as patient insurance information and race that could lead to bias in treatment.</p>

                  <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, with blood pressure serving as a crucial indicator.Arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms provide continuous pressure measurements throughout the cardiac cycle and offer valuable diagnostic insights.Consequently, there is a significant demand for non-invasive and cuff-less methods to measure ABP waveforms continuously.Accurate prediction of ABP waveforms can also improve the estimation of mean blood pressure, an essential cardiovascular health characteristic.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study proposes a novel framework based on the physics-informed DeepONet approach to predict ABP waveforms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Unlike previous methods, our approach requires the predicted ABP waveforms to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equation with a time-periodic condition and a Windkessel boundary condition.Notably, our framework is the first to predict ABP waveforms continuously, both with location and time, within the part of the artery that is being simulated.Furthermore, our method only requires ground truth data at the outlet boundary and can handle periodic conditions with varying periods.Incorporating the Windkessel boundary condition in our solution allows for generating natural physical reflection waves, which closely resemble measurements observed in real-world cases.Moreover, accurately estimating the hyper-parameters in the Navier-Stokes equation for our simulations poses a significant challenge.To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the concept of meta-learning, enabling the neural networks to learn these parameters during the training process.</p>

                  <p>Motivated by the importance of dynamic programming (DP) in parameterized complexity, we consider several fine-grained questions, such as the following examples: (i) can Dominating Set be solved in time $(3-\epsilon)^{pw}n^{O(1)}$? (where $pw$ is the pathwidth) (ii) can Coloring be solved in time $pw^{(1-\epsilon)pw}n^{O(1)}$?(iii) can a short reconfiguration between two size-$k$ independent sets be found in time $n^{(1-\epsilon)k}$?Such questions are well-studied: in some cases the answer is No under the SETH, while in others coarse-grained lower bounds are known under the ETH.Even though questions such as the above seem "morally equivalent" as they all ask if a simple DP can be improved, the problems concerned have wildly varying time complexities, ranging from single-exponential FPT to XNLP-complete.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper's main contribution is to show that, despite their varying complexities, these questions are not just morally equivalent, but in fact they are the same question in disguise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>We achieve this by putting forth a natural complexity assumption which we call the Primal Pathwidth-Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (PP-SETH) and which states that 3-SAT cannot be solved in time $(2-\epsilon)^{pw}n^{O(1)}$, for any $\epsilon>0$, where $pw$ is the pathwidth of the primal graph of the input.We then show that numerous fine-grained questions in parameterized complexity, including the ones above, are equivalent to the PP-SETH, and hence to each other.This allows us to obtain sharp fine-grained lower bounds for problems for which previous lower bounds left a constant in the exponent undetermined, but also to increase our confidence in bounds which were previously known under the SETH, because we show that breaking any one such bound requires breaking all (old and new) bounds; and because we show that the PP-SETH is more plausible than the SETH.</p>

This is an Learned Image Compression (LIC) model trained using edge information created by Segment Anything.   Our method can be used for image recognition models with various tasks.   SA-ICM is also robust to changes in input data, making it effective for a variety of use cases.   Additionally, our method provides benefits from a privacy point of view, as it removes human facial information on the encoder's side, thus protecting one's privacy.   Furthermore, this LIC model training method can be used to train Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV), which is a video compression model.   By training NeRV using edge information created by Segment Anything, it is possible to create a NeRV that is effective for image recognition (SA-NeRV).   Experimental results confirm the advantages of SA-ICM, presenting the best performance in image compression for image recognition.   We also show that SA-NeRV is superior to ordinary NeRV in video compression for machines.</p>
