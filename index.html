                  <p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks.However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge.To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities.In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM.Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification.To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector.Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains.We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics.Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating images with accurately represented text, especially in non-Latin languages, poses a significant challenge for diffusion models.Existing approaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary networks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue.However, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text generation, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small fonts.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual text creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text during the image generation process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our methodology begins with assembling a training dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.904</span></span>Each pair includes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the font style within the image.We then developed a text control network, Font ControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image generation.To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style, notably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware loss into the diffusion process.This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text rendering using low-level descriptors.Our evaluations, based on both visual and accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.Additionally, JoyType can function as a plugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with other stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI.Our project is open-sourced on https://jdh-algo.github.io/JoyType/.</p>

                  <p>Extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information.Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs.To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries.Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information.This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation.Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with long-context processing are still challenging because of their implementation complexity, training efficiency and data sparsity.To address this issue, a new paradigm named Online Long-context Processing (OLP) is proposed when we process a document of unlimited length, which typically occurs in the information reception and organization of diverse streaming media such as automated news reporting, live e-commerce, and viral short videos.Moreover, a dilemma was often encountered when we tried to select the most suitable LLM from a large number of LLMs amidst explosive growth aiming for outstanding performance, affordable prices, and short response delays.In view of this, we also develop Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline according to their actual performance.Extensive experiments are conducted on our OLP-MINI dataset and it is found that OLP with Role-RL framework achieves OLP benchmark with an average recall rate of 93.2% and the LLM cost saved by 79.4%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Role-RL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.912</span></span></p>

In this paper, we present SelectiveKD, a semi-supervised learning framework for building cancer detection models for DBT, which only requires a limited number of annotated slices to reach high performance.We achieve this by utilizing unlabeled slices available in a DBT stack through a knowledge distillation framework in which the teacher model provides a supervisory signal to the student model for all slices in the DBT volume.Our framework mitigates the potential noise in the supervisory signal from a sub-optimal teacher by implementing a selective dataset expansion strategy using pseudo labels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach with a large-scale real-world dataset of over 10,000 DBT exams collected from multiple device manufacturers and locations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>The resulting SelectiveKD process effectively utilizes unannotated slices from a DBT stack, leading to significantly improved cancer classification performance (AUC) and generalization performance.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation.One drawback however is the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which makes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the limited hardware resources.Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of the representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and computational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad data distribution of DNN models.Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based quantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve accuracy.In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical modeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN inference on embedded platforms.We formulate and resolve an optimization problem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the trade-off of both accuracy and performance loss.Experimental results show that compared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth allocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Cheliosoops/BitQ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span></p>

                  <p>Logical reasoning is a fundamental task in natural language processing that presents significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs).The inherent characteristics of logical reasoning makes it well-suited for symbolic representations such as first-order logic (FOL).Research in symbolic logical reasoning explored FOL generation using state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) to produce FOL translations of natural language (NL) statements, but errors in translation are usually not the focus.We address this by categorizing the translation errors in FOL statements generated by LLMs.To make progress towards improving the quality of FOL translations for smaller language models such as LLaMA-2 13B and Mistral 7B, we create ProofFOL, a high-quality FOL-annotated subset of ProofWriter dataset using GPT-4o.The models fine-tuned on this silver standard data achieve a significant gain in performance when compared to larger language models such as LLaMA-2 70B.In addition to improving the model using large data, we also tackle the issue of data scarcity and introduce an incremental framework encompassing of data augmentation and verification steps.In the augmentation process, a single pair of (premises, conclusion) is split into multiple new instances based on the predicates and FOLs.This data is used for fine-tuning, and the inference on this model generates FOLs with fewer errors over the model trained on the original data.Our investigation on the translation errors leads to generation of a perturbation dataset, which is used to train a verifier that corrects potential syntactic and semantic FOL translation errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate an efficient method for making the most of a limited existing human-annotated dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span>Our results show state-of-the-art performance for ProofWriter and ProntoQA datasets using ProofFOL on LLaMA-2 and Mistral models.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, drone detection has quickly become a subject of extreme interest: the potential for fast-moving objects of contained dimensions to be used for malicious intents or even terrorist attacks has posed attention to the necessity for precise and resilient systems for detecting and identifying such elements.While extensive literature and works exist on object detection based on RGB data, it is also critical to recognize the limits of such modality when applied to UAVs detection.Detecting drones indeed poses several challenges such as fast-moving objects and scenes with a high dynamic range or, even worse, scarce illumination levels.Neuromorphic cameras, on the other hand, can retain precise and rich spatio-temporal information in situations that are challenging for RGB cameras.They are resilient to both high-speed moving objects and scarce illumination settings, while prone to suffer a rapid loss of information when the objects in the scene are static.In this context, we present a novel model for integrating both domains together, leveraging multimodal data to take advantage of the best of both worlds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we also release NeRDD (Neuromorphic-RGB Drone Detection), a novel spatio-temporally synchronized Event-RGB Drone detection dataset of more than 3.5 hours of multimodal annotated recordings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span></p>

                  <p>Radiology is a vital and complex component of modern clinical workflow and covers many tasks.Recently, vision-language (VL) foundation models in medicine have shown potential in processing multimodal information, offering a unified solution for various radiology tasks.However, existing studies either pre-trained VL models on natural data or did not fully integrate vision-language architecture and pretraining, often neglecting the unique multimodal complexity in radiology images and their textual contexts.Additionally, their practical applicability in real-world scenarios remains underexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we present RadFound, a large and open-source vision-language foundation model tailored for radiology, that is trained on the most extensive dataset of over 8.1 million images and 250,000 image-text pairs, covering 19 major organ systems and 10 imaging modalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>To establish expert-level multimodal perception and generation capabilities, RadFound introduces an enhanced vision encoder to capture intra-image local features and inter-image contextual information, and a unified cross-modal learning design tailored to radiology.To fully assess the models' capability, we construct a benchmark, RadVLBench, including radiology interpretation tasks like medical vision-language question-answering, as well as text generation tasks ranging from captioning to report generation.We also propose a human evaluation framework.When evaluated on the real-world benchmark involving three representative modalities, 2D images (chest X-rays), multi-view images (mammograms), and 3D images (thyroid CT scans), RadFound significantly outperforms other VL foundation models on both quantitative metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the development of RadFound represents an advancement in radiology generalists, demonstrating broad applicability potential for integration into clinical workflows.</p>

We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing a small, relevant, portion of the data.   panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.   panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in terms of the other.   This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures (Jaccard, Dice, etc.).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic, and set data.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.   panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.

                  <p>Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) leverages practical open-set unlabeled data, comprising both in-distribution (ID) samples from seen classes and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from unseen classes, for semi-supervised learning (SSL).Prior OSSL methods initially learned the decision boundary between ID and OOD with labeled ID data, subsequently employing self-training to refine this boundary.These methods, however, suffer from the tendency to overtrust the labeled ID data: the scarcity of labeled data caused the distribution bias between the labeled samples and the entire ID data, which misleads the decision boundary to overfit.The subsequent self-training process, based on the overfitted result, fails to rectify this problem.In this paper, we address the overtrusting issue by treating OOD samples as an additional class, forming a new SSL process.   Specifically, we propose SCOMatch, a novel OSSL method that 1) selects reliable OOD samples as new labeled data with an OOD memory queue and a corresponding update strategy and 2) integrates the new SSL process into the original task through our Simultaneous Close-set and Open-set self-training.SCOMatch refines the decision boundary of ID and OOD classes across the entire dataset, thereby leading to improved results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results show that SCOMatch significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>The effectiveness is further verified through ablation studies and visualization.</p>

                  <p>Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays.Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction.One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data.Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements.Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important.From this spot, the spike classification concept commences.Previously, researchers classified spikes manually.The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis.Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly.This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises.The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation.Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved.The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies.In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases.The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers.Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.</p>

                  <p>Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image.Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning.However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions.This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion.Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple.In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated.In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding.Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks.Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch.This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed.Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span>Codes and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/SimVG}.</p>

                  <p>Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks.Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources.Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization.However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances.This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy.Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness.Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration.First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity.Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness.By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM).Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch.The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available.Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</p>

Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T.

                  <p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks.However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation.In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency.And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize.Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction.Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance.We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed.Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions.Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It also significantly enhances efficiency, being hundreds of times faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reliable prediction of the All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) is pivotal for informed policymaking for the country, impacting the lives of billions of people.However, accurate simulation of AISMR has been a persistent challenge due to the complex interplay of various muti-scale factors and the inherent variability of the monsoon system.This research focuses on adapting and fine-tuning the latest LLM model, PatchTST, to accurately predict AISMR with a lead time of three months.The fine-tuned PatchTST model, trained with historical AISMR data, the Ni\~no3.4 index, and categorical Indian Ocean Dipole values, outperforms several popular neural network models and statistical models.This fine-tuned LLM model exhibits an exceptionally low RMSE percentage of 0.07% and a Spearman correlation of 0.976.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is particularly impressive, since it is nearly 80% more accurate than the best-performing NN models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The model predicts an above-normal monsoon for the year 2024, with an accumulated rainfall of 921.6 mm in the month of June-September for the entire country.</p>

                  <p>Cardinality estimation (CE) plays a crucial role in many database-related tasks such as query generation, cost estimation, and join ordering.Lately, we have witnessed the emergence of numerous learned CE models.However, no single CE model is invincible when it comes to the datasets with various data distributions.To facilitate data-intensive applications with accurate and efficient cardinality estimation, it is important to have an approach that can judiciously and efficiently select the most suitable CE model for an arbitrary dataset.   In this paper, we study a new problem of selecting the best CE models for a variety of datasets.This problem is rather challenging as it is hard to capture the relationship from various datasets to the performance of disparate models.To address this problem, we propose a model advisor, named AutoCE, which can adaptively select the best model for a dataset.The main contribution of AutoCE is the learning-based model selection, where deep metric learning is used to learn a recommendation model and incremental learning is proposed to reduce the labeling overhead and improve the model robustness.We have integrated AutoCE into PostgreSQL and evaluated its impact on query optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results showed that AutoCE achieved the best performance (27% better) and outperformed the baselines concerning accuracy (2.1 times better) and efficacy (4.2 times better). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>In supervised machine learning, models are typically trained using data with hard labels, i.e., definite assignments of class membership.This traditional approach, however, does not take the inherent uncertainty in these labels into account.We investigate whether incorporating label uncertainty, represented as discrete probability distributions over the class labels -- known as soft labels -- improves the predictive performance of classification models.We first demonstrate the potential value of soft label learning (SLL) for estimating model parameters in a simulation experiment, particularly for limited sample sizes and imbalanced data.Subsequently, we compare the performance of various wrapper methods for learning from both hard and soft labels using identical base classifiers.On real-world-inspired synthetic data with clean labels, the SLL methods consistently outperform hard label methods.Since real-world data is often noisy and precise soft labels are challenging to obtain, we study the effect that noisy probability estimates have on model performance.Alongside conventional noise models, our study examines four types of miscalibration that are known to affect human annotators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that SLL methods outperform the hard label methods in the majority of settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Finally, we evaluate the methods on a real-world dataset with confidence scores, where the SLL methods are shown to match the traditional methods for predicting the (noisy) hard labels while providing more accurate confidence estimates.</p>

                  <p>Speech deepfakes pose a significant threat to personal security and content authenticity.Several detectors have been proposed in the literature, and one of the primary challenges these systems have to face is the generalization over unseen data to identify fake signals across a wide range of datasets.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for enhancing speech deepfake detection performance using a Mixture of Experts architecture.The Mixture of Experts framework is well-suited for the speech deepfake detection task due to its ability to specialize in different input types and handle data variability efficiently.This approach offers superior generalization and adaptability to unseen data compared to traditional single models or ensemble methods.Additionally, its modular structure supports scalable updates, making it more flexible in managing the evolving complexity of deepfake techniques while maintaining high detection accuracy.We propose an efficient, lightweight gating mechanism to dynamically assign expert weights for each input, optimizing detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance time series forecasting using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents.With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates various social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations for enriched insights.Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning and reflection to evaluate predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables our model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>By compiling selected news with time series data, we fine-tune the LLaMa2 pre-trained model.The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and suggest a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting by effectively harnessing unstructured news data.</p>

                  <p>Preference optimization methods typically begin training with a well-trained SFT model as a reference model.In RLHF and DPO, a regularization term is used during the preference optimization process to prevent the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model's distribution, thereby avoiding the generation of anomalous responses.When the reference model is already well-aligned with the given data or only requires slight adjustments, this approach can produce a well-aligned model.However, if the reference model is not aligned with the given data and requires significant deviation from its current state, a regularization term may actually hinder the model alignment.In this study, we propose \textbf{Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO)} to address this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MIPO modulates the degree of intervention from the reference model based on how well the given data is aligned with it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If the data is well-aligned, the intervention is increased to prevent the policy model from diverging significantly from reference model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span>Conversely, if the alignment is poor, the interference is reduced to facilitate more extensive training.We compare the performance of MIPO and DPO using Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B in Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench.The experimental results demonstrate that MIPO consistently outperforms DPO across various evaluation scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Modelling longitudinal data is an important yet challenging task.These datasets can be high-dimensional, contain non-linear effects and time-varying covariates.Gaussian process (GP) prior-based variational autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as a promising approach due to their ability to model time-series data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they are costly to train and struggle to fully exploit the rich covariates characteristic of longitudinal data, making them difficult for practitioners to use effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>In this work, we leverage linear mixed models (LMMs) and amortized variational inference to provide conditional priors for VAEs, and propose LMM-VAE, a scalable, interpretable and identifiable model.We highlight theoretical connections between it and GP-based techniques, providing a unified framework for this class of methods.Our proposal performs competitively compared to existing approaches across simulated and real-world datasets.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain integration in industries like online advertising is hindered by its connectivity limitations to off-chain data.These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems for collecting and analyzing off-chain data.This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts.However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge.   To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems.In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake.Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increment the counter in a smart contract.Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available.Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters.In such conditions, our game-theoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty.</p>

                  <p>The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of new models and ways to process users data.The majority of work that has been done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches.However, with the emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique advantages in certain domains or applications.One of these domains is Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance.Due to its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under personalized conditions.In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL: Tsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class.In this way, clustering can benefit from two key advantages.Firstly, clients share only what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been enough during the training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Secondly, by sharing only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication cost.The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions.For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data.Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the Gaussian derivative networks achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks.   We first experimentally demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales.Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties.We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation.   In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of Gaussian derivative networks, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have very good explainability properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data sparsity is a key challenge limiting the power of AI tools across various domains.The problem is especially pronounced in domains that require active user input rather than measurements derived from automated sensors.It is a critical barrier to harnessing the full potential of AI in domains requiring active user engagement, such as self-reported mood check-ins, where capturing a continuous picture of emotional states is essential.In this context, sparse data can hinder efforts to capture the nuances of individual emotional experiences such as causes, triggers, and contributing factors.Existing methods for addressing data scarcity often rely on heuristics or large established datasets, favoring deep learning models that lack adaptability to new domains.This paper proposes a novel probabilistic framework that integrates user-centric feedback-based learning, allowing for personalized predictions despite limited data.Achieving 60% accuracy in predicting user states among 64 options (chance of 1/64), this framework effectively mitigates data sparsity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is versatile across various applications, bridging the gap between theoretical AI research and practical deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays.Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction.One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data.Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements.Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important.From this spot, the spike classification concept commences.Previously, researchers classified spikes manually.The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises.The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation.Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined.The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms.The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved.The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies.In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases.The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers.Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.</p>

                  <p>Impedance-controlled robots are widely used on Earth to perform interaction-rich tasks and will be a key enabler for In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM) activities.This paper introduces the software architecture used on the On-Board Computer (OBC) for the planned SpaceDREAM mission aiming to validate such robotic arm in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with KINETIK Space GmbH and the Technical University of Munich (TUM).During the mission several free motion as well as contact tasks are to be performed in order to verify proper functionality of the robot in position and impedance control on joint level as well as in cartesian control.The tasks are selected to be representative for subsequent servicing missions e.g. requiring interface docking or precise manipulation.   The software on the OBC commands the robot's joints via SpaceWire to perform those mission tasks, reads camera images and data from additional sensors and sends telemetry data through an Ethernet link via the spacecraft down to Earth.It is set up to execute a predefined mission after receiving a start signal from the spacecraft while it should be extendable to receive commands from Earth for later missions.Core design principle was to reuse as much existing software and to stay as close as possible to existing robot software stacks at DLR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This allowed for a quick full operational start of the robot arm compared to a custom development of all robot software, a lower entry barrier for software developers as well as a reuse of existing libraries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While not every line of code can be tested with this design, most of the software has already proven its functionality through daily execution on multiple robot systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research.The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity.This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions.Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance.Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Semantic communications (SC) is an emerging communication paradigm in which wireless devices can send only relevant information from a source of data while relying on computing resources to regenerate missing data points.However, the design of a multi-user SC system becomes more challenging because of the computing and communication overhead required for coordination.Existing solutions for learning the semantic language and performing resource allocation often fail to capture the computing and communication tradeoffs involved in multiuser SC.To address this gap, a novel framework for decentralized computing and communication resource allocation in multiuser SC systems is proposed.The challenge of efficiently allocating communication and computing resources (for reasoning) in a decentralized manner to maximize the quality of task experience for the end users is addressed through the application of Stackelberg hyper game theory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging the concept of second-level hyper games, novel analytical formulations are developed to model misperceptions of the users about each other's communication and control strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>Further, equilibrium analysis of the learned resource allocation protocols examines the convergence of the computing and communication strategies to a local Stackelberg equilibria, considering misperceptions.Simulation results show that the proposed Stackelberg hyper game results in efficient usage of communication and computing resources while maintaining a high quality of experience for the users compared to state-of-the-art that does not account for the misperceptions.</p>

                  <p>We develop formal privacy mechanisms for releasing statistics from data with many outlying values, such as income data.These mechanisms ensure that a per-record differential privacy guarantee degrades slowly in the protected records' influence on the statistics being released.   Formal privacy mechanisms generally add randomness, or "noise," to published statistics.If a noisy statistic's distribution changes little with the addition or deletion of a single record in the underlying dataset, an attacker looking at this statistic will find it plausible that any particular record was present or absent, preserving the records' privacy.More influential records -- those whose addition or deletion would change the statistics' distribution more -- typically suffer greater privacy loss.The per-record differential privacy framework quantifies these record-specific privacy guarantees, but existing mechanisms let these guarantees degrade rapidly (linearly or quadratically) with influence.While this may be acceptable in cases with some moderately influential records, it results in unacceptably high privacy losses when records' influence varies widely, as is common in economic data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop mechanisms with privacy guarantees that instead degrade as slowly as logarithmically with influence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>These mechanisms allow for the accurate, unbiased release of statistics, while providing meaningful protection for highly influential records.As an example, we consider the private release of sums of unbounded establishment data such as payroll, where our mechanisms extend meaningful privacy protection even to very large establishments.We evaluate these mechanisms empirically and demonstrate their utility.</p>

                  <p>Developing efficient traffic models is essential for optimizing transportation systems, yet current approaches remain time-intensive and susceptible to human errors due to their reliance on manual processes.Traditional workflows involve exhaustive literature reviews, formula optimization, and iterative testing, leading to inefficiencies in research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we introduce the Traffic Research Agent (TR-Agent), an AI-driven system designed to autonomously develop and refine traffic models through an iterative, closed-loop process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>Specifically, we divide the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization; and construct TR-Agent with four corresponding modules: Idea Generator, Code Generator, Evaluator, and Analyzer.Working in synergy, these modules retrieve knowledge from external resources, generate novel ideas, implement and debug models, and finally assess them on the evaluation datasets.Furthermore, the system continuously refines these models based on iterative feedback, enhancing research efficiency and model performance.Experimental results demonstrate that TR-Agent achieves significant performance improvements across multiple traffic models, including the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car following, the MOBIL lane-changing model, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traffic flow model.Additionally, TR-Agent provides detailed explanations for its optimizations, allowing researchers to verify and build upon its improvements easily.This flexibility makes the framework a powerful tool for researchers in transportation and beyond.To further support research and collaboration, we have open-sourced both the code and data used in our experiments, facilitating broader access and enabling continued advancements in the field.</p>

                  <p>In this paper we introduce a general version of the anonymization problem in social networks, in which the goal is to maximize the number of anonymous nodes by altering a given graph.We define three variants of this optimization problem, being full, partial and budgeted anonymization.In each, the objective is to maximize the number of k-anonymous nodes, i.e., nodes for which there are at least k-1 equivalent nodes, according to a particular anonymity measure of structural node equivalence.We propose six new heuristic algorithms for solving the anonymization problem which we implement into the reusable ANO-NET computational framework.As a baseline, we use an edge sampling method introduced in previous work.Experiments on both graph models and 17 real-world network datasets result in three empirical findings.First, we demonstrate that edge deletion is the most effective graph alteration operation.Second, we compare four commonly used anonymity measures from the literature and highlight how the choice of anonymity measure has a tremendous effect on both the achieved anonymity as well as the difficulty of solving the anonymization problem.Third, we find that the proposed algorithms that preferentially delete edges with a larger effect on nodes at a structurally unique position consistently outperform heuristics solely based on network structure.With similar runtimes, our algorithms retain on average 17 times more edges, ensuring higher data utility after full anonymization.In the budgeted variant, they achieve 4.4 times more anonymous nodes than the baseline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work lays important foundations for future development of algorithms for anonymizing social networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>Peg-in-hole assembly in unknown environments is a challenging task due to onboard sensor errors, which result in uncertainty and variations in task parameters such as the hole position and orientation.Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) has been proposed to mitigate this problem as it learns how to quickly adapt to new tasks with different parameters.However, previous approaches either depend on a sample-inefficient procedure or human demonstrations to perform the task in the real world.Our work modifies the data used by the Meta RL agent and uses simple features that can be easily measured in the real world even with an uncalibrated camera.We further adapt the Meta RL agent to use data from a force/torque sensor, instead of the camera, to perform the assembly, using a small amount of training data.Finally, we propose a fine-tuning method that consistently and safely adapts to out-of-distribution tasks with parameters that differ by a factor of 10 from the training tasks.Our results demonstrate that the proposed data modification significantly enhances the training and adaptation efficiency and enables the agent to achieve 100% success in tasks with different hole positions and orientations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on a real robot confirm that both camera- and force/torque sensor-equipped agents achieve 100% success in tasks with unknown hole positions, matching their simulation performance and validating the approach's robustness and applicability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Compared to the previous work with sample-inefficient adaptation, our proposed methods are 10 times more sample-efficient in the real-world tasks.</p>
