                  <p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation.SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions.The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications.Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods.This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor.A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images.Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR.We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p>

                  <p>In the last two decades, several researchers provided snapshots of the "current" state and evolution of empirical research in requirements engineering (RE) through literature reviews.However, these literature reviews were not sustainable, as none built on or updated previous works due to the unavailability of the extracted and analyzed data.KG-EmpiRE is a Knowledge Graph (KG) of empirical research in RE based on scientific data extracted from currently 680 papers published in the IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (1994-2022).KG-EmpiRE is maintained in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), making all data openly and long-term available according to the FAIR data principles.Our long-term goal is to constantly maintain KG-EmpiRE with the research community to synthesize a comprehensive, up-to-date, and long-term available overview of the state and evolution of empirical research in RE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides KG-EmpiRE, we provide its analysis with all supplementary materials in a repository. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>This repository contains all files with instructions for replicating and (re-)using the analysis locally or via executable environments and for repeating the research approach.Since its first release based on 199 papers (2014-2022), KG-EmpiRE and its analysis have been updated twice, currently covering over 650 papers.KG-EmpiRE and its analysis demonstrate how innovative infrastructures, such as the ORKG, can be leveraged to make data from literature reviews FAIR, openly available, and maintainable for the research community in the long term.In this way, we can enable replicable, (re-)usable, and thus sustainable literature reviews to ensure the quality, reliability, and timeliness of their research results.</p>

                  <p>The SemEval task on Argument Reasoning in Civil Procedure is challenging in that it requires understanding legal concepts and inferring complex arguments.Currently, most Large Language Models (LLM) excelling in the legal realm are principally purposed for classification tasks, hence their reasoning rationale is subject to contention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The approach we advocate involves using a powerful teacher-LLM (ChatGPT) to extend the training dataset with explanations and generate synthetic data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>The resulting data are then leveraged to fine-tune a small student-LLM.Contrary to previous work, our explanations are not directly derived from the teacher's internal knowledge.Instead they are grounded in authentic human analyses, therefore delivering a superior reasoning signal.Additionally, a new `mutation' method generates artificial data instances inspired from existing ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We are publicly releasing the explanations as an extension to the original dataset, along with the synthetic dataset and the prompts that were used to generate both. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Our system ranked 15th in the SemEval competition.It outperforms its own teacher and can produce explanations aligned with the original human analyses, as verified by legal experts.</p>

                  <p>Recent research yielded a wide array of drift detectors.However, in order to achieve remarkable performance, the true class labels must be available during the drift detection phase.This paper targets at detecting drift when the ground truth is unknown during the detection phase.To that end, we introduce Gaussian Split Detector (GSD) a novel drift detector that works in batch mode.GSD is designed to work when the data follow a normal distribution and makes use of Gaussian mixture models to monitor changes in the decision boundary.The algorithm is designed to handle multi-dimension data streams and to work without the ground truth labels during the inference phase making it pertinent for real world use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In an extensive experimental study on real and synthetic datasets, we evaluate our detector against the state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We show that our detector outperforms the state of the art in detecting real drift and in ignoring virtual drift which is key to avoid false alarms.</p>

                  <p>The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) is pivotal in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer through MRI imaging.Current deep learning-based PI-RADS scoring methods often lack the incorporation of essential PI-RADS clinical guidelines~(PICG) utilized by radiologists, potentially compromising scoring accuracy.This paper introduces a novel approach that adapts a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to incorporate PICG into PI-RADS scoring without additional annotations and network parameters.We present a two-stage fine-tuning process aimed at adapting MLLMs originally trained on natural images to the MRI data domain while effectively integrating the PICG.In the first stage, we develop a domain adapter layer specifically tailored for processing 3D MRI image inputs and design the MLLM instructions to differentiate MRI modalities effectively.In the second stage, we translate PICG into guiding instructions for the model to generate PICG-guided image features.Through feature distillation, we align scoring network features with the PICG-guided image feature, enabling the scoring network to effectively incorporate the PICG information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop our model on a public dataset and evaluate it in a real-world challenging in-house dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of current scoring networks.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection in distributed systems such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters is vital for early fault detection, performance optimisation, security monitoring, reliability in general but also operational insights.Deep Neural Networks have seen successful use in detecting long-term anomalies in multidimensional data, originating for instance from industrial or medical systems, or weather prediction.A downside of such methods is that they require a static input size, or lose data through cropping, sampling, or other dimensionality reduction methods, making deployment on systems with variability on monitored data channels, such as computing clusters difficult.To address these problems, we present DeepHYDRA (Deep Hybrid DBSCAN/Reduction-Based Anomaly Detection) which combines DBSCAN and learning-based anomaly detection.DBSCAN clustering is used to find point anomalies in time-series data, mitigating the risk of missing outliers through loss of information when reducing input data to a fixed number of channels.A deep learning-based time-series anomaly detection method is then applied to the reduced data in order to identify long-term outliers.This hybrid approach reduces the chances of missing anomalies that might be made indistinguishable from normal data by the reduction process, and likewise enables the algorithm to be scalable and tolerate partial system failures while retaining its detection capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a subset of the well-known SMD dataset family, a modified variant of the Eclipse dataset, as well as an in-house dataset with a large variability in active data channels, made publicly available with this work, we furthermore analyse computational intensity, memory footprint, and activation counts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>DeepHYDRA is shown to reliably detect different types of anomalies in both large and complex datasets.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour.A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the development and evaluation of machine translation models from Cantonese to English, where we propose a novel approach to tackle low-resource language translations.The main objectives of the study are to develop a model that can effectively translate Cantonese to English and evaluate it against state-of-the-art commercial models.To achieve this, a new parallel corpus has been created by combining different available corpora online with preprocessing and cleaning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, a monolingual Cantonese dataset has been created through web scraping to aid the synthetic parallel corpus generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>Following the data collection process, several approaches, including fine-tuning models, back-translation, and model switch, have been used.The translation quality of models has been evaluated with multiple quality metrics, including lexicon-based metrics (SacreBLEU and hLEPOR) and embedding-space metrics (COMET and BERTscore).Based on the automatic metrics, the best model is selected and compared against the 2 best commercial translators using the human evaluation framework HOPES.The best model proposed in this investigation (NLLB-mBART) with model switch mechanisms has reached comparable and even better automatic evaluation scores against State-of-the-art commercial models (Bing and Baidu Translators), with a SacreBLEU score of 16.8 on our test set.Furthermore, an open-source web application has been developed to allow users to translate between Cantonese and English, with the different trained models available for effective comparisons between models from this investigation and users.CANTONMT is available at https://github.com/kenrickkung/CantoneseTranslation</p>

                  <p>Enzymes are genetically encoded biocatalysts capable of accelerating chemical reactions.How can we automatically design functional enzymes?In this paper, we propose EnzyGen, an approach to learn a unified model to design enzymes across all functional families.Our key idea is to generate an enzyme's amino acid sequence and their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates based on functionally important sites and substrates corresponding to a desired catalytic function.These sites are automatically mined from enzyme databases.EnzyGen consists of a novel interleaving network of attention and neighborhood equivariant layers, which captures both long-range correlation in an entire protein sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in 3D space.To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Experimental results show that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity.These findings demonstrate EnzyGen's superior capability in designing well-folded and effective enzymes binding to specific substrates with high affinities.</p>

Financial success, a critical aspect of all individual's well-being, is a complex concept influenced by a plethora of different factors.This study aims to understand the true determinants of financial success.It examines the survey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics[1], consisting of a sample of 8,984 individuals's longitudinal data over years.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises income variables and a large set of socioeconomic variables of individuals.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>An in-depth analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in financial success research, highlights the potential of leveraging longitudinal data to enhance prediction accuracy, and provides valuable insights into how various socioeconomic factors influence financial success.   The findings underscore the significant influence of highest education degree, occupation and gender as the top three determinants of individual income among socioeconomic factors examined.Yearly working hours, age and work tenure emerge as three secondary influencing factors, and all other factors including parental household income, industry, parents' highest grade and others are identified as tertiary factors.   These insights allow researchers to better understand the complex nature of financial success and enable policymakers to grasp the underlying dynamics shaping aspirations, decision-making, and the broader socio-economic fabric of society.This comprehension is crucial for fostering financial success among individuals and advancing broader societal well-being.</p>

                  <p>Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model "naturalness" or "acceptability" of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences.Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text.To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi (en-hi) code-mixed text.Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media.Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset.Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models trained solely on code-mixing metrics are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs).Specifically, XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations in challenging data settings.Comparison with ChatGPT's zero and fewshot capabilities shows that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks.Zero-shot transfer from English-Hindi to English-Telugu acceptability judgments using our model checkpoints proves superior to random baselines, enabling application to other code-mixed language pairs and providing further avenues of research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release our human-annotated dataset, trained checkpoints, code-mix corpus, and code for data generation and model training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.943</span></span></p>

                  <p>Buildings, as fundamental man-made structures in urban environments, serve as crucial indicators for understanding various city function zones.Rapid urbanization has raised an urgent need for efficiently surveying building footprints and functions.In this study, we proposed a semi-supervised framework to identify every building's function in large-scale urban areas with multi-modality remote-sensing data.In detail, optical images, building height, and nighttime-light data are collected to describe the morphological attributes of buildings.Then, the area of interest (AOI) and building masks from the volunteered geographic information (VGI) data are collected to form sparsely labeled samples.Furthermore, the multi-modality data and weak labels are utilized to train a segmentation model with a semi-supervised strategy.Finally, results are evaluated by 20,000 validation points and statistical survey reports from the government.The evaluations reveal that the produced function maps achieve an OA of 82% and Kappa of 71% among 1,616,796 buildings in Shanghai, China.This study has the potential to support large-scale urban management and sustainable urban development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All collected data and produced maps are open access at https://github.com/LiZhuoHong/BuildingMap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate.Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set.Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30.Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set.In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias.Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets.Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.</p>

                  <p>Objective: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language processing techniques.Materials and Methods: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs.The lexicon was further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human evaluation.These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) dataset.For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used to supervised learning classifiers.Results:Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels lexicon containing 127 expressions.Classifiers for doubt markers and stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of .84 and .79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from .71 to .86, and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (.87).Discussion:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text, and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Additional labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.Conclusions: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.</p>

                  <p>This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting.Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners.However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons.First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency.Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited.In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions.To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes.Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes.Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP.By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance.Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p>

                  <p>Image-guided depth completion aims at generating a dense depth map from sparse LiDAR data and RGB image.Recent methods have shown promising performance by reformulating it as a classification problem with two sub-tasks: depth discretization and probability prediction.They divide the depth range into several discrete depth values as depth categories, serving as priors for scene depth distributions.However, previous depth discretization methods are easy to be impacted by depth distribution variations across different scenes, resulting in suboptimal scene depth distribution priors.To address the above problem, we propose a progressive depth decoupling and modulating network, which incrementally decouples the depth range into bins and adaptively generates multi-scale dense depth maps in multiple stages.Specifically, we first design a Bins Initializing Module (BIM) to construct the seed bins by exploring the depth distribution information within a sparse depth map, adapting variations of depth distribution.Then, we devise an incremental depth decoupling branch to progressively refine the depth distribution information from global to local.Meanwhile, an adaptive depth modulating branch is developed to progressively improve the probability representation from coarse-grained to fine-grained.And the bi-directional information interactions are proposed to strengthen the information interaction between those two branches (sub-tasks) for promoting information complementation in each branch.Further, we introduce a multi-scale supervision mechanism to learn the depth distribution information in latent features and enhance the adaptation capability across different scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>The code will be open-sourced at [this https URL](https://github.com/Cisse-away/PDDM).</p>

                  <p>Contrastive learning has been effectively applied to alleviate the data sparsity issue and enhance recommendation performance.The majority of existing methods employ random augmentation to generate augmented views of original sequences.The learning objective then aims to minimize the distance between representations of different views for the same user.However, these random augmentation strategies (e.g., mask or substitution) neglect the semantic consistency of different augmented views for the same user, leading to semantically inconsistent sequences with similar representations.Furthermore, most augmentation methods fail to utilize context information, which is critical for understanding sequence semantics.To address these limitations, we introduce a diffusion-based contrastive learning approach for sequential recommendation.Specifically, given a user sequence, we first select some positions and then leverage context information to guide the generation of alternative items via a guided diffusion model.By repeating this approach, we can get semantically consistent augmented views for the same user, which are used to improve the effectiveness of contrastive learning.To maintain cohesion between the representation spaces of both the diffusion model and the recommendation model, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end fashion with shared item embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span></p>

                  <p>Many applications require efficient management of large sets of intervals because many objects are associated with intervals (e.g., time and price intervals).In such interval management systems, range search is a primitive operator for retrieving and analysis tasks.As dataset sizes are growing nowadays, range search results are also becoming larger, which may overwhelm users and incur long computation time.Because applications are usually satisfied with a subset of the result set, it is desirable to efficiently obtain only small samples from the result set.We therefore address the problem of independent range sampling on interval data, which outputs $s$ random samples that overlap a given query interval and are independent of the samples of all previous queries.To efficiently solve this problem theoretically and practically, we propose a variant of an interval tree, namely the augmented interval tree (or AIT), and we show that there exists an exact algorithm that needs $O(n \log n)$ space and $O(\log^{2} n + s)$ time, where $n$ is the dataset size.The simple structure of an AIT provides flexible extensions: (i) its time and space complexities respectively become $O(\log^{2} n + s)$ expected and $O(n)$ by bucketing intervals and (ii) it can deal with weighted intervals and outputs $s$ weighted random samples in $O(\log^{2} n+s\log n)$ time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets, and the results demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) has emerged as a means to learn new classes incrementally without catastrophic forgetting of previous classes.Recently, CIL has undergone a paradigm shift towards dynamic architectures due to their superior performance.However, these models are still limited by the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation (DA), which are tightly coupled with CIL, remains under-explored in dynamic architecture scenarios.(ii) Feature representation.The discriminativeness of dynamic feature are sub-optimal and possess potential for refinement.(iii) Classifier.The misalignment between dynamic feature and classifier constrains the capabilities of the model.To tackle the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose the Dynamic Feature Learning and Matching (DFLM) model in this paper from above three perspectives.Specifically, we firstly introduce class weight information and non-stationary functions to extend the mix DA method for dynamically adjusting the focus on memory during training.Then, von Mises-Fisher (vMF) classifier is employed to effectively model the dynamic feature distribution and implicitly learn their discriminative properties.Finally, the matching loss is proposed to facilitate the alignment between the learned dynamic features and the classifier by minimizing the distribution distance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on CIL benchmarks validate that our proposed model achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has been recognized as a method to enhance prediction accuracy in various downstream tasks.However, its efficacy for DNA sequences remains somewhat constrained.This limitation stems primarily from the fact that most existing SSP approaches in genomics focus on masked language modeling of individual sequences, neglecting the crucial aspect of encoding statistics across multiple sequences.To overcome this challenge, we introduce an innovative deep neural network model, which incorporates collaborative learning between a `student' and a `teacher' subnetwork.In this model, the student subnetwork employs masked learning on nucleotides and progressively adapts its parameters to the teacher subnetwork through an exponential moving average approach.Concurrently, both subnetworks engage in contrastive learning, deriving insights from two augmented representations of the input sequences.This self-distillation process enables our model to effectively assimilate both contextual information from individual sequences and distributional data across the sequence population.We validated our approach with preliminary pretraining using the human reference genome, followed by applying it to 20 downstream inference tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results from these experiments demonstrate that our novel method significantly boosts inference performance across the majority of these tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/wiedersehne/FinDNA.</p>

                  <p>Integrating the different data modalities of cancer patients can significantly improve the predictive performance of patient survival.However, most existing methods ignore the simultaneous utilization of rich semantic features at different scales in pathology images.When collecting multimodal data and extracting features, there is a likelihood of encountering intra-modality missing data, introducing noise into the multimodal data.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new end-to-end framework, FORESEE, for robustly predicting patient survival by mining multimodal information.Specifically, the cross-fusion transformer effectively utilizes features at the cellular level, tissue level, and tumor heterogeneity level to correlate prognosis through a cross-scale feature cross-fusion method.This enhances the ability of pathological image feature representation.Secondly, the hybrid attention encoder (HAE) uses the denoising contextual attention module to obtain the contextual relationship features and local detail features of the molecular data.HAE's channel attention module obtains global features of molecular data.Furthermore, to address the issue of missing information within modalities, we propose an asymmetrically masked triplet masked autoencoder to reconstruct lost information within modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets in both complete and missing settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Decentralized learning (DL) faces increased vulnerability to privacy breaches due to sophisticated attacks on machine learning (ML) models.Secure aggregation is a computationally efficient cryptographic technique that enables multiple parties to compute an aggregate of their private data while keeping their individual inputs concealed from each other and from any central aggregator.To enhance communication efficiency in DL, sparsification techniques are used, selectively sharing only the most crucial parameters or gradients in a model, thereby maintaining efficiency without notably compromising accuracy.However, applying secure aggregation to sparsified models in DL is challenging due to the transmission of disjoint parameter sets by distinct nodes, which can prevent masks from canceling out effectively.This paper introduces CESAR, a novel secure aggregation protocol for DL designed to be compatible with existing sparsification mechanisms.CESAR provably defends against honest-but-curious adversaries and can be formally adapted to counteract collusion between them.We provide a foundational understanding of the interaction between the sparsification carried out by the nodes and the proportion of the parameters shared under CESAR in both colluding and non-colluding environments, offering analytical insight into the working and applicability of the protocol.Experiments on a network with 48 nodes in a 3-regular topology show that with random subsampling, CESAR is always within 0.5% accuracy of decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent (D-PSGD), while adding only 11% of data overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it surpasses the accuracy on TopK by up to 0.3% on independent and identically distributed (IID) data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

The matrix sketching problem becomes particularly interesting in the context of sliding windows, where the goal is to approximate the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}_W$, formed by input vectors over the most recent $N$ time units.However, despite recent efforts, whether achieving the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound on sliding windows is possible has remained an open question.

                  <p>The scale-up of autonomous vehicles depends heavily on their ability to deal with anomalies, such as rare objects on the road.In order to handle such situations, it is necessary to detect anomalies in the first place.Anomaly detection for autonomous driving has made great progress in the past years but suffers from poorly designed benchmarks with a strong focus on camera data.In this work, we propose AnoVox, the largest benchmark for ANOmaly detection in autonomous driving to date.AnoVox incorporates large-scale multimodal sensor data and spatial VOXel ground truth, allowing for the comparison of methods independent of their used sensor.We propose a formal definition of normality and provide a compliant training dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AnoVox is the first benchmark to contain both content and temporal anomalies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large-scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI).To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed.It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process.The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation.It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation.The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making.Our contributions are two folder.First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection.Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations.The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance.However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes.It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance.To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them.We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence.We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

Our primary upper bound is a deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm (using $\tilde{O}(n)$ space for $n$-node graphs, where $\tilde{O}(.)$ hides polylog$(n)$ factors) for decomposing a tournament into strongly connected components (SCC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>it improves upon the previously best-known algorithm by Baweja, Jia, and Woodruff <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>[ITCS'22] in terms of both space and passes: for $p\geq 1$, they used $(p+1)$-passes and $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/p})$-space.We further extend our algorithm to digraphs that are close to tournaments and establish tight bounds demonstrating that the problem's complexity grows smoothly with the "distance" from tournaments.Applying our framework, we obtain improved tournament algorithms for $s,t$-reachability, strong connectivity, Hamiltonian paths and cycles, and feedback arc set.   On the other hand, we prove the first $\Omega(n^2)$-space lower bounds for this class, exhibiting that some well-studied problems -- such as (exact) feedback arc set on tournaments (FAST) and $s,t$-distance -- remain hard here.We obtain a generalized lower bound on space-approximation tradeoffs for FAST: any single-pass $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm requires $\Omega(n/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ space.As a whole, our collection of results contributes significantly to the growing literature on streaming digraphs.</p>

Conclusion: Our study indicates the effectiveness of reducing ranking errors for classifier-based effort-aware defect prediction.We recommend using EA-Z with imbalanced ensemble learning.</p>

                  <p>Parallel computing is very important to accelerate the performance of software systems.Additionally, considering that a recurring challenge is to process high data volumes continuously, stream processing emerged as a paradigm and software architectural style.Several software systems rely on stream processing to deliver scalable performance, whereas open-source frameworks provide coding abstraction and high-level parallel computing.Although stream processing's performance is being extensively studied, the measurement of fault tolerance--a key abstraction offered by stream processing frameworks--has still not been adequately measured with comprehensive testbeds.In this work, we extend the previous fault recovery measurements with an exploratory analysis of the configuration space, additional experimental measurements, and analysis of improvement opportunities.We focus on robust deployment setups inspired by requirements for near real-time analytics of a large cloud observability platform.The results indicate significant potential for improving fault recovery and performance.However, these improvements entail grappling with configuration complexities, particularly in identifying and selecting the configurations to be fine-tuned and determining the appropriate values for them.Therefore, new abstractions for transparent configuration tuning are also needed for large-scale industry setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that more software engineering efforts are needed to provide insights into potential abstractions and how to achieve them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The stream processing community and industry practitioners could also benefit from more interactions with the high-level parallel programming community, whose expertise and insights on making parallel programming more productive and efficient could be extended.</p>

                  <p>The IoT and Business Process Management (BPM) communities co-exist in many shared application domains, such as manufacturing and healthcare.The IoT community has a strong focus on hardware, connectivity and data; the BPM community focuses mainly on finding, controlling, and enhancing the structured interactions among the IoT devices in processes.While the field of Process Mining deals with the extraction of process models and process analytics from process event logs, the data produced by IoT sensors often is at a lower granularity than these process-level events.The fundamental questions about extracting and abstracting process-related data from streams of IoT sensor values are: (1) Which sensor values can be clustered together as part of process events?, (2) Which sensor values signify the start and end of such events?, (3) Which sensor values are related but not essential?This work proposes a framework to semi-automatically perform a set of structured steps to convert low-level IoT sensor data into higher-level process events that are suitable for process mining.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework is meant to provide a generic sequence of abstract steps to guide the event extraction, abstraction, and correlation, with variation points for plugging in specific analysis techniques and algorithms for each step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>To assess the completeness of the framework, we present a set of challenges, how they can be tackled through the framework, and an example on how to instantiate the framework in a real-world demonstration from the field of smart manufacturing.Based on this framework, future research can be conducted in a structured manner through refining and improving individual steps.</p>

                  <p>It seems that in the current age, computers, computation, and data have an increasingly important role to play in scientific research and discovery.This is reflected in part by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have become great areas of interest not just for computer science but also for many other fields of study.More generally, there have been trends moving towards the use of bigger, more complex and higher capacity models.It also seems that stochastic models, and stochastic variants of existing deterministic models, have become important research directions in various fields.For all of these types of models, gradient-based optimization remains as the dominant paradigm for model fitting, control, and more.This dissertation considers unconstrained, nonlinear optimization problems, with a focus on the gradient itself, that key quantity which enables the solution of such problems.   In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of reverse differentiation, a term which describes the body of techniques which enables the efficient computation of gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We cover relevant techniques both in the deterministic and stochastic cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We present a new framework for calculating the gradient of problems which involve both deterministic and stochastic elements.In chapter 2, we analyze the properties of the gradient estimator, with a focus on those properties which are typically assumed in convergence proofs of optimization algorithms.Chapter 3 gives various examples of applying our new gradient estimator.We further explore the idea of working with piecewise continuous models, that is, models with distinct branches and if statements which define what specific branch to use.</p>

                  <p>Linking (aligning) biomedical concepts across diverse data sources enables various integrative analyses, but it is challenging due to the discrepancies in concept naming conventions.Various strategies have been developed to overcome this challenge, such as those based on string-matching rules, manually crafted thesauri, and machine learning models.However, these methods are constrained by limited prior biomedical knowledge and can hardly generalize beyond the limited amounts of rules, thesauri, or training samples.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive results in diverse biomedical NLP tasks due to their unprecedentedly rich prior knowledge and strong zero-shot prediction abilities.However, LLMs suffer from issues including high costs, limited context length, and unreliable predictions.In this research, we propose PromptLink, a novel biomedical concept linking framework that leverages LLMs.It first employs a biomedical-specialized pre-trained language model to generate candidate concepts that can fit in the LLM context windows.Then it utilizes an LLM to link concepts through two-stage prompts, where the first-stage prompt aims to elicit the biomedical prior knowledge from the LLM for the concept linking task and the second-stage prompt enforces the LLM to reflect on its own predictions to further enhance their reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results on the concept linking task between two EHR datasets and an external biomedical KG demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptLink. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, PromptLink is a generic framework without reliance on additional prior knowledge, context, or training data, making it well-suited for concept linking across various types of data sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/constantjxyz/PromptLink.</p>

Next, we show how to construct (i) a secret sharing scheme with no-signaling certified deletion for any monotone access structure, and (ii) a threshold secret sharing scheme with adaptive certified deletion.Our first construction uses Bartusek and Khurana's (CRYPTO 2023) 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme with certified deletion as a building block, while our second construction is built from scratch and requires several new technical ideas.For example, we significantly generalize the ``XOR extractor'' of Agarwal, Bartusek, Khurana, and Kumar (EUROCRYPT 2023) in order to obtain high rate seedless extraction from certain quantum sources of entropy.</p>

                  <p>The off-policy learning paradigm allows for recommender systems and general ranking applications to be framed as decision-making problems, where we aim to learn decision policies that optimize an unbiased offline estimate of an online reward metric.With unbiasedness comes potentially high variance, and prevalent methods exist to reduce estimation variance.These methods typically make use of control variates, either additive (i.e., baseline corrections or doubly robust methods) or multiplicative (i.e., self-normalisation).Our work unifies these approaches by proposing a single framework built on their equivalence in learning scenarios.The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates.Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it.This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors.Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs.To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN).Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner.Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources.Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments.Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Aligning machine learning systems with human expectations is mostly attempted by training with manually vetted human behavioral samples, typically explicit feedback.This is done on a population level since the context that is capturing the subjective Point-Of-View (POV) of a concrete person in a specific situational context is not retained in the data.However, we argue that alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably.Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed differently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent reasoning processes and observable reactions differ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>We hypothesize that individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an individual level.We test this, by integrating perception information into machine learning systems and measuring their predictive performance wrt.~individual subjective assessments.For our empirical study, we collect a novel data set of multimodal stimuli and corresponding eye tracking sequences for the novel task of Perception-Guided Crossmodal Entailment and tackle it with our Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer.Our findings suggest that exploiting individual perception signals for the machine learning of subjective human assessments provides a valuable cue for individual alignment.It does not only improve the overall predictive performance from the point-of-view of the individual user but might also contribute to steering AI systems towards every person's individual expectations and values.</p>

                  <p>Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques.However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance.In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases.Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results.To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs.In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images.This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization.Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely.The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively.This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks.It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.591</span></span></p>

                  <p>Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances in image quality assessment (IQA).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the underlying reasons for their success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its efficient approximations.On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest.Thus, we believe that saliency plays a crucial role in human perception.In this work, we conduct an empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter.Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA methods.All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of publication.</p>

                  <p>The surgical intervention is crucial to patient healthcare, and many studies have developed advanced algorithms to provide understanding and decision-making assistance for surgeons.Despite great progress, these algorithms are developed for a single specific task and scenario, and in practice require the manual combination of different functions, thus limiting the applicability.Thus, an intelligent and versatile surgical assistant is expected to accurately understand the surgeon's intentions and accordingly conduct the specific tasks to support the surgical process.In this work, by leveraging advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose a Versatile Surgery Assistant (VS-Assistant) that can accurately understand the surgeon's intention and complete a series of surgical understanding tasks, e.g., surgical scene analysis, surgical instrument detection, and segmentation on demand.Specifically, to achieve superior surgical multimodal understanding, we devise a mixture of projectors (MOP) module to align the surgical MLLM in VS-Assistant to balance the natural and surgical knowledge.Moreover, we devise a surgical Function-Calling Tuning strategy to enable the VS-Assistant to understand surgical intentions, and thus make a series of surgical function calls on demand to meet the needs of the surgeons.Extensive experiments on neurosurgery data confirm that our VS-Assistant can understand the surgeon's intention more accurately than the existing MLLM, resulting in overwhelming performance in textual analysis and visual tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code and models will be made public. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span></p>
