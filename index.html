                  <p>Cross-view person matching and 3D human pose estimation in multi-camera networks are particularly difficult when the cameras are extrinsically uncalibrated.Existing efforts generally require large amounts of 3D data for training neural networks or known camera poses for geometric constraints to solve the problem.However, camera poses and 3D data annotation are usually expensive and not always available.We present a method, PME, that solves the two tasks without requiring either information.Our idea is to address cross-view person matching as a clustering problem using each person as a cluster center, then obtain correspondences from person matches, and estimate 3D human poses through multi-view triangulation and bundle adjustment.We solve the clustering problem by introducing a "size constraint" using the number of cameras and a "source constraint" using the fact that two people from the same camera view should not match, to narrow the solution space to a small feasible region.The 2D human poses used in clustering are obtained through a pre-trained 2D pose detector, so our method does not require expensive 3D training data for each new scene.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We extensively evaluate our method on three open datasets and two indoor and outdoor datasets collected using arbitrarily set cameras. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>Our method outperforms other methods by a large margin on cross-view person matching, reaches SOTA performance on 3D human pose estimation without using either camera poses or 3D training data, and shows good generalization ability across five datasets of various environment settings.</p>

                  <p>Researches indicate that text-dependent speaker verification (TD-SV) often outperforms text-independent verification (TI-SV) in short speech scenarios.However, collecting large-scale fixed text speech data is challenging, and as speech length increases, factors like sentence rhythm and pauses affect TDSV's sensitivity to text sequence.Based on these factors, We propose the hypothesis that strategies such as more fine-grained pooling methods on time scales and decoupled representations of speech speaker embedding and text embedding are more suitable for TD-SV.We have introduced an end-to-end TD-SV system based on a dataset comprising longer Chinese numerical string texts.It contains a text embedding network, a speaker embedding network, and back-end fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we recorded a dataset consisting of long Chinese numerical text named SHAL, which is publicly available on the Open-SLR website. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.896</span></span>We addressed the issue of dataset scarcity by augmenting it using Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN.Next, we introduced a dual representation of speech with text embedding and speaker embedding.In the text embedding network, we employed an enhanced Transformer and introduced a triple loss that includes text classification loss, CTC loss, and decoder loss.For the speaker embedding network, we enhanced a sliding window attentive statistics pooling (SWASP), combined with attentive statistics pooling (ASP) to create a multi-scale pooling method.Finally, we fused text embedding and speaker embedding.Our pooling methods achieved an equal error rate (EER) performance improvement of 49.2% on Hi-Mia and 75.0% on SHAL, respectively.</p>

                  <p>This paper proposes an assistive system for architects that converts a large-scale point cloud into a standardized digital representation of a building for Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications.The process is known as Scan-to-BIM, which requires many hours of manual work even for a single building floor by a professional architect.Given its challenging nature, the paper focuses on helping architects on the Scan-to-BIM process, instead of replacing them.Concretely, we propose an assistive Scan-to-BIM system that takes the raw sensor data and edit history (including the current BIM model), then auto-regressively predicts a sequence of model editing operations as APIs of a professional BIM software (i.e., Autodesk Revit).The paper also presents the first building-scale Scan2BIM dataset that contains a sequence of model editing operations as the APIs of Autodesk Revit.The dataset contains 89 hours of Scan2BIM modeling processes by professional architects over 16 scenes, spanning over 35,000 m^2.We report our system's reconstruction quality with standard metrics, and we introduce a novel metric that measures how natural the order of reconstructed operations is.A simple modification to the reconstruction module helps improve performance, and our method is far superior to two other baselines in the order metric.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release data, code, and models at a-scan2bim.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, short videos (SVs) are essential to information acquisition and sharing in our life.The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of emotion recognition in SVs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations.In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling.Some commonly used videos (e.g., facial expressions and postures) have been well studied.However, it is still challenging to understand the emotions in SVs.Since the enhanced content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists information gaps caused by the emotion incompleteness under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions.To tackle these problems, we present an end-to-end baseline method AV-CPNet that employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations.We further design the two-stage cross-modal fusion module to complementarily model the correlations of audio-visual features.The EP-CE Loss, incorporating three emotion polarities, is then applied to guide model optimization.Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the effectiveness of AV-CPNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Datasets and code will be open on https://github.com/XuecWu/eMotions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs).Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps.In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans.However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored.This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs.``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios.AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance.We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks.The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples.For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, our AlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with other state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and dataset will be available at \href{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}{https://github.com/yangzhch6/AlignCoT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of large multi-modal models (LMMs), efficient modality alignment is crucial yet often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality image-text data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this bottleneck, we introduce the ShareGPT4V dataset, a pioneering large-scale resource featuring 1.2 million highly descriptive captions, which surpasses existing datasets in diversity and information content, covering world knowledge, object properties, spatial relationships, and aesthetic evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Specifically, ShareGPT4V originates from a curated 100K high-quality captions collected from advanced GPT4-Vision and has been expanded to 1.2M with a superb caption model trained on this subset.ShareGPT4V first demonstrates its effectiveness for the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, by substituting an equivalent quantity of detailed captions in existing SFT datasets with a subset of our high-quality captions, significantly enhancing the LMMs like LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-1.5-13B, and Qwen-VL-Chat-7B on the MME and MMBench benchmarks, with respective gains of 222.8/22.0/22.3 and 2.7/1.3/1.5.We further incorporate ShareGPT4V data into both the pre-training and SFT phases, obtaining ShareGPT4V-7B, a superior LMM based on a simple architecture that has remarkable performance across a majority of the multi-modal benchmarks.This project is available at https://ShareGPT4V.github.io to serve as a pivotal resource for advancing the LMMs community.</p>

                  <p>Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of essential nutrients.Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and processing.However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart agriculture.   In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp.By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies.We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code and models will be released at https://github.com/hellodfan/AI4GrainInsp. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.946</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, short videos (SVs) are essential to information acquisition and sharing in our life.The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of emotion recognition in SVs.Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling.Some commonly used videos (e.g., facial expressions and postures) have been well studied.However, it is still challenging to understand the emotions in SVs.Since the enhanced content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists information gaps caused by the emotion incompleteness under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions.To tackle these problems, we present an end-to-end baseline method AV-CPNet that employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations.We further design the two-stage cross-modal fusion module to complementarily model the correlations of audio-visual features.The EP-CE Loss, incorporating three emotion polarities, is then applied to guide model optimization.Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the effectiveness of AV-CPNet.Datasets and code will be open on https://github.com/XuecWu/eMotions.</p>

                  <p>Modern personalized recommendation services often rely on user feedback, either explicit or implicit, to improve the quality of services.Explicit feedback refers to behaviors like ratings, while implicit feedback refers to behaviors like user clicks.However, in the scenario of full-screen video viewing experiences like Tiktok and Reels, the click action is absent, resulting in unclear feedback from users, hence introducing noises in modeling training.Existing approaches on de-noising recommendation mainly focus on positive instances while ignoring the noise in a large amount of sampled negative feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method to annotate the unlabeled data from loss and gradient perspectives, which considers the noises in both positive and negative instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Specifically, we first propose an Inverse Dual Loss (IDL) to boost the true label learning and prevent the false label learning.Then we further propose an Inverse Gradient (IG) method to explore the correct updating gradient and adjust the updating based on meta-learning.Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both benchmark and industrial datasets where our proposed method can significantly improve AUC by 9.25% against state-of-the-art methods.Further analysis verifies the proposed inverse learning framework is model-agnostic and can improve a variety of recommendation backbones.The source code, along with the best hyper-parameter settings, is available at this link: https://github.com/Guanyu-Lin/InverseLearning.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found vulnerable to backdoor attacks, raising security concerns about their deployment in mission-critical applications.There are various approaches to detect backdoor attacks, however they all make certain assumptions about the target attack to be detected and require equal and huge numbers of clean and backdoor samples for training, which renders these detection methods quite limiting in real-world circumstances.   This study proposes a novel one-class classification framework called One-class Graph Embedding Classification (OCGEC) that uses GNNs for model-level backdoor detection with only a little amount of clean data.First, we train thousands of tiny models as raw datasets from a small number of clean datasets.Following that, we design a ingenious model-to-graph method for converting the model's structural details and weight features into graph data.We then pre-train a generative self-supervised graph autoencoder (GAE) to better learn the features of benign models in order to detect backdoor models without knowing the attack strategy.After that, we dynamically combine the GAE and one-class classifier optimization goals to form classification boundaries that distinguish backdoor models from benign models.   Our OCGEC combines the powerful representation capabilities of graph neural networks with the utility of one-class classification techniques in the field of anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In comparison to other baselines, it achieves AUC scores of more than 98% on a number of tasks, which far exceeds existing methods for detection even when they rely on a huge number of positive and negative samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Our pioneering application of graphic scenarios for generic backdoor detection can provide new insights that can be used to improve other backdoor defense tasks.Code is available at https://github.com/jhy549/OCGEC.</p>

Surprisingly, it is still possible to compute meaningful approximations in this challenging regime.Nevertheless, in almost all previous work, truly sublinear running time of $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ (for a constant $\varepsilon > 0$) comes at the price of at least polynomial gap $K \ge k \cdot n^{\Omega(\varepsilon)}$. Only recently, [Bringmann, Cassis, Fischer, and Nakos; STOC'22] broke through this barrier and solved the sub-polynomial $(k, k^{1+o(1)})$-gap edit distance problem in time $O(n/k + k^{4+o(1)})$, which is truly sublinear if $n^{\Omega(1)} \le k \le n^{\frac14-\Omega(1)}$.The $n/k$ term is inevitable (already for Hamming distance), but it remains an important task to optimize the $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ term and, in general, solve the $(k, k^{1+o(1)})$-gap edit distance problem in sublinear-time for larger values of $k$.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we design an improved algorithm for the $(k, k^{1+o(1)})$-gap edit distance problem in sublinear time $O(n/k + k^{2+o(1)})$, yielding a significant quadratic speed-up over the previous $O(n/k + k^{4+o(1)})$-time algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our algorithm is unconditionally almost-optimal (up to subpolynomial factors) in the regime where $k \leq n^{\frac13}$ and improves upon the state of the art for $k \leq n^{\frac12-o(1)}$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent drill boom hole-seeking is a promising technology for enhancing drilling efficiency, mitigating potential safety hazards, and relieving human operators.Most existing intelligent drill boom control methods rely on a hierarchical control framework based on inverse kinematics.However, these methods are generally time-consuming due to the computational complexity of inverse kinematics and the inefficiency of the sequential execution of multiple joints.To tackle these challenges, this study proposes an integrated drill boom control method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL).We develop an integrated drill boom control framework that utilizes a parameterized policy to directly generate control inputs for all joints at each time step, taking advantage of joint posture and target hole information.By formulating the hole-seeking task as a Markov decision process, contemporary mainstream RL algorithms can be directly employed to learn a hole-seeking policy, thus eliminating the need for inverse kinematics solutions and promoting cooperative multi-joint control.To enhance the drilling accuracy throughout the entire drilling process, we devise a state representation that combines Denavit-Hartenberg joint information and preview hole-seeking discrepancy data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of hole-seeking accuracy and time efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

To bridge this dichotomy, we present a context-enhanced relational join and introduce an embedding operator composable with relational operators.This enables hybrid relational and context-rich vector data processing, with algebraic equivalences compatible with relational algebra and corresponding logical and physical optimizations.We investigate model-operator interaction with vector data processing and study the characteristics of the E-join operator.Using an example of string embeddings, we demonstrate enabling hybrid context-enhanced processing on relational join operators with vector embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The importance of holistic optimization, from logical to physical, is demonstrated in an order of magnitude execution time improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation (DD) offers a compelling approach in computer vision, with the goal of condensing extensive datasets into smaller synthetic versions without sacrificing much of the model performance.In this paper, we continue to study the methods for DD, by addressing its conceptually core objective: how to capture the essential representation of extensive datasets in smaller, synthetic forms.   We propose a novel approach utilizing the Wasserstein distance, a metric rooted in optimal transport theory, to enhance distribution matching in DD.Our method leverages the Wasserstein barycenter, offering a geometrically meaningful way to quantify distribution differences and effectively capture the centroid of a set of distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach retains the computational benefits of distribution matching-based methods while achieving new state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>To provide useful prior for learning the images, we embed the synthetic data into the feature space of pretrained classification models to conduct distribution matching.Extensive testing on various high-resolution datasets confirms the effectiveness and adaptability of our method, indicating the promising yet unexplored capabilities of Wasserstein metrics in dataset distillation.</p>

The methodology is experimentally assessed on two feature selection tasks adopting a GA-based MOFS with six objectives (number of selected features, balanced accuracy, F1-Score, variance inflation factor, statistical parity, and equalised odds).The results show the added value of the methodology in the selection of the final subset of features.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of open-source ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Auto ML has enabled developers to harness state-of-the-art ML algorithms with minimal overhead.However, during this accelerated ML development process, said developers may often make sub-optimal design and implementation decisions, leading to the introduction of technical debt that, if not addressed promptly, can have a significant impact on the quality of the ML-based software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers frequently acknowledge these sub-optimal design and development choices through code comments during software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>These comments, which often highlight areas requiring additional work or refinement in the future, are known as self-admitted technical debt (SATD).This paper aims to investigate SATD in ML code by analyzing 318 open-source ML projects across five domains, along with 318 non-ML projects.We detected SATD in source code comments throughout the different project snapshots, conducted a manual analysis of the identified SATD sample to comprehend the nature of technical debt in the ML code, and performed a survival analysis of the SATD to understand the evolution of such debts.We observed: i) Machine learning projects have a median percentage of SATD that is twice the median percentage of SATD in non-machine learning projects.ii) ML pipeline components for data preprocessing and model generation logic are more susceptible to debt than model validation and deployment components.iii) SATDs appear in ML projects earlier in the development process compared to non-ML projects.iv) Long-lasting SATDs are typically introduced during extensive code changes that span multiple files exhibiting low complexity.</p>
