                  <p>One of the major challenges of the twenty-first century is climate change, evidenced by rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increased storm frequency.Accurate temperature forecasting is vital for understanding and mitigating these impacts.Traditional data-driven models often use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but face limitations in parallelization, especially with longer sequences.To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on the FocalNet Transformer architecture.Our Focal modulation Attention Encoder (FATE) framework operates in a multi-tensor format, utilizing tensorized modulation to capture spatial and temporal nuances in meteorological data.Comparative evaluations against existing transformer encoders, 3D CNNs, LSTM, and ConvLSTM models show that FATE excels at identifying complex patterns in temperature data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present a new labeled dataset, the Climate Change Parameter dataset (CCPD), containing 40 years of data from Jammu and Kashmir on seven climate-related parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.889</span></span>Experiments with real-world temperature datasets from the USA, Canada, and Europe show accuracy improvements of 12\%, 23\%, and 28\%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art models.Our CCPD dataset also achieved a 24\% improvement in accuracy.To support reproducible research, we have released the source code and pre-trained FATE model at \href{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}{https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE}.</p>

                  <p>Background: Breast ultrasound is prominently used in diagnosing breast tumors.At present, many automatic systems based on deep learning have been developed to help radiologists in diagnosis.However, training such systems remains challenging because they are usually data-hungry and demand amounts of labeled data, which need professional knowledge and are expensive.Methods: We adopted a triplet network and a self-supervised contrastive learning technique to learn representations from unlabeled breast ultrasound video clips.We further designed a new hard triplet loss to to learn representations that particularly discriminate positive and negative image pairs that are hard to recognize.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also constructed a pretraining dataset from breast ultrasound videos (1,360 videos from 200 patients), which includes an anchor sample dataset with 11,805 images, a positive sample dataset with 188,880 images, and a negative sample dataset dynamically generated from video clips. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we constructed a finetuning dataset, including 400 images from 66 patients. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.925</span></span>We transferred the pretrained network to a downstream benign/malignant classification task and compared the performance with other state-of-the-art models, including three models pretrained on ImageNet and a previous contrastive learning model retrained on our datasets.Results and conclusion: Experiments revealed that our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.952, which is significantly higher than the others.Further, we assessed the dependence of our pretrained model on the number of labeled data and revealed that <100 samples were required to achieve an AUC of 0.901.The proposed framework greatly reduces the demand for labeled data and holds potential for use in automatic breast ultrasound image diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>Large-scale data collection is essential for developing personalized training data, mitigating the shortage of training data, and fine-tuning specialized models.However, creating high-quality datasets quickly and accurately remains a challenge due to annotation errors, the substantial time and costs associated with human labor.To address these issues, we propose Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC), an innovative methodology that automates dataset creation with negligible cost and high efficiency.Taking the image classification task as a starting point, ADC leverages LLMs for the detailed class design and code generation to collect relevant samples via search engines, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation and speeding up the data generation process.Despite these advantages, ADC also encounters real-world challenges such as label errors (label noise) and imbalanced data distributions (label bias).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide open-source software that incorporates existing methods for label error detection, robust learning under noisy and biased data, ensuring a higher-quality training data and more robust model training procedure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we design three benchmark datasets focused on label noise detection, label noise learning, and class-imbalanced learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These datasets are vital because there are few existing datasets specifically for label noise detection, despite its importance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing popular methods on these datasets, thereby facilitating further research in the field.</p>

However, delineating faults with current practices is a labor-intensive activity that requires precise analysis of subsurface imaging data by geophysicists.In this paper, we propose the $\texttt{CRACKS}$ dataset to detect and segment faults in subsurface images by utilizing crowdsourced resources.We leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to obtain fault delineations from sections of the Netherlands North Sea subsurface images from (i) $26$ novices who have no exposure to subsurface data and were shown a video describing and labeling faults, (ii) $8$ practitioners who have previously interacted and worked on subsurface data, (iii) one geophysicist to label $7636$ faults in the region.Note that all novices, practitioners, and the expert segment faults on the same subsurface volume with disagreements between and among the novices and practitioners.Additionally, each fault annotation is equipped with the confidence level of the annotator.The paper provides benchmarks on detecting and segmenting the expert labels, given the novice and practitioner labels.Additional details along with the dataset links and codes are available at $\href{https://alregib.ece.gatech.edu/cracks-crowdsourcing-resources-for-analysis-and-categorization-of-key-subsurface-faults/}{link}$.</p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

FedMoE is composed of two fine-tuning stages.In the first stage, FedMoE simplifies the problem by conducting a heuristic search based on observed activation patterns, which identifies a suboptimal submodel for each client.In the second stage, these submodels are distributed to clients for further training and returned for server aggregating through a novel modular aggregation strategy.Meanwhile, FedMoE progressively adjusts the submodels to optimal through global expert recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous personalized FL methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>In cross-silo federated learning (FL), companies collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing heterogeneous data.Prior related work focused on algorithm development to tackle data heterogeneity.However, the dual problem of coopetition, i.e., FL collaboration and market competition, remains under-explored.This paper studies the FL coopetition using a dynamic two-period game model.In period 1, an incumbent company trains a local model and provides model-based services at a chosen price to users.In period 2, an entrant company enters, and both companies decide whether to engage in FL collaboration and then compete in selling model-based services at different prices to users.Analyzing the two-period game is challenging due to data heterogeneity, and that the incumbent's period one pricing has a temporal impact on coopetition in period 2, resulting in a non-concave problem.To address this issue, we decompose the problem into several concave sub-problems and develop an algorithm that achieves a global optimum.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results on three public datasets show two interesting insights. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>First, FL training brings model performance gain as well as competition loss, and collaboration occurs only when the performance gain outweighs the loss.Second, data heterogeneity can incentivize the incumbent to limit market penetration in period 1 and promote price competition in period 2.</p>

We consider, as performance metrics, the competitive ratio, which compares multiplicatively the cost of the solution to the tree of least cost among all scenarios, as well as the regret, which induces a similar, but additive comparison.For BSTs, we show that the problem is NP-hard across both metrics.We also show how to obtain a tree of competitive ratio $\lceil \log_2(k+1) \rceil$, and we prove that this ratio is optimal.For Huffman Trees, we show that the problem is, likewise, NP-hard across both metrics; we also give an algorithm of regret $\lceil \log_2 k \rceil$, which we show is near-optimal, by proving a lower bound of $\lfloor \log_2 k \rfloor$. Last, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing Pareto-optimal BSTs with respect to their regret, assuming scenarios defined by uniform distributions over the keys.This setting captures, in particular, the first study of fairness in the context of data structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide an experimental evaluation of all algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>To this end, we also provide mixed integer linear program formulation for computing optimal trees.</p>

                  <p>Causal Bayesian networks (CBN) are popular graphical probabilistic models that encode causal relations among variables.Learning their graphical structure from observational data has received a lot of attention in the literature.When there exists no latent (unobserved) confounder, i.e., no unobserved direct common cause of some observed variables, learning algorithms can be divided essentially into two classes: constraint-based and score-based approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The latter are often thought to be more robust than the former and to produce better results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>However, to the best of our knowledge, when variables are discrete, no score-based algorithm is capable of dealing with latent confounders.This paper introduces the first fully score-based structure learning algorithm searching the space of DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) that is capable of identifying the presence of some latent confounders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is justified mathematically and experiments highlight its effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated library for the underlying components of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), along with an algorithm to eliminate bounded grids in KANs.The GPU-accelerated library reduces the computational complexity of Basis Spline (B-spline) evaluation by a factor of $\mathcal{O}$(grid size) compared to existing codes, enabling batch computation for large-scale learning.To overcome the limitations of traditional KANs, we introduce Unbounded KANs (UKANs), which eliminate the need for a bounded grid and a fixed number of B-spline coefficients.To do so, we replace the KAN parameters (B-spline coefficients) with a coefficient generator (CG) model.The inputs to the CG model are designed based on the idea of an infinite symmetric grid extending from negative infinity to positive infinity.The positional encoding of grid group, a sequential collection of B-spline grid indexes, is fed into the CG model, and coefficients are consumed by the efficient implementation (matrix representations) of B-spline functions to generate outputs.We perform several experiments on regression, classification, and generative tasks, which are promising.In particular, UKAN does not require data normalization or a bounded domain for evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our benchmarking results indicate the superior memory and computational efficiency of our library compared to existing codes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are engineered to be robust in contextual understanding and exhibit outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks.However, their considerable size incurs significant computational and storage costs.Modern pruning strategies employ one-shot techniques to compress PLMs without the need for retraining on task-specific or otherwise general data; however, these approaches often lead to an indispensable reduction in performance.In this paper, we propose SDS, a Sparse-Dense-Sparse pruning framework to enhance the performance of the pruned PLMs from a weight distribution optimization perspective.We outline the pruning process in three steps.Initially, we prune less critical connections in the model using conventional one-shot pruning methods.Next, we reconstruct a dense model featuring a pruning-friendly weight distribution by reactivating pruned connections with sparse regularization.Finally, we perform a second pruning round, yielding a superior pruned model compared to the initial pruning.Experimental results demonstrate that SDS outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning techniques SparseGPT and Wanda under an identical sparsity configuration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, SDS reduces perplexity by 9.13 on Raw-Wikitext2 and improves accuracy by an average of 2.05% across multiple zero-shot benchmarks for OPT-125M with 2:4 sparsity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>We study the task of language instruction-guided robotic manipulation, in which an embodied robot is supposed to manipulate the target objects based on the language instructions.In previous studies, the predicted manipulation regions of the target object typically do not change with specification from the language instructions, which means that the language perception and manipulation prediction are separate.However, in human behavioral patterns, the manipulation regions of the same object will change for different language instructions.In this paper, we propose Instruction-Guided Affordance Net (IGANet) for predicting affordance maps of instruction-guided robotic manipulation tasks by utilizing powerful priors from vision and language encoders pre-trained on large-scale datasets.We develop a Vison-Language-Models(VLMs)-based data augmentation pipeline, which can generate a large amount of data automatically for model training.Besides, with the help of Large-Language-Models(LLMs), actions can be effectively executed to finish the tasks defined by instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A series of real-world experiments revealed that our method can achieve better performance with generated data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Moreover, our model can generalize better to scenarios with unseen objects and language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a pivotal approach in decentralized machine learning, especially when data privacy is crucial and direct data sharing is impractical.While FL is typically associated with supervised learning, its potential in unsupervised scenarios is underexplored.This paper introduces a novel unsupervised federated learning methodology designed to identify the complete set of categories (global K) across multiple clients within label-free, non-uniform data distributions, a process known as Federated Clustering.Our approach, Federated Cluster-Wise Refinement (FedCRef), involves clients that collaboratively train models on clusters with similar data distributions.Initially, clients with diverse local data distributions (local K) train models on their clusters to generate compressed data representations.These local models are then shared across the network, enabling clients to compare them through reconstruction error analysis, leading to the formation of federated groups.In these groups, clients collaboratively train a shared model representing each data distribution, while continuously refining their local clusters to enhance data association accuracy.This iterative process allows our system to identify all potential data distributions across the network and develop robust representation models for each.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our approach, we compare it with traditional centralized methods, establishing a performance baseline and showcasing the advantages of our distributed solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>We also conduct experiments on the EMNIST and KMNIST datasets, demonstrating FedCRef's ability to refine and align cluster models with actual data distributions, significantly improving data representation precision in unsupervised federated settings.</p>

                  <p>Novelty detection is a critical task for deploying machine learning models in the open world.A crucial property of novelty detection methods is universality, which can be interpreted as generalization across various distributions of training or test data.More precisely, for novelty detection, distribution shifts may occur in the training set or the test set.Shifts in the training set refer to cases where we train a novelty detector on a new dataset and expect strong transferability.Conversely, distribution shifts in the test set indicate the methods' performance when the trained model encounters a shifted test sample.We experimentally show that existing methods falter in maintaining universality, which stems from their rigid inductive biases.Motivated by this, we aim for more generalized techniques that have more adaptable inductive biases.In this context, we leverage the fact that contrastive learning provides an efficient framework to easily switch and adapt to new inductive biases through the proper choice of augmentations in forming the negative pairs.We propose a novel probabilistic auto-negative pair generation method AutoAugOOD, along with contrastive learning, to yield a universal novelty detector method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method under different distribution shifts in various image benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Notably, our method emerges universality in the lens of adaptability to different setups of novelty detection, including one-class, unlabeled multi-class, and labeled multi-class settings.Code: https://github.com/mojtaba-nafez/UNODE</p>

The proposed U-Net architecture with CNN layers mimics a classical finite element multigrid algorithm.It can be shown that the CNN efficiently approximates all operations required by the solver, including the evaluation of the residual-based error estimator.In the CNN, a culling mask set-up according to the local corrections due to refinement on each mesh level reduces the overall complexity, allowing the network optimization with localized fine-scale finite element data.

To address these issues, we introduce the Generative Compatibility Model (GeCo), a two-stage approach that improves fashion image retrieval through paired image-to-image translation.First, the Complementary Item Generation Model (CIGM), built on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generates target item images (e.g., bottoms) from seed items (e.g., tops), offering conditioning signals for retrieval.These generated samples are then integrated into GeCo, enhancing compatibility modeling and retrieval accuracy.Evaluations on three datasets show that GeCo outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.Key contributions include: (i) the GeCo model utilizing paired image-to-image translation within the Composed Image Retrieval framework, (ii) comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, and (iii) the release of a new Fashion Taobao dataset designed for top-bottom retrieval, promoting further research.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning enables AI models to learn new data sequentially without retraining in real-world scenarios.Most existing methods assume the training data are balanced, aiming to reduce the catastrophic forgetting problem that models tend to forget previously generated data.However, data imbalance and the mixture of new and old data in real-world scenarios lead the model to ignore categories with fewer training samples.To solve this problem, we propose an analytic imbalance rectifier algorithm (AIR), a novel online exemplar-free continual learning method with an analytic (i.e., closed-form) solution for data-imbalanced class-incremental learning (CIL) and generalized CIL scenarios in real-world continual learning.AIR introduces an analytic re-weighting module (ARM) that calculates a re-weighting factor for each class for the loss function to balance the contribution of each category to the overall loss and solve the problem of imbalanced training data.AIR uses the least squares technique to give a non-discriminatory optimal classifier and its iterative update method in continual learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on multiple datasets show that AIR significantly outperforms existing methods in long-tailed and generalized CIL scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/fang-d/AIR.</p>

                  <p>Event Cameras, also known as Neuromorphic sensors, capture changes in local light intensity at the pixel level, producing asynchronously generated data termed ``events''.This distinct data format mitigates common issues observed in conventional cameras, like under-sampling when capturing fast-moving objects, thereby preserving critical information that might otherwise be lost.However, leveraging this data often necessitates the development of specialized, handcrafted event representations that can integrate seamlessly with conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), considering the unique attributes of event data.In this study, We evaluate event-based Face and Eye tracking.The core objective of our study is to showcase the viability of integrating conventional algorithms with event-based data, transformed into a frame format while preserving the unique benefits of event cameras.To validate our approach, we constructed a frame-based event dataset by simulating events between RGB frames derived from the publicly accessible Helen Dataset.We assess its utility for face and eye detection tasks through the application of GR-YOLO -- a pioneering technique derived from YOLOv3.This evaluation includes a comparative analysis with results derived from training the dataset with YOLOv8.Subsequently, the trained models were tested on real event streams from various iterations of Prophesee's event cameras and further evaluated on the Faces in Event Stream (FES) benchmark dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The models trained on our dataset shows a good prediction performance across all the datasets obtained for validation with the best results of a mean Average precision score of 0.91. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Additionally, The models trained demonstrated robust performance on real event camera data under varying light conditions.</p>

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks.LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems.In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora.Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks.Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input.Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data.Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level.Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\%, 64.2\%, and 72.3\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively.Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is fundamental yet, challenging problem with practical applications in industry.The current approaches neglect the higher-order dependencies within the networks of interconnected sensors in the high-dimensional time series(multisensor data) for anomaly detection.To this end, we present a self-adapting anomaly detection framework for joint learning of (a) discrete hypergraph structure and (b) modeling the temporal trends and spatial relations among the interdependent sensors using the hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture to overcome the challenges.The hypergraph representation learning-based framework exploits the relational inductive biases in the hypergraph-structured data to learn the pointwise single-step-ahead forecasts through the self-supervised autoregressive task and predicts the anomalies based on the forecast error.Furthermore, our framework incentivizes learning the anomaly-diagnosis ontology through a differentiable approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It derives the anomaly information propagation-based computational hypergraphs for root cause analysis and provides recommendations through an offline, optimal predictive control policy to remedy an anomaly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.597</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method on the benchmark datasets for fair and rigorous comparison with the popular baselines.The proposed method outperforms the baseline models and achieves SOTA performance.We report the ablation studies to support the efficacy of the framework.</p>

                  <p>LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) demonstrates outstanding accuracy and stability in general low-speed and smooth motion scenarios.However, in high-speed and intense motion scenarios, such as sharp turns, two primary challenges arise: firstly, due to the limitations of IMU frequency, the error in estimating significantly non-linear motion states escalates; secondly, drastic changes in the Field of View (FOV) may diminish the spatial overlap between LiDAR frame and pointcloud map (or between frames), leading to insufficient data association and constraint degradation.   To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive Sliding window LIO framework (AS-LIO) guided by the Spatial Overlap Degree (SOD).Initially, we assess the SOD between the LiDAR frames and the registered map, directly evaluating the adverse impact of current FOV variation on pointcloud alignment.Subsequently, we design an adaptive sliding window to manage the continuous LiDAR stream and control state updates, dynamically adjusting the update step according to the SOD.This strategy enables our odometry to adaptively adopt higher update frequency to precisely characterize trajectory during aggressive FOV variation, thus effectively reducing the non-linear error in positioning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, the historical constraints within the sliding window reinforce the frame-to-map data association, ensuring the robustness of state estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Experiments show that our AS-LIO framework can quickly perceive and respond to challenging FOV change, outperforming other state-of-the-art LIO frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been increasingly investigated for dynamic HVAC control in buildings.However, most studies focus on exploring solutions in online or off-policy scenarios without discussing in detail the implementation feasibility or effectiveness of dealing with purely offline datasets or trajectories.The lack of these works limits the real-world deployment of RL-based HVAC controllers, especially considering the abundance of historical data.To this end, this paper comprehensively evaluates the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by conducting analytical and numerical studies.The analysis is conducted from two perspectives: algorithms and dataset characteristics.As a prerequisite, the necessity of applying offline RL algorithms is first confirmed in two building environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The ability of observation history modeling to reduce violations and enhance performance is subsequently studied. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>Next, the performance of RL-based controllers under datasets with different qualitative and quantitative conditions is investigated, including constraint satisfaction and power consumption.Finally, the sensitivity of certain hyperparameters is also evaluated.The results indicate that datasets of a certain suboptimality level and relatively small scale can be utilized to effectively train a well-performed RL-based HVAC controller.Specifically, such controllers can reduce at most 28.5% violation ratios of indoor temperatures and achieve at most 12.1% power savings compared to the baseline controller.In summary, this paper presents our well-structured investigations and new findings when applying offline reinforcement learning to building HVAC systems.</p>

In this essay, we will first introduce the problem of reliable computation from unreliable components and establish the existence of noise thresholds.We will then provide an exposition of von Neumann's result with 3-input majority gates and extend it to minority gates.We will then provide an introduction to SDPIs, which have many applications, including in statistical mechanics, portfolio theory, and lower bounds on statistical estimation under privacy constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will then use the introduced material to provide an exposition of Polyanskiy and Wu's 2017 result on Bayesian networks, from which the 1999 result of Evans-Schulman follows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning electronic health records (EHRs) has received emerging attention because of its capability to facilitate accurate medical diagnosis.Since the EHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions between entities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice.The EHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, and complexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them.Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning the representations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHR analysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across different tasks.In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHR modeling, namely MulT-EHR (Multi-Task EHR), which leverages a heterogeneous graph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based on the causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects and reduce noise in the EHR data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Additionally, since our model adopts a single graph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design a multi-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularize the training process.Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks -- drug recommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, and readmission.Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of our method upon variations to key components and hyperparameters.</p>

                  <p>Human intelligence is characterized by our ability to absorb and apply knowledge from the world around us, especially in rapidly acquiring new concepts from minimal examples, underpinned by prior knowledge.Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to mimic this capacity by enabling significant generalizations and transferability.However, traditional FSL frameworks often rely on assumptions of clean, complete, and static data, conditions that are seldom met in real-world environments.Such assumptions falter in the inherently uncertain, incomplete, and dynamic contexts of the open world.This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements designed to adapt FSL for use in open-world settings.We categorize existing methods into three distinct types of open-world few-shot learning: those involving varying instances, varying classes, and varying distributions.Each category is discussed in terms of its specific challenges and methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.We standardize experimental settings and metric benchmarks across scenarios, and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various methods.In conclusion, we outline potential future research directions for this evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is our hope that this review will catalyze further development of effective solutions to these complex challenges, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>INTRODUCTION:Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by a decline in cognitive functions beyond typical age and education-related expectations.Since, MCI has been linked to reduced social interactions and increased aimless movements, we aimed to automate the capture of these behaviors to enhance longitudinal monitoring.   METHODS: Using a privacy-preserving distributed camera network, we collected movement and social interaction data from groups of individuals with MCI undergoing therapy within a 1700$m^2$ space.We developed movement and social interaction features, which were then used to train a series of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between higher and lower cognitive functioning MCI groups.   RESULTS:A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between high and low-functioning cohorts in features such as linear path length, walking speed, change in direction while walking, entropy of velocity and direction change, and number of group formations in the indoor space.Despite lacking individual identifiers to associate with specific levels of MCI, a machine learning approach using the most significant features provided a 71% accuracy.   DISCUSSION:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide evidence to show that a privacy-preserving low-cost camera network using edge computing framework has the potential to distinguish between different levels of cognitive impairment from the movements and social interactions captured during group activities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>
