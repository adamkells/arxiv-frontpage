                  <p>Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods.Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content.This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints.Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features.To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design.Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network.This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.923</span></span>Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques.The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Time series data has been demonstrated to be crucial in various research fields.The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network.Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem.This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification.However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain.In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task.Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains.Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms other baselines and learns a condensed synthetic dataset that exhibits desirable characteristics such as conforming to the distribution of the original data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) proficiently allows an agent to tackle novel tasks while solely relying on a static dataset.For precise and efficient task identification, existing OMRL research suggests learning separate task representations that be incorporated with policy input, thus forming a context-based meta-policy.A major approach to train task representations is to adopt contrastive learning using multi-task offline data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset typically encompasses interactions from various policies (i.e., the behavior policies), thus providing a plethora of contextual information regarding different tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Nonetheless, amassing data from a substantial number of policies is not only impractical but also often unattainable in realistic settings.Instead, we resort to a more constrained yet practical scenario, where multi-task data collection occurs with a limited number of policies.We observed that learned task representations from previous OMRL methods tend to correlate spuriously with the behavior policy instead of reflecting the essential characteristics of the task, resulting in unfavorable out-of-distribution generalization.To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm to disentangle the impact of behavior policy from task representation learning through a process called adversarial data augmentation.Specifically, the objective of adversarial data augmentation is not merely to generate data analogous to offline data distribution; instead, it aims to create adversarial examples designed to confound learned task representations and lead to incorrect task identification.Our experiments show that learning from such adversarial samples significantly enhances the robustness and effectiveness of the task identification process and realizes satisfactory out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

                  <p>Event cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors that capture pixel-wise intensity changes and output asynchronous event streams.They show great potential over conventional cameras to handle challenging scenarios in robotics and computer vision, such as high-speed and high dynamic range.This paper considers the problem of rotational motion estimation using event cameras.Several event-based rotation estimation methods have been developed in the past decade, but their performance has not been evaluated and compared under unified criteria yet.In addition, these prior works do not consider a global refinement step.To this end, we conduct a systematic study of this problem with two objectives in mind: summarizing previous works and presenting our own solution.First, we compare prior works both theoretically and experimentally.Second, we propose the first event-based rotation-only bundle adjustment (BA) approach.We formulate it leveraging the state-of-the-art Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework, which is principled and avoids the need to convert events into frames.Third, we use the proposed BA to build CMax-SLAM, the first event-based rotation-only SLAM system comprising a front-end and a back-end.Our BA is able to run both offline (trajectory smoothing) and online (CMax-SLAM back-end).To demonstrate the performance and versatility of our method, we present comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including indoor, outdoor and space scenarios.We discuss the pitfalls of real-world evaluation and propose a proxy for the reprojection error as the figure of merit to evaluate event-based rotation BA methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the source code and novel data sequences to benefit the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>We hope this work leads to a better understanding and fosters further research on event-based ego-motion estimation.Project page: https://github.com/tub-rip/cmax_slam</p>

                  <p>Reflective surfaces present a persistent challenge for reliable 3D mapping and perception in robotics and autonomous systems.However, existing reflection datasets and benchmarks remain limited to sparse 2D data.This paper introduces the first large-scale 3D reflection detection dataset containing more than 50,000 aligned samples of multi-return Lidar, RGB images, and 2D/3D semantic labels across diverse indoor environments with various reflections.Textured 3D ground truth meshes enable automatic point cloud labeling to provide precise ground truth annotations.Detailed benchmarks evaluate three Lidar point cloud segmentation methods, as well as current state-of-the-art image segmentation networks for glass and mirror detection.The proposed dataset advances reflection detection by providing a comprehensive testbed with precise global alignment, multi-modal data, and diverse reflective objects and materials.It will drive future research towards reliable reflection detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is publicly available at http://3dref.github.io <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.967</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough results, opening countless new possibilities for many practical applications.However, LLMs lack elementary safety features that are established norms in other areas of computer science, such as the separation between instructions and data, causing them to malfunction or rendering them vulnerable to manipulation and interference by third parties e.g., via indirect prompt/command injection.Even worse, so far, there is not even an established definition of what precisely such a separation would mean and how its violation could be tested.In this work, we aim to close this gap.We introduce a formal measure to quantify the phenomenon of instruction-data separation as well as an empirical variant of the measure that can be computed from a model`s black-box outputs.We also introduce a new dataset, SEP (Should it be Executed or Processed?), which allows estimating the measure, and we report results on several state-of-the-art open-source and closed LLMs.Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs fail to achieve a high amount of separation, according to our measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and SEP dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/egozverev/Shold-It-Be-Executed-Or-Processed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code understanding and generation have fast become some of the most popular applications of language models (LMs).Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts.In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone.In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages.Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.</p>

                  <p>Echocardiography (echo) is the first imaging modality used when assessing cardiac function.The measurement of functional biomarkers from echo relies upon the segmentation of cardiac structures and deep learning models have been proposed to automate the segmentation process.However, in order to translate these tools to widespread clinical use it is important that the segmentation models are robust to a wide variety of images (e.g. acquired from different scanners, by operators with different levels of expertise etc.).To achieve this level of robustness it is necessary that the models are trained with multiple diverse datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A significant challenge faced when training with multiple diverse datasets is the variation in label presence, i.e. the combined data are often partially-labelled. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Adaptations of the cross entropy loss function have been proposed to deal with partially labelled data.In this paper we show that training naively with such a loss function and multiple diverse datasets can lead to a form of shortcut learning, where the model associates label presence with domain characteristics, leading to a drop in performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, we propose a novel label dropout scheme to break the link between domain characteristics and the presence or absence of labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>We demonstrate that label dropout improves echo segmentation Dice score by 62% and 25% on two cardiac structures when training using multiple diverse partially labelled datasets.</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), also called zero-shot or dataless text classification, has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability in classifying a mass of texts within the dynamic and open Web environment, since it requires only a limited set of seed words (label names) for each category instead of labeled data.With the help of recently popular prompting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), many studies leveraged manually crafted and/or automatically identified verbalizers to estimate the likelihood of categories, but they failed to differentiate the effects of these category-indicative words, let alone capture their correlations and realize adaptive adjustments according to the unlabeled corpus.In this paper, in order to let the PLM effectively understand each category, we at first propose a novel form of rule-based knowledge using logical expressions to characterize the meanings of categories.Then, we develop a prompting PLM-based approach named RulePrompt for the WSTC task, consisting of a rule mining module and a rule-enhanced pseudo label generation module, plus a self-supervised fine-tuning module to make the PLM align with this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, the inaccurate pseudo labels assigned to texts and the imprecise logical rules associated with categories mutually enhance each other in an alternative manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>That establishes a self-iterative closed loop of knowledge (rule) acquisition and utilization, with seed words serving as the starting point.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which markedly outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.What is more, our approach yields interpretable category rules, proving its advantage in disambiguating easily-confused categories.</p>

                  <p>Dysarthria, a common issue among stroke patients, severely impacts speech intelligibility.Inappropriate pauses are crucial indicators in severity assessment and speech-language therapy.We propose to extend a large-scale speech recognition model for inappropriate pause detection in dysarthric speech.To this end, we propose task design, labeling strategy, and a speech recognition model with an inappropriate pause prediction layer.First, we treat pause detection as speech recognition, using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to convert speech into text with pause tags.According to the newly designed task, we label pause locations at the text level and their appropriateness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collaborate with speech-language pathologists to establish labeling criteria, ensuring high-quality annotated data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Finally, we extend the ASR model with an inappropriate pause prediction layer for end-to-end inappropriate pause detection.Moreover, we propose a task-tailored metric for evaluating inappropriate pause detection independent of ASR performance.Our experiments show that the proposed method better detects inappropriate pauses in dysarthric speech than baselines.(Inappropriate Pause Error Rate: 14.47%)</p>

                  <p>Open-set graph learning is a practical task that aims to classify the known class nodes and to identify unknown class samples as unknowns.Conventional node classification methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in open-set scenarios due to the complex data they encounter, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) data and in-distribution (IND) noise.OOD data are samples that do not belong to any known classes.They are outliers if they occur in training (OOD noise), and open-set samples if they occur in testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IND noise are training samples which are assigned incorrect labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>The existence of IND noise and OOD noise is prevalent, which usually cause the ambiguity problem, including the intra-class variety problem and the inter-class confusion problem.Thus, to explore robust open-set learning methods is necessary and difficult, and it becomes even more difficult for non-IID graph data.To this end, we propose a unified framework named ROG$_{PL}$ to achieve robust open-set learning on complex noisy graph data, by introducing prototype learning.In specific, ROG$_{PL}$ consists of two modules, i.e., denoising via label propagation and open-set prototype learning via regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The first module corrects noisy labels through similarity-based label propagation and removes low-confidence samples, to solve the intra-class variety problem caused by noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>The second module learns open-set prototypes for each known class via non-overlapped regions and remains both interior and border prototypes to remedy the inter-class confusion problem.The two modules are iteratively updated under the constraints of classification loss and prototype diversity loss.To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ROG$_{PL}$ is the first robust open-set node classification method for graph data with complex noise.</p>

                  <p>Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods.Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content.This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints.Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features.To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design.Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network.This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features.Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Authorship Verification (AV) is the process of analyzing a set of documents to determine whether they were written by a specific author.This problem often arises in forensic scenarios, e.g., in cases where the documents in question constitute evidence for a crime.Existing state-of-the-art AV methods use computational solutions that are not supported by a plausible scientific explanation for their functioning and that are often difficult for analysts to interpret.To address this, we propose a method relying on calculating a quantity we call $\lambda_G$ (LambdaG): the ratio between the likelihood of a document given a model of the Grammar for the candidate author and the likelihood of the same document given a model of the Grammar for a reference population.These Grammar Models are estimated using $n$-gram language models that are trained solely on grammatical features.Despite not needing large amounts of data for training, LambdaG still outperforms other established AV methods with higher computational complexity, including a fine-tuned Siamese Transformer network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation based on four baseline methods applied to twelve datasets shows that LambdaG leads to better results in terms of both accuracy and AUC in eleven cases and in all twelve cases if considering only topic-agnostic methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>The algorithm is also highly robust to important variations in the genre of the reference population in many cross-genre comparisons.In addition to these properties, we demonstrate how LambdaG is easier to interpret than the current state-of-the-art.We argue that the advantage of LambdaG over other methods is due to fact that it is compatible with Cognitive Linguistic theories of language processing.</p>

                  <p>Transfer learning has recently shown significant performance across various tasks involving deep neural networks.In these transfer learning scenarios, the prior distribution for downstream data becomes crucial in Bayesian model averaging (BMA).While previous works proposed the prior over the neural network parameters centered around the pre-trained solution, such strategies have limitations when dealing with distribution shifts between upstream and downstream data.This paper introduces nonparametric transfer learning (NPTL), a flexible posterior sampling method to address the distribution shift issue within the context of nonparametric learning.The nonparametric learning (NPL) method is a recent approach that employs a nonparametric prior for posterior sampling, efficiently accounting for model misspecification scenarios, which is suitable for transfer learning scenarios that may involve the distribution shift between upstream and downstream tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive empirical validations, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses other baselines in BMA performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>In MaxSAT with Cardinality Constraint problem (CC-MaxSAT), we are given a CNF-formula $\Phi$, and $k \ge 0$, and the goal is to find an assignment $\beta$ with at most $k$ variables set to true (also called a weight $k$-assignment) such that the number of clauses satisfied by $\beta$ is maximized.MaxCov can be seen as a special case of CC-MaxSAT, where the formula $\Phi$ is monotone, i.e., does not contain any negative literals.CC-MaxSAT and MaxCov are extremely well-studied problems in the approximation algorithms as well as parameterized complexity literature.   Our first contribution is that the two problems are equivalent to each other in the context of FPT-Approximation parameterized by $k$ (approximation is in terms of number of clauses satisfied/elements covered).We give a randomized reduction from CC-MaxSAT to MaxCov in time $O(1/\epsilon)^{k} \cdot (m+n)^{O(1)}$ that preserves the approximation guarantee up to a factor of $1-\epsilon$. Furthermore, this reduction also works in the presence of fairness and matroid constraints.   Armed with this reduction, we focus on designing FPT-Approximation schemes (FPT-ASes) for MaxCov and its generalizations.Our algorithms are based on a novel combination of a variety of ideas, including a carefully designed probability distribution that exploits sparse coverage functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These algorithms substantially generalize the results in Jain et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>[SODA 2023] for CC-MaxSAT and MaxCov for $K_{d,d}$-free set systems (i.e., no $d$ sets share $d$ elements), as well as a recent FPT-AS for Matroid-Constrained MaxCov by Sellier [ESA 2023] for frequency-$d$ set systems.</p>

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST).LIST is featured with two novel components.Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance.Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects.Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results.We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>The concept of $k$-defective clique, a relaxation of clique by allowing up-to $k$ missing edges, has been receiving increasing interests recently.Although the problem of finding the maximum $k$-defective clique is NP-hard, several practical algorithms have been recently proposed in the literature, with kDC being the state of the art.kDCnot only runs the fastest in practice, but also achieves the best time complexity.Specifically, it runs in $O^*(\gamma_k^n)$ time when ignoring polynomial factors; here, $\gamma_k$ is a constant that is smaller than two and only depends on $k$, and $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph $G$.In this paper, we propose the kDC-Two algorithm to improve the time complexity as well as practical performance.kDC-Two runs in $O^*( (\alpha\Delta)^{k+2} \gamma_{k-1}^\alpha)$ time when the maximum $k$-defective clique size $\omega_k(G)$ is at least $k+2$, and in $O^*(\gamma_{k-1}^n)$ time otherwise, where $\alpha$ and $\Delta$ are the degeneracy and maximum degree of $G$, respectively.In addition, with slight modification, kDC-Two also runs in $O^*( (\alpha\Delta)^{k+2} (k+1)^{\alpha+k+1-\omega_k(G)})$ time by using the degeneracy gap $\alpha+k+1-\omega_k(G)$ parameterization; this is better than $O^*( (\alpha\Delta)^{k+2}\gamma_{k-1}^\alpha)$ when $\omega_k(G)$ is close to the degeneracy-based upper bound $\alpha+k+1$. Finally, to further improve the practical performance, we propose a new degree-sequence-based reduction rule that can be efficiently applied, and theoretically demonstrate its effectiveness compared with those proposed in the literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical studies on three benchmark graph collections show that our algorithm outperforms the existing fastest algorithm by several orders of magnitude. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents the results of the SHROOM, a shared task focused on detecting hallucinations: outputs from natural language generation (NLG) systems that are fluent, yet inaccurate.Such cases of overgeneration put in jeopardy many NLG applications, where correctness is often mission-critical.The shared task was conducted with a newly constructed dataset of 4000 model outputs labeled by 5 annotators each, spanning 3 NLP tasks: machine translation, paraphrase generation and definition modeling.   The shared task was tackled by a total of 58 different users grouped in 42 teams, out of which 27 elected to write a system description paper; collectively, they submitted over 300 prediction sets on both tracks of the shared task.We observe a number of key trends in how this approach was tackled -- many participants rely on a handful of model, and often rely either on synthetic data for fine-tuning or zero-shot prompting strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While a majority of the teams did outperform our proposed baseline system, the performances of top-scoring systems are still consistent with a random handling of the more challenging items. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>The creation of high-quality human-labeled image-caption datasets presents a significant bottleneck in the development of Visual-Language Models (VLMs).We propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generation models to create synthetic image-text pairs for efficient and effective VLM training.Our method employs pretraining a text-to-image model to synthesize image embeddings starting from captions generated by an LLM.These synthetic pairs are then used to train a VLM.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VLM trained with synthetic data exhibits comparable performance on image captioning, while requiring a fraction of the data used by models trained solely on human-annotated data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we outperform the baseline by 17% through augmentation with a synthetic dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Furthermore, we show that synthesizing in the image embedding space is 25% faster than in the pixel space.This research introduces a promising technique for generating large-scale, customizable image datasets, leading to enhanced VLM performance and wider applicability across various domains, all with improved data efficiency and resource utilization.</p>

                  <p>By using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), knowledge can be transferred from a label-rich source domain to a target domain that contains relevant information but lacks labels.Many existing UDA algorithms suffer from directly using raw images as input, resulting in models that overly focus on redundant information and exhibit poor generalization capability.To address this issue, we attempt to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation by employing the Fourier method (FTF).Specifically, FTF is inspired by the amplitude of Fourier spectra, which primarily preserves low-level statistical information.In FTF, we effectively incorporate low-level information from the target domain into the source domain by fusing the amplitudes of both domains in the Fourier domain.Additionally, we observe that extracting features from batches of images can eliminate redundant information while retaining class-specific features relevant to the task.Building upon this observation, we apply the Fourier Transform at the data stream level for the first time.To further align multiple sources of data, we introduce the concept of correlation alignment.To evaluate the effectiveness of our FTF method, we conducted evaluations on four benchmark datasets for domain adaptation, including Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Caltech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

This completely resolves the question of the minimum size of conditioning sets required to learn the graph.When it comes to the number of tests, our upper bound on the sizes of conditioning sets implies that every $n$-vertex graph can be learned by at most $n^{\kappa}$ tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $\kappa$. We show that for any upper bound $q$ on the sizes of the conditioning sets, there exist graphs with $O(n q)$ vertices that require at least $n^{\Omega(\kappa)}$ tests to learn.This lower bound holds even when the treewidth and the maximum degree of the graph are at most $\kappa+2$. On the positive side, we prove that every graph of bounded treewidth can be learned by a polynomial number of tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $2\kappa$.</p>

Second, some papers don't use a realistic membership base rate, leading to incorrect precision measures if precision is reported.Third, some papers unnecessarily report measures in such a way that it is difficult or impossible to assess risk.Virtually the entire literature on membership inference attacks, dozens of papers, make one or both of these errors.We propose that membership inference papers report precision/recall values using a representative range of base rates.</p>

                  <p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer an agent's preferences (represented as a reward function $R$) from their behaviour (represented as a policy $\pi$).To do this, we need a behavioural model of how $\pi$ relates to $R$. In the current literature, the most common behavioural models are optimality, Boltzmann-rationality, and causal entropy maximisation.However, the true relationship between a human's preferences and their behaviour is much more complex than any of these behavioural models.This means that the behavioural models are misspecified, which raises the concern that they may lead to systematic errors if applied to real data.In this paper, we analyse how sensitive the IRL problem is to misspecification of the behavioural model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that completely characterise how the observed data may differ from the assumed behavioural model without incurring an error above a given threshold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>In addition to this, we also characterise the conditions under which a behavioural model is robust to small perturbations of the observed policy, and we analyse how robust many behavioural models are to misspecification of their parameter values (such as e.g.\ the discount rate).Our analysis suggests that the IRL problem is highly sensitive to misspecification, in the sense that very mild misspecification can lead to very large errors in the inferred reward function.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are notoriously miscalibrated, i.e., their outputs do not reflect the true probability of the event we aim to predict.While networks for tabular or image data are usually overconfident, recent works have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) show the opposite behavior for node-level classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>But what happens when we are predicting links? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>We show that, in this case, GNNs often exhibit a mixed behavior.More specifically, they may be overconfident in negative predictions while being underconfident in positive ones.Based on this observation, we propose IN-N-OUT, the first-ever method to calibrate GNNs for link prediction.IN-N-OUT is based on two simple intuitions: i) attributing true/false labels to an edge while respecting a GNNs prediction should cause but small fluctuations in that edge's embedding; and, conversely, ii) if we label that same edge contradicting our GNN, embeddings should change more substantially.An extensive experimental campaign shows that IN-N-OUT significantly improves the calibration of GNNs in link prediction, consistently outperforming the baselines available -- which are not designed for this specific task.</p>

(where $pw$ is the pathwidth) (ii) can Coloring be solved in time $pw^{(1-\epsilon)pw}n^{O(1)}$?(iii) can a short reconfiguration between two size-$k$ independent sets be found in time $n^{(1-\epsilon)k}$?Such questions are well-studied: in some cases the answer is No under the SETH, while in others coarse-grained lower bounds are known under the ETH.Even though questions such as the above seem "morally equivalent" as they all ask if a simple DP can be improved, the problems concerned have wildly varying time complexities, ranging from single-exponential FPT to XNLP-complete.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper's main contribution is to show that, despite their varying complexities, these questions are not just morally equivalent, but in fact they are the same question in disguise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>We achieve this by putting forth a natural complexity assumption which we call the Primal Pathwidth-Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (PP-SETH) and which states that 3-SAT cannot be solved in time $(2-\epsilon)^{pw}n^{O(1)}$, for any $\epsilon>0$, where $pw$ is the pathwidth of the primal graph of the input.We then show that numerous fine-grained questions in parameterized complexity, including the ones above, are equivalent to the PP-SETH, and hence to each other.This allows us to obtain sharp fine-grained lower bounds for problems for which previous lower bounds left a constant in the exponent undetermined, but also to increase our confidence in bounds which were previously known under the SETH, because we show that breaking any one such bound requires breaking all (old and new) bounds; and because we show that the PP-SETH is more plausible than the SETH.</p>

We champion the creation of large circuit models (LCMs) that are inherently multimodal, crafted to decode and express the rich semantics and structures of circuit data, thus fostering more resilient, efficient, and inventive design methodologies.Embracing this AI-native philosophy, we foresee a trajectory that transcends the current innovation plateau in EDA, igniting a profound shift-left in electronic design methodology.The envisioned advancements herald not just an evolution of existing EDA tools but a revolution, giving rise to novel instruments of design-tools that promise to radically enhance design productivity and inaugurate a new epoch where the optimization of circuit performance, power, and area (PPA) is achieved not incrementally, but through leaps that redefine the benchmarks of electronic systems' capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) endeavors to leverage offline datasets to craft effective agent policy without online interaction, which imposes proper conservative constraints with the support of behavior policies to tackle the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem.However, existing works often suffer from the constraint conflict issue when offline datasets are collected from multiple behavior policies, i.e., different behavior policies may exhibit inconsistent actions with distinct returns across the state space.To remedy this issue, recent Advantage-Weighted (AW) methods prioritize samples with high advantage values for agent training while inevitably leading to overfitting on these samples.In this paper, we introduce a novel Advantage-Aware Policy Optimization (A2PO) method to explicitly construct advantage-aware policy constraints for offline learning under mixed-quality datasets.Specifically, A2PO employs a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to disentangle the action distributions of intertwined behavior policies by modeling the advantage values of all training data as conditional variables.Then the agent can follow such disentangled action distribution constraints to optimize the advantage-aware policy towards high advantage values.Extensive experiments conducted on both the single-quality and mixed-quality datasets of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that A2PO yields results superior to state-of-the-art counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span></p>
