{"created":"2024-05-12 17:54:50","title":"MedConceptsQA: Open Source Medical Concepts QA Benchmark","abstract":"We present MedConceptsQA, a dedicated open source benchmark for medical concepts question answering. The benchmark comprises of questions of various medical concepts across different vocabularies: diagnoses, procedures, and drugs. The questions are categorized into three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. We conducted evaluations of the benchmark using various Large Language Models. Our findings show that pre-trained clinical Large Language Models achieved accuracy levels close to random guessing on this benchmark, despite being pre-trained on medical data. However, GPT-4 achieves an absolute average improvement of nearly 27%-37% (27% for zero-shot learning and 37% for few-shot learning) when compared to clinical Large Language Models. Our benchmark serves as a valuable resource for evaluating the understanding and reasoning of medical concepts by Large Language Models. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ofir408/MedConceptsQA","sentences":["We present MedConceptsQA, a dedicated open source benchmark for medical concepts question answering.","The benchmark comprises of questions of various medical concepts across different vocabularies: diagnoses, procedures, and drugs.","The questions are categorized into three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.","We conducted evaluations of the benchmark using various Large Language Models.","Our findings show that pre-trained clinical Large Language Models achieved accuracy levels close to random guessing on this benchmark, despite being pre-trained on medical data.","However, GPT-4 achieves an absolute average improvement of nearly 27%-37% (27% for zero-shot learning and 37% for few-shot learning) when compared to clinical Large Language Models.","Our benchmark serves as a valuable resource for evaluating the understanding and reasoning of medical concepts by Large Language Models.","Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ofir408/MedConceptsQA"],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07348v2"}
